1
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:59,291
<i>Hi. I'm Jon.</i>

2
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:03,166
<i>I'm a musical-theater writer.</i>

3
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,583
<i>One of the last of my species.</i>

4
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,916
<i>Sorry. So... so, you know, lately,
I've been hearing this sound.</i>

5
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,375
<i>Everywhere I go,
like a tick, tick, tick...</i>

6
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:22,041
<i>Like a time bomb in some cheesy B-movie
or Saturday morning cartoon.</i>

7
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,875
<i>The fuse has been lit.
The clock counts down the seconds</i>

8
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:30,625
<i>as the flame gets closer,
and closer, and closer,</i>

9
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,791
<i>until... all at once...</i>

10
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,333
<i>This is Jonathan Larson's story.</i>

11
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:50,833
<i>Happy anniversary, I love you so much.</i>

12
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,666
<i>Before the Tony Awards.</i>

13
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:56,708
<i>Before the Pulitzer Prize.</i>

14
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,250
<i>Before...</i>

15
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,083
<i>We dedicate this opening night
and every performance</i>

16
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:03,250
<i>to our friend, Jonathan Larson.</i>

17
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,333
<i>...we lost him.</i>

18
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,000
<i>Everything
you're about to see is true.</i>

19
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:14,583
<i>Except for the parts Jonathan made up.</i>

20
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:27,250
The date is January 26th, 1990.

21
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:31,916
<i>The setting, the barren,
unfashionable no-man's-land</i>

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
<i>between SoHo and Greenwich Village.</i>

23
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,958
I have two keyboards,
a Macintosh computer.

24
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:40,791
<i>A cat.</i>

25
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,666
<i>An impressive collection of compact discs,</i>

26
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>cassettes, and records
of other people's music.</i>

27
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,958
<i>Bookshelves sagging under the weight
of plays and novels I didn't write.</i>

28
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:55,750
<i>I have an original,
dystopian rock musical...</i>

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,416
...that I have spent the last eight years
of my life writing...

30
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,833
<i>...and rewriting, and rewriting.</i>

31
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:11,000
I have rejection letters
from every major and minor producer,

32
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:14,583
theater company, record label,
and film studio in existence.

33
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,333
And in just over a week...

34
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,291
I will be 30 years old.

35
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,166
<i>Older than Stephen Sondheim
when he had his first Broadway show.</i>

36
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,916
<i>Older than Paul McCartney when
he wrote his last song with John Lennon.</i>

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,916
<i>By the time my parents were 30,
they already had two kids,</i>

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,250
<i>they had careers</i>

39
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,708
with steady paychecks, a mortgage.

40
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:43,541
<i>And in eight days,
my youth will be over forever.</i>

41
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,041
And what exactly do I have
to show for myself?

42
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,708
Happy birthday!

I made ten copies.

You are an angel on earth.

69
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,291
- This is the last time. Seriously.
- I know. Thank you.

70
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,975
- No, no, no, I got you.
- I'm gonna pay.

71
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,921
- I don't want you to pay.
- Somebody needs to take out this trash.

72
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,125
So I hear you're moving
out of Jon's place.

73
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,083
That's the end of an era.

74
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,583
We hear him sobbing in the fridge
most mornings. It's very sad.

75
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:47,041
No, no, no.
We are not talking about that.

76
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,375
Wait, Carolyn,
you're coming next Friday, right?

77
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,583
What's happening Friday?

78
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,583
- The <i>Superbia</i> workshop.
- Surprised he hasn't mentioned it.

79
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:54,916
That sounds vaguely familiar.

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,083
Guys, this is the biggest break
I've ever had. This is that moment.

81
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:01,875
It's the first time people are gonna
see the show that aren't just us.

82
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,291
It's good you're not putting
too much pressure on it.

83
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,500
But it's true, though.

84
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:11,083
It's like, you get to a certain age and
you stop being a writer who waits tables

85
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,875
and you become a waiter with a hobby.

86
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,083
Boo-Boo, you need to ask yourself,
in this moment,

87
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,166
are you letting yourself
be led by fear or by love?

You just quit?

112
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,458
Well, no, I didn't just "quit" quit.
I gave... I gave my notice.

113
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:37,291
- That's exactly the same thing.
- No, I have two weeks left.

114
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,625
I'm allowing myself to be led by love.

115

What?

116
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,125
You know, Rosa's got another client.
Craig Carnelia.

117
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,916
This is Rosa your agent,
who hasn't returned your calls in a year?

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,083
Yeah, yeah. That's the one.

119
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:52,291
So she invited the entire theater industry
to Craig's musical workshop last year.

120
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,250
And by intermission, some producer

121
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,250
had already written him
a check for ten thousand dollars.

122
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,666
I just wish that
you didn't have to think like that.

123
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,500
Well, it's expensive to make art.

124
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,541
No, baby, it's expensive to make art here.

125
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,750
Yeah, but worth every penny.

126
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,291

Ladies and gentlemen,
please give it up for our band,

157
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,375
and also for my
very, very, very dear friends,

158
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:57,416
Roger and Karessa on vocals.

159
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,500
Friday night.

160
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,351
<i>Hi, Jonathan, it's Deborah.</i>

161
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,625
<i>Susan dropped off your music
for tonight's dance...</i>

162
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,166
<i>...but I can't get the speakers to work.</i>

163
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,041
- Hey, Pookie.
- Hi.

164
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,208
How was Philly?

165
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,125
I went from the airport
to a conference room

166
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,250
and then back to the airport
three hours later.

167
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,500
- Sounds amazing.
- Mm.

168
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,958
<i>Michael was an amazing actor.</i>

169
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,375
Yeah, he was the lead of every play
in high school, college.

170
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,208
And then we moved to New York.

171
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:35,000
I am sick of waking up at 5:00

172
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,416
to get in line outside
the Equity Building and wait all day,

173
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,208
praying that the director
actually even agrees

174
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,500
to see anyone that's non-union, and then,

175
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,166
when I finally do get in the room, I sing...

176
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,291
I don't know, six measures,
if I'm lucky, before they cut me off

177
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:50,708
and call me the wrong name...

178
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,541
Juan, Pedro, Carlos<i>... lo que sea</i>.

179
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:57,125
And then a week later, he got a job
at a fancy advertising company,

180
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,333
making high five figures.

181
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,958
Healthcare, dental...

182
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,375
He never looked back.

183
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,250
You know, for someone who's broke,

184
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,458
you could probably spend
a little bit less on party planning.

185
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,833
Well, what is the point of money,

186
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,125
if you're not gonna spend it
on the people you love?

187
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,666
- Yeah, except you don't have any money.
- Oh, right.

188
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,875
This has been sitting here for a week.

189
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,166
- I'm on it.
- Mm-hm. Yeah. You seem very on it.

190
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,458
Pretty soon you won't have me around
to remind you to pay your bills on time.

191
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,583
How will I ever survive?

192
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,250
That's a very real question.
Have you found a new roommate yet?

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,416
I've been a little busy. You know.
My workshop is next week.

194
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,750
Wait, what workshop?

195
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,041
That was funny.

196
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,708
What time's the show tonight?

197
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,833
Uh...

198
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,083
- Curtain's at 8:00.
- Mm...

199
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,625
I've heard the dancing's amazing,
but the music sucks.

200
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,208
<i>Susan grew up
in a small town in the Midwest.</i>

201
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,291
<i>She went to college to study biology,</i>

202
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,500
<i>she thought she'd become
a doctor, maybe teach.</i>

203
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:23,166
<i>But then she fell in love</i>...

204
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,333
<i>...with modern dance instead.</i>

205
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:29,250
Every parent's dream, right?

206
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,958
<i>She moved to New York
without knowing a soul.</i>

207
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,666
<i>Four years later, she's already danced</i>

208
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,458
<i>with every major choreographer
in the city.</i>

209
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,416
<i>Paul, Trisha, Merce.</i>

210
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:42,583
1990. This was the year
she was finally gonna join a company.

211
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:46,791
<i>Not just go from job to job.
Actually have a home, an artistic family.</i>

212
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,500
<i>And she was ready.
This was her year. She knew it.</i>

213
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:54,500
And then she fractured her ankle
during a dress rehearsal.

214
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:03,083
<i>Six months of rehab later,
she's dancing again, it's just...</i>

215
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:09,000
<i>whatever that moment was, when she knew...</i>

216
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,166
<i>all of a sudden, she doesn't know anymore.</i>

217
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,000
But Susan is a real artist.

218
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:18,375
She doesn't care about seeing her name
in the <i>New York Times.</i>

219
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:22,750
<i>It doesn't matter to her
if she's dancing in front of five people</i>

220
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,833
<i>or in front of five thousand.</i>

221
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,458
<i>And then there's the matter of us.</i>

222
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,583
Whoo!

223
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,291
<i>♪ Love shack
Baby, love shack ♪</i>

224
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,041
<i>♪ Love shack
Baby, love shack... ♪</i>

225
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,208
You know he can't
afford all of this, right?

226
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,958
Well, he loves making a fuss,
especially about you.

227
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,291
Hm.

228
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,375
After everything we've done for him...

229
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,958
- Stop!
- ...he walks away.

230
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,721
Freddy, look, I'm leaving you my mixtapes.

231
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,375
- Oh!
- You can play them in remembrance of me.

232
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:16,083
Jonathan Larson's famous
Moondance Diner mixtape.

233
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,833
Who doesn't love showtunes
with their French toast?

234
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,625
Actually, it's not just showtunes.
It's a very eclectic mix.

235
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,875
- Someone's very touchy about mixtapes.
- Apparently.

236
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,416
Okay, listen. I'm happy for you.

237
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,916
- I really am.
- Oh, yeah?

238
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,125
I'm also extremely bitter
and jealous and envious,

239
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,791
and sort of hateful towards you right now.

240
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,541
I mean... he's getting out.

241
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,708
And you're gonna be next.

242
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,666
- Well, I got a callback last week.
- Great!

243
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,958
- For a cruise.
- What's wrong with a cruise?

244
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,250
It's an Arctic cruise,
so pretty much everything.

245
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:52,083
Uh, every single thing is wrong with that.
It's in the Arctic.

246
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,958
- How you feeling?
- Um...

247
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,666
It's been a really good week.

248
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,833
T-cell count is good.
My doctor feels cautiously optimistic.

249
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:03,166
Okay, good. You look great.

250
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,750
Oh, my God, thank you. I know.

251
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,083
But for the cruise,
I'm gonna have to sort of...

252
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,625
- Tighten up. Pull it, pull it up.
- Make it tight.

253
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,041
Scott and I, we used to sing madrigals
in high school.

254
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:16,208
- What? Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

255
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,083
I hated singing.
I just did it for the pussy.

256
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:24,250
Ran into Scott in SoHo and he really...
<i>really</i> wanted to come.

257
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:25,791
Got it. Got it.

258
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,291
I never get to go
to artist parties, you know?

259
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,916
It sucks.
The drugs there are always the best.

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,500
Mm. Mm-hm...

261
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,833
- Scott's in finance.
- Shocking.

262
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:38,375
- Yeah. What do you do?
- I'm the future of musical theater, Scott.

263
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:45,208
Welcome. I'm gonna get another drink.

264
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,625

Hi. Everyone's leaving.

00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,958
- I just needed some fresh air.
- Okay.

300
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,833
It's freezing up here.

00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,000
Where is your coat?

It's at the bottom of a very large pile.

304
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,125
Oh!

305
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,500
Mm.

306
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,791
Wow. That's pretty.

307
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:07,875
That's the prison barge.

308
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,750
Oh, yeah.

309
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:17,833
I heard, uh, in Jacob's Pillow, they're
hiring new teachers for the dance school.

310
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,416
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

311
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,166
Work a couple of hours a week.
Then the rest of the time is yours.

312
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,166
- Free studio space whenever you want.
- Hey... Whoa...

313
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,208
- Can we just talk for a second?
- Mm.

314
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,000
Can we just talk about
how amazing you were tonight?

315
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,125
- Thank you.
- I am not messing around.

316
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,708
I could just watch you dancing forever.

317
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,500
I was thinking of maybe applying.

318
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,208
- Hm?
- To the job in Jacob's Pillow.

319
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,500
- We went there last summer, remember?
- Oh.

320
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,833
We saw the new Mark Morris.

321
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:55,458
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

322
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,666
- That's the place in the Berkshires?
- Mm-hm.

323
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,916
So, you're gonna move to the Berkshires?

324
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,041
And not have to work
30 hours a week doing word processing

325
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,208
to pay the rent, why not?

326
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,708
I might actually be able
to get back into shape.

327
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,875
Okay. Yeah. All right.
Let's do it. Let's move.

328
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,875
- I'm being serious.
- Hey, I'm being serious.

329
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:21,375
We're gonna live in a log cabin.
We're gonna hunt... acorns.

330
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,708
We're gonna...
We're gonna gather squirrels.

331
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,500
What are you even talking about?

332
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,458
It's the Berkshires.

333
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,208
People have vacation homes there.
You've been there.

334
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,666
I'm so sorry.
Can we... Can we please go inside?

335
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,291
Sorry, I just feel like I'm scared...

336
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,541
I'm beginning
to lose sensation in my extremities.

337
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,166
You are such a baby.

338
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,125
Take this.

339
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,541
Whoa. Hold on.

340
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,291
You like?

341
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,333
I thought that you were in a hurry
to get back inside.

342
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,458
You know that job in the Berkshires?

343
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,416
- Yeah, sounds amazing.
- I already applied for it.

344
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,958
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

345
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:22,958
- And I got it.
- Oh...

346
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,333
- Oh, yeah? That's great.
- Yeah.

347
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,375
It starts in June.

348
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,625
Okay. So this is just for the summer?

349
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,541
No. Mm-mm, it's permanent.

350
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,125
Jon?

351
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,000
Whoa, the Berkshires?

352
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,791
That is, like, so far from Midtown.

353
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,541
Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,541
Why is she doing this right now?

355
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:51,041
And she says,
"I want you to come with me."

356
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,083
- What did you say?
- I said, "Oh?"

357
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,833
What am I supposed to say?
I didn't know what to say.

358
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,666
I mean, like, I can't...
I can't leave New York.

359
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,000
- Oh, tell her to move in with you.
- Move in where?

360
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,583
You need a new roommate, right?

361
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,625
It's two birds, one stone.
You are very welcome.

362
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,625
Okay, so, what... what about the guy
that you were dating? David?

363
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:16,500
- I thought you guys were great together.
- It didn't work out.

364
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,458
Oh. There's a focus group
at the office this week,

365
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,583
and they're looking for a few more people.
How about I sign you up?

366
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,333
So you can lure me to the dark side?

367
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,000
No! So I can introduce you
to my colleagues,

368
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,000
and show them how brilliant you are.

369
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,500
I don't want a job in advertising.

370
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,541
I don't want you
to have a job in advertising.

371
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,666
I want you to have a job in...
jingle writing.

372
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,625
No, listen.

373
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,250
You come up with jingles
all the time for fun, Jon.

374
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,375
You come up with songs
about cereal we're eating.

375
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,500
You could get paid for that.

376
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,291
Well, you know,
when <i>Superbia</i> gets produced,

377
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,708
I will be getting paid
for my music anyway. So...

378
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,583
That's true.

379
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:03,541
And we are here.
Home sweet home.

380

00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,000
- You do need it.
- You know...

456
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:31,208
...you're the only person
who ever said that.

457
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,375
Just so you know.

458
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,708
You're telling me in the five years
you've been writing this musical...

459
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,083
Eight years, actually.

460
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,708
...no one else has told you
that you're missing a song

461
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:41,208
for Elizabeth in the second act?

462
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:44,625
No one.

463
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,208
<i>Okay, I'm lying.</i>

464
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:53,541
One person <i>did</i> say that.

It was.

481

<i>Stephen Sondheim.</i>

482
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,250
All right, I'll start.

483
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,708
I'm lost.

484
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,625
I... I don't know what the show is.

485
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:26,458
Is it social commentary?
Is it science fiction?

486
00:28:26,541 --> 00:28:30,458
And the music is the same thing.
Is it rock? Is it Broadway? Is it both?

487
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:33,166
Is it neither? Steve, what did you think?

488
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,583
I have to say,
I disagree pretty strongly, Walter.

489
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,791
I think this is a musical
that knows exactly what it is.

490
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,958
Yes. Yes. Of course, yes. Abso...

491
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:50,291
The world that you've created
is really original.

492
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,958
It's fascinating.

493
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:57,208
The problem is, it's not particularly easy
to follow the emotional thread.

494
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:01,583
The details distract us
from connecting with the characters.

495
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,333
- Does that make sense?
- Okay. Okay.

496
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:06,416
Yes, yes. We're on the same page.
That's exactly how I felt.

497
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,416
We're saying the same thing,
just differently.

498
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,875
But the music, okay, I'm sorry...
The music just wasn't there.

499
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,208
I actually...
I thought the songs were swell.

500
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:19,500
Yeah, okay... Yes. Yes.
The <i>individual </i>songs.

501
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:24,000
I particularly like the one the young man
sings at the end of the first act.

502
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,416
First rate lyric and tune. Well done.

503
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,208
<i>"First rate lyric and tune."</i>

504
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:33,291
Thank you.

505
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:38,708
Those five words were enough
to keep me going for the next two years.

506
00:29:40,833 --> 00:29:44,625
You're missing a song
for the young woman. Uh...

507
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,208
- Elizabeth?
- Elizabeth.

508
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:48,458
It's the turning point in the show.

509
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:51,750
Your protagonist is either gonna go
in this direction or that direction.

510
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,625
Someone has to wake him up,
shake some sense into him.

511
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:57,333
Okay.

512
00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:02,125
It's so funny because I was
gonna say the exact same thing.

513
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,583
Can we talk musicians?
Because if it's only gonna be four,

514
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,291
then I gotta figure out how
I'm gonna split up the bass parts.

515
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,916
This is for you. Here you go.

516
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,416
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Uh...

517
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,666
- Jon, this is a reading.
- Mm.

518
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,916
You'll have a piano.

519
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,375
I wrote a rock score.

520
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:23,833
So, at the very least I'll need a synth
and drums and a guitar and...

521
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:28,125
A great song should sound great
without any instruments.

522
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,500
Mm. Okay.

523
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,166
Let's just do the song as a cappella.

524
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:34,500
Oh, actually, you know what?
Maybe we'll just skip the songs,

525
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,666
and then we can get the audience
in and out in half an hour.

526
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,416
I will take a look at the budget

527
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,000
and I will see if I can dig up
some money for another musician.

528
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:44,125
Two more.

529
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,916
And piano is the absolute
bare minimum for this.

530
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,250
Have you spoken to Rosa?

531
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,583
Hey, Rosa, this is Jonathan Larson,
your client.

532
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:58,208
I've left multiple messages
with your secretary.

533
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:01,541
- Rosa Stevens is still your agent, right?
- Oh, yeah. No, yeah, we...

534
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:02,625
We talk constantly.

535
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:05,833
Has she sent out the invites
for the presentation yet?

536
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,958
We haven't gotten a lot of RSVPs.

537
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,500
- It's fine.
- Mm.

538
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,791
Nobody has more contacts
in the industry than Rosa.

539
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,625
I'm sure she'll get some
good people there for you.

540
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,500
Yeah, yeah.

541

What?

659
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,583
He woke up Saturday morning
with a fever, he could...

660
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,500
He couldn't stop shivering.

661
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,666
Wait, wait, no. Wait.

662
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:16,583
La... He told me last week
his T-cell count...

663
00:39:16,666 --> 00:39:20,083
The doctor said that it was exactly
where they wanted it, four days ago.

664
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,750
I guess it changed.

665
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:24,791
Shit.

666
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:32,250
- He's gonna be fine.
- Yeah, you know... you're right.

667
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,375
I mean it. He's gonna be fine.
Think about it.

668
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,208
You know how stubborn he is.
He's a pain in the ass.

669
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,958
- Right?
- Yeah.

670
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:41,791
Frankly, we should be pissed at him
that he's left us understaffed<i>.</i>

671
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,083
- At Sunday brunch.
- Right.

672
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,666
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

673
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,750
Okay.

674
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:54,541
<i>Freddy, shit!
I should go to the hospital.</i>

675
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,125
When am I gonna go to the hospital?
I need to write.

676
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,375
When am I gonna write?
I need to talk to Susan.

677
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:02,625
I need to see Freddy. I should call Susan.
Why can't I write this song?

678
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:05,166
<i>How can you possibly be thinking

00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,958
<i>I need to leave.
I need to walk out that door and go.</i>

682
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:18,000
But it's 9:30 on a Sunday morning
at the Moondance Diner.

683
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,541
I'm not going anywhere.

684
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:23,875
Eggs up!

685
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:31,750
Do you have any of that
wonderful Jewish bread?

686
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:35,291
It's "holly," dear.
They call it "holly" bread.

687
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,125
Would you like some challah bread?

688
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,976
Somebody pick up these eggs.

689
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,583
<i>Tranquilo, tranquilo.</i>

690
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:42,083
<i>Ya, tranquilo. ¡Termina tu obra!</i>

691
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:45,875
Harrington for four.
Harrington? Harrington?

692
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,791
Uh, ex...

693
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,916
Moondance. What do you want?

694
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
That was a <i>Ghostbusters</i> reference.

695
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,041
Do we take reservations?
No, we do not... We're a diner.

696
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,916
- Where's my rye bread?
- Name, please?

697
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,916
- Richard.
- Richard. How many?

698
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,625
- Caplan.
- Richard Caplan.

699
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,208
How many in your party?

700
00:41:07,291 --> 00:41:09,458
- With a "C."
- Got it. How many in your party?

701
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:11,666
"C" as in "cat."

702
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,375
- I understand.
- Can we order?

703
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:14,858
One second. How many in your party?

704
00:41:14,916 --> 00:41:17,083
It's not a math test.

705
00:41:17,166 --> 00:41:19,250
Order.

706
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,250
Thank you for your patience.

707
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,500
I said an omelet with no yolks.

708
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:26,916
This is why you're just a waiter.

709
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,500
Tension.

710
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,916
Major vomit situation in the ladies' room.

711
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,666
- Check!
- Can we get two more mimosas, please?

712
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,583
'Cause she got a new job, okay?

713
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,500
Either put some Baileys in this coffee

714
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,791
or put some vodka
in this orange juice, please.

715
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,625
Something.

716
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,291

717
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,333

720
00:41:59,875 --> 00:42:02,000

721
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,708

722
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:07,708

On behalf of Playwrights Horizons,
I want to welcome everyone

790
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:52,500
and thank you all for taking part
in this very exciting new musical

791
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:56,166
by a very exciting young writer,
Jonathan Larson.

792
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,375
He's not even 30.

793
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,833
Oh, wow. Thank you, Ira.

794
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:09,208
Um... this is the first real workshop
that this musical has ever had.

795
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:12,708
And now you guys are part of the family.

796
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:16,458
So, any questions
before we, uh, get going?

797
00:47:18,333 --> 00:47:19,958
- Yeah, no. Yeah.
- Um...

798
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:24,375
Could you... um...
Could you explain it, maybe?

799
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah. Explain what?

800
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,458
Oh, just the musical. The story.

801
00:47:30,541 --> 00:47:34,625
It's a little, um, confusing
in certain places. Not in a bad way.

802

<i>Superbia,</i> a satire set in the future
on a poisoned planet Earth,

803
00:47:39,583 --> 00:47:43,083
where the vast majority of humanity
spend their entire lives

804
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:47,208
just staring at the screens
of their media transmitters,

805
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:51,708
watching the tiny elite
of the rich and powerful,

806
00:47:51,791 --> 00:47:56,166
who film their own fabulous lives
like TV shows.

807
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:02,666
A world where human emotion
has been outlawed.

808
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:07,916
This will be the first musical written
for the MTV generation.

I wasn't sure if it was all, like, aliens.

811
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:18,208
Nope, not aliens. Um...
But it is set in the future.

Good night. Wonderful work.
Really wonderful work.

No...
I... I told you I needed a band.

It's 100 dollars for every musician.

825
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:07,291
Yeah. And your annual operating budget
is half a million dollars?

826
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:10,625
So far we're up to 12 RSVPs, Jon.

827
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:12,748
You don't need a band
with an audience of 12 people.

828
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:13,916
You'll outnumber them.

If you want more musicians,

830
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:21,125
you're gonna have to find
the money for it somewhere else.

831
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:23,291
I'm sorry.

832

That is beautiful, Mr. Larson.

1063
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:27,208
Wow. Okay. That goes on the board.

1064
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:30,708
- The sun.
- Sunrise.

1065
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:32,916
The dawn of a new day.

1066
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,083
- Oh! Where did you come from?
- It all goes back.

1067
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:38,958
- You're amazing.
- That is incredible.

1068
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:41,041
A window looking out on a field.

1069
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:44,500
Oh, and I look out, and I see
the bunnies and little squirrelies...

1070
01:03:44,583 --> 01:03:46,625
The beating heart of the nation.

1071
01:03:47,125 --> 01:03:49,291
- Ooh!
- Oh, my gosh.

1072
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:52,041
- Absolutely. That's absolutely what it is.
- Beautiful.

1073
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:55,208
- I've never even heard that before.
- You are gifted.

1074
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,500
I could get used to this.

1075
01:03:58,583 --> 01:04:00,916
<i>I could get paid for this.</i>

1076
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,666
I could get health care. A 401.

1077
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:10,125
A BMW. A luxury apartment...
on Central Park West.

1078
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,791
No, no, no... East.

1079
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:18,041
<i>I could actually be rewarded
for my creativity,</i>

1080
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:21,416
instead of rejected and ignored.

1081
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:24,416
This could be the rest of my life.

1082
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:29,166
Now that we have all those
fabulous ideas of yours in our heads,

1083
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:32,125
we are going to turn to the task at hand.

1084
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:36,916
We are here to develop a name
of a revolutionary consumer product

1085
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,208
that is just about to hit your shelves.

1086
01:04:39,291 --> 01:04:40,500
Oh. Wow.

1087
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,791
This is where we're gonna need

1088
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:44,458
that incredible imagination
of yours, Mr. Larson.

1089
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:48,708
So the product we're looking at
is a tasteless, odorless chemical compound

1090
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:51,625
that will be used as
a fat substitute in cooking.

1091
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:52,583
Mm.

1092
01:04:52,666 --> 01:04:57,083
And it's been successfully tested
on a number of mammals.

1093
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,958
Well, that's good. Mm.

1094
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,201
There are some side effects
associated with the product

1095
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,125
that I've been instructed
to tell you about.

1096
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:05,000
So it's skin scales.

1097
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:07,458
Um... full hair loss.

1098
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:10,125
Hair, eyebrows, eyelashes...

1099
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,458
This could be the rest of my life.

1100
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:15,458
And finally, in a small number of users,

1101
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:18,166
there were reports
of toxic shock syndrome...

1102
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:22,375
resulting in a brief hospitalization.

1103
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:25,416
- Eh, no big deal.
- There are no bad ideas.

1104
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,333
- Free oil.
- Love it.

1105
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:31,291
- Oil free.
- Okay.

1106
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:35,208
- That's the same thing she just said.
- I switched the words around.

1107
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:37,541
That's totally fine, Kim.
Thank you so much.

1108
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,458
- The American Dream.
- Okay, well...

1109
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:41,250
- Dreams of freedom.
- Okay.

1110
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:43,666
- Nutra-oil.
- That's not bad, Todd.

1111
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:45,750
Waist oil. No.

1112
01:05:52,541 --> 01:05:53,708
I got it.

1113
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:59,666
- I have it. I have the exact...
- Go, go!

1114
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:03,083
You wanna hear? I got the exact
right thing for this product.

1115
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,500
Chubstitute.

1116
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,875
<i>Chubstitute?</i>

1117
01:06:11,958 --> 01:06:14,375
- It's a joke.
- It's not funny.

1118
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,375
- Well, maybe not to you but...
- I recommended you, Jon.

1119
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,458
I put my name on the line for you.

1120
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,875
- Tell them I had a stroke.
- It isn't funny.

1121
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:27,916
This is my life.

1122
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,541
No, it's not your life, it's advertising.

1123
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:33,708
It's figuring out how to trick people

1124
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,833
into buying shit that they don't want.

1125
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:39,000
Actually, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1126
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:41,833
I don't understand how
you can take any of this seriously.

1127
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:44,166
- Because they pay me to.
- Money isn't everything.

1128
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,833
- Well, it doesn't hurt.
- Are you sure about that?

1129
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,541
What are you doing with your life
that's so noble?

1130
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:55,375
- I'm making art.
- That's what the world needs. More art.

1131
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:59,416
Actually, yes. And at least
I'm not perpetuating a system that's...

1132
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,958
Spare the self-righteousness, Jon.

1133
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:02,761
You're writing musicals
in your living room,

1134
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:04,500
you're not saving the rainforest.

1135
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,416
Wow.

1136
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:11,833
Gosh, I wish I could be more like you,

1137
01:07:11,916 --> 01:07:14,916
and spend my life caring
about driving the right car

1138
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,392
and wearing the right suits
and living in a doorman building.

1139
01:07:17,416 --> 01:07:20,375
Why shouldn't I want those things, Jon?
Not all of us have options you do.

1140
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,625
All the things that you take for granted.

1141
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:25,375
- What? Like what?
- Like a life with the person you love.

1142
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:30,416
Do you know what I would give for that?
You... You turn your nose up at it.

1143
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,125
If that's what you want,
what's stopping you?

1144
01:07:33,208 --> 01:07:36,833
What's stopping me? How about
Jesse Helms and the Moral Majority?

1145
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:39,083
How about the people
that run this country?

1146
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:41,541
I can't get married. I can't have kids.

1147
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:46,625
Half our friends are dying and the other
half are scared to death they are next.

1148
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:49,291
So, I'm sorry for getting a nice car, Jon.

1149
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,958
I'm sorry for moving into
an apartment with central heating.

1150
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:56,750
I'm sorry for enjoying my life
while I still have time.

1151
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:57,875
I gotta go.

1152
01:07:57,958 --> 01:07:59,083
Hey.

1153
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:01,833
You wanna come take the subway?

1154
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,916
- I'd rather walk.
- Michael.

1155
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Michael.

1156
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:15,458
Hello?

1157
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:18,416
<i>Johnny, darling. It's Rosa.</i>

1158
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,333
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Rosa Stevens?

1159
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:25,833
- Are we excited for tomorrow?
<i>- Tomorrow?</i>

1160
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:28,501
The presentation.
You remembered the presentation?

1161
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:31,583
Remembered it?
I got every producer in town coming.

1162
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:34,791
<i>So it better be good.</i>

1163
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:39,500
Yeah, it's, uh... it's gonna be amazing.

1164
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:42,208
Let's see if we can't get
a bidding war started

1165
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,916
on this musical of yours. What do you say?

1166
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:48,208
Yes, sure.

1167
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,166
Okay, doll.

1168
01:08:50,250 --> 01:08:53,833
Charlie, get me Hal Prince on the line.

1169
01:08:53,916 --> 01:08:55,250
Rosa? Um, I...

1170
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,750
I'm so sorry.

1171
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,208
Yeah. I know, I know, I know.

1172
01:09:54,666 --> 01:09:56,083
Oh, no.

1173
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:59,791
Why wouldn't you have called me
to tell me my payment was late

1174
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,000
before you just cut off my power?

1175
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:04,291
How is...? How does that make sense?

1176
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:06,601
<i>Sir, as I explained before,
you received a notice...</i>

1177
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,208
No, no, no, listen.

1178
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,500
You don't understand. I have a workshop.

1179
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:14,500
I have a public presentation
of my musical in 12 hours...

1180
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:17,166
<i>Sir, if you are going to raise your voice...</i>

1181
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1182
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:22,208
Look, look, look.
I can pay you over the phone, right now.

1183
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:25,875
- I have my credit card right here...
<i>- The billing office is closed.</i>

1184
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,416
I would love to figure it out right now.

1185
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,666
<i>The billing office is closed
for the night.</i>

1186
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:35,416
- What am I gonna do?
<i>- Sir, like I've said, call...</i>

1187
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:52,125
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, Beth. Hey.

1188
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,666
How are you? It's Jon.

1189
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,791
<i>Hi, Jon.</i>

1190
01:10:55,875 --> 01:10:58,708
Hi, um... is Susan there?

1191
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:00,583
<i>She doesn't wanna talk to you, Jon.</i>

1192
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Yeah.

1193
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:05,875
Um...

1194
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:08,291
Sure, sure. Uh...

1195
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:12,375
Well, can you... um...
can you give her a message for me?

1196
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:15,208
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Well, it's just, you know...

1197
01:11:16,250 --> 01:11:20,333
I wanted to remind her that tomorrow
is my workshop and you know, I...

1198
01:11:21,041 --> 01:11:24,000
I know I don't have any right to ask this.
It's just that...

1199
01:11:25,916 --> 01:11:28,250
I would just really love her to be there.

1200
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,500
<i>I'll tell her you called.</i>

1201
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,833
<i>Here I am.</i>

1202
01:11:41,125 --> 01:11:44,541
The musical to which
I have devoted my youth

1203
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:49,750
is about to be put on public display
for every producer in New York.

1204
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:56,083
I haven't written a single note
or a single lyric

1205
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:59,625
of the most important song in the show.

1206
01:12:01,375 --> 01:12:03,166
I have no electricity.

1207
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:08,375
My best friend is furious with me.
My girlfriend isn't speaking to me.

1208
01:12:09,375 --> 01:12:13,000
And there is only
one thing I can think of to do:

1209
01:12:15,625 --> 01:12:16,625
Swim.

1210
01:12:24,916 --> 01:12:29,333
<i>♪ I hate this locker room
Why won't Susan answer my calls? ♪</i>

1211
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:32,833
<i>♪ Sweat, wet, echo
Smell, hell, rap ♪</i>

1212
01:12:32,916 --> 01:12:35,791
<i>♪ Pump up the volume

1254
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:48,791
Hi.

1255
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:51,291
Hey, boy genius.

1256
01:15:53,541 --> 01:15:55,500
I'm turning 30 on Sunday, you know.

1257
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:57,791
Oh, well, happy birthday.

1258
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,500
Thank you.

1259
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:03,458
- Thirty's still young, you know.
- No one's here.

1260
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:06,583
Oh. It's not even 9:00.

1261
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:11,166
The presentation doesn't start till 10:00.

1262
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:17,791
Oh...

1263
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:19,750
That's good.

1264
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,208
Cool.

1265
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:24,416
Okay.

1266
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:27,416
- Can you sight read?
- Yeah.

1267
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,500
<i>Slowly, miraculously,
people start to show up.</i>

1268
01:16:37,583 --> 01:16:40,291
- Johnny.
- Be right back.

1269
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:43,708
This is phenomenal.
Look at the space, it's just phenomenal.

1270
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:47,333
- It's a rehearsal studio, Dad.
- It's a Broadway rehearsal studio.

1271
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,416
- This is the real thing.
- We're so excited for you, dear.

1272
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,875
- Thank you.
- Are they paying you?

1273
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:56,166
No.

1274
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,458
- Next time.
- Sure.

1275
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:01,208
- Oh, look, for us.
- No, that's not...

1276
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:04,333
- That's for someone else, actually.
- Mm. Do you like that?

1277
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:08,416
You can literally sit in any other seat.

1278
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,291
- Okay. Break a leg.
- Shall we sit there?

1279
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,791
- I love you. Thank you.
- I love you.

1280
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,958
His hair is ridiculous.

1281
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,083
Good turnout.

1282
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:33,875
Yeah, mostly friends.

1283
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,708
Mm, what a nightmare.

1284
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:45,416
Thank you... for being here.

1285
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:49,625
Wild horses, Jon. You know that.

1286
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:56,375
- Oh! Okay. Break legs.
- Yeah.

1287
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:01,791
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

1288
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,875
Ira, you son of a gun.

1289
01:18:04,958 --> 01:18:08,166
- Jonathan, how are you?
- Rosa.

1290
01:18:09,958 --> 01:18:12,541
- Jon Larson.
- Oh, there he is.

1291
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:16,750
Just the man I'm looking for.
You nervous? Don't be nervous.

1292
01:18:16,833 --> 01:18:19,833
- Yeah. A little nervous. Sure.
- Of course you're nervous.

1293
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:24,791
The first presentation of your musical is
like having a colonoscopy in Times Square.

1294
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,416
Only with a colonoscopy,
the worst thing that could happen

1295
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,333
is you find out you have cancer.

1296
01:18:29,416 --> 01:18:32,958
With a musical,
you find out you're already dead.

1297
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:38,416
Have a good show.
Can't wait to see what you did.

1298
01:18:44,791 --> 01:18:47,541
We can't keep waiting. It's quarter past.

1299
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:49,208
I know. I know. I know.

1300
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:51,333
- Break a leg.
- Okay.

1301
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:54,041
Come here. Thank you.

1302
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:13,208
Hello. Hi, welcome.

1303
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,041
I'm Jonathan Larson.

1304
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:20,583
Whoa... Hey, well...

1305
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:24,625
You don't have to do that.
Thank you so much, that was very kind. Uh...

1306
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:27,416
Thank you for being here,
um, this morning.

1307
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,833
This is, um...

1308
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:37,666
- That's Stephen Sondheim.
- Right. Like I was saying...

1309
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,000
Thank you all for being here.
This is my musical, <i>Superbia,</i>

1310
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:45,166
and I've been working on it for...
a little while now.

1311
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:49,458
And I just really hope you all like it.

1312
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,291
Thank you.

1313
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:05,583

<i>- Hi, honey, it's Rosa.</i>

1370
01:24:52,958 --> 01:24:54,916
Hi, Rosa. Thank you so much for calling.

1371
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,791
Well, you already left six messages.

1372
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:02,083
Yeah. Um...
So have you heard anything yet?

1373
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:07,125
Honey, I have heard nothing
but raves all day long.

1374
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,708
I'm getting call after call after call.

1375
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,083
Wow.

1376
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:15,375
Okay. Yes! That's great news.

1377
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:19,041
Everyone is telling me the same thing.
"That Jonathan Larson!"

1378
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:22,041
"I can't wait to see what he does next."

1379
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:26,666
What do you mean, what I do next?
What about <i>Superbia?</i>

1380
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,083
I always told you, it was a tough sell.

1381
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:33,208
It's too arty for Broadway.

1382
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:36,500
<i>Tourists aren't gonna shell out 50 dollars</i>

1383
01:25:36,583 --> 01:25:39,083
<i>to see a show about spaceships and robots.</i>

1384
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:42,833
Um... That's not what it's about. Um...

1385
01:25:42,916 --> 01:25:45,541
<i>Well, of course, I know that, Jonathan.</i>

1386
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:49,583
But you know these producers, they care
about one thing and one thing only.

1387
01:25:49,666 --> 01:25:54,541
Okay. Uh... So what about Off-Broadway?

1388
01:25:54,625 --> 01:25:57,083
It's too expensive for Off.

1389
01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,958
<i>You got a cast of thousands,
with the special effects...</i>

1390
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:03,416

1391
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,476
<i>- Listen, sweetie, I gotta run.</i>
- I'm sorry, Rosa...

1392
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:08,708
Congratulations
on a terrific presentation.

1393
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,208
<i>Rosa, Rosa, hold on.</i>

1394
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,750
So, okay...

1395
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:16,041
So what am I supposed to do now?

1396
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:21,041
You start writing the next one.

1397
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:25,208
<i>And after you finish that one,
you start on the next.</i>

1398
01:26:25,291 --> 01:26:31,000
And on and on, and that's
what it is to be a writer, honey.

1399
01:26:31,791 --> 01:26:34,541
<i>You just keep throwing them

Listen.

<i>Little advice from someone who's
been in this business a long, long time?</i>

1403
01:26:54,500 --> 01:27:00,208
On the next one, maybe
try writing about what you know.

1404
01:27:04,208 --> 01:27:05,583
<i>Okay, kiddo?</i>

1405
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,250
Yeah.

1406
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:11,416
Start sharpening those pencils.

1407
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,666
Yeah, yeah.

1408
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:27,791
I think let's give it a minute
and see what happens next week.

1409
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,291
Hey, I need a job.

1410
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:32,750
- Can you hold on a second?
- I'll apologize to the focus group lady.

1411
01:27:32,833 --> 01:27:35,916
I will never say anything bad
about marketing research ever again,

1412
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,333
I swear to God.

1413
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:39,208
I'm gonna call you right back.

1414
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:41,291
I wanna do what you do.
I wanna have what you have.

1415
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:45,666
I want the BMW, I want the doorman,
I want it, I want all of it. Okay?

1416
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,875
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's good. It's good.

1417
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:49,916
I just spent
the last eight years killing myself

1418
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,041
on a musical that's never gonna happen.

1419
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:55,333
I find that very hard to believe.
It was incredible this morning.

1420
01:27:55,416 --> 01:27:57,875
Well... But not incredible enough.

1421
01:27:58,375 --> 01:27:59,708
I can't do it again, Mike.

1422
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:03,333
I can't stomach five more years
of waiting tables,

1423
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:06,708
five more years of writing things
that no one will ever see

1424
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:08,875
while Broadway just churns out
mega-musicals

1425
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:12,125
without a hint of even
the slightest thing original

1426
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:16,416
or, God forbid, something
to actually say about the world!

1427
01:28:17,708 --> 01:28:18,916
Are you done?

1428
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:22,666
- No, actually...
- The presentation, Jon, it was amazing.

1429
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:26,625
It would be a tragedy
to give up what you have.

1430
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:30,500
- You did it.
- Please!

1431
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:32,583
I was a mediocre actor.

1432
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:35,916
Do you know how many mediocre actors
there are in New York City?

1433
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,958
Do you know how many
Jonathan Larsons there are?

1434
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:40,958
One.

1435
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:45,916
I can't keep wasting my time, Mike.

1436
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,416
- I turn 30 in two days.
- And?

1437
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:53,750
And Stephen Sondheim was 27
when he had his first show on Broadway.

1438
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:56,791
Well, guess what? You're not
Stephen Sondheim. Wait a little longer...

1439
01:28:56,875 --> 01:28:59,351
I'm not waiting anymore.
I can't keep waiting. This is my life.

1440
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:02,083
- I understand.
- No, you don't. I'm running out of time.

1441
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:06,875
- You are not running out of time.
- You don't know anything about it.

1442
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:08,541
I'm HIV-positive.

1443
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:17,833
What?

1444
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,250
- How long have you known?
- A few days.

1445
01:29:31,166 --> 01:29:32,250
Who knows?

1446
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,416
I might get lucky. People do.

1447
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:40,000
Live a year, longer even.

1448
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:46,625
Anyway, I think I might know
a thing or two about running out of time.

1449
01:29:47,708 --> 01:29:49,208
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1450
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:56,750
You tried.

1451

1453
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:11,583
- Mike...
- I can't talk about this now, please.

1454
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:18,500
Jill. Hey, it's Michael.

1455
01:30:18,583 --> 01:30:21,166
