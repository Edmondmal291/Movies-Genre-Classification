1
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ohh,
you're so good.</font>

2
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ohh, yes.
I am the best, baby.</font>

3
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, yeah!
- Oh. Oh, that was a tit.</font>

4
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a tit! Yes!</font>

5
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're so big!</font>

6
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that's right, baby.</font>

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, doggie wants to hide his bone.
- Yes!</font>

8
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah!
I'm bone smugglin', baby.</font>

9
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, would you shut up!</font>

10
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.</font>

11
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah.
Sweet dreams. Good night, Mom.</font>

12
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kiss good night.</font>

13
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something wrong with the reception?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.</font>

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's... There's this nature show that I'm trying to watch.
- Take it off.</font>

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And the birds are all scrambled and I can't even...
- Do me! Yes!</font>

16
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby! Ride me like a pony!</font>

17
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing must be broken or I
sat on the remote or something.</font>

18
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Getting ready for bed, son?
- Yup, I'm all set, Dad. I'm all set.</font>

19
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- No! No, I think he's tried to watch some illegal channels.</font>

20
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:24,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Illegal... Illegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.</font>

21
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?</font>

22
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ooh, baby!
- You know what? Here. Just give me this, please...</font>

23
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this...</font>

24
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. Let's, uh... What the hell's
the matter with this thing?</font>

25
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

26
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

27
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Illegal channels?
Shit!</font>

28
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's any channel that should be
illegal, it's that "all-woman's" channel.</font>

29
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:58,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lifetime supply of pantyhose or some shit.
- Yeah.</font>

30
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh, did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?</font>

31
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Ariel, man. She's so hot!</font>

32
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She's a mermaid, dude.
- Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.</font>

33
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's
party. We got to go. It'll be great.</font>

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why? All that happens at Stifler's
parties is people get drunk and do it.</font>

35
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

36
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, come on, Kevin.
Open it.</font>

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
You got in.</font>

38
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think so,
just open it.</font>

39
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...</font>

41
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected."</font>

42
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!</font>

43
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:49,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got in.
- Yes! I love you!</font>

44
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

45
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?</font>

46
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've worn that shirt for,
like, 3 days in a row, man!</font>

47
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys.
She said it.</font>

48
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Said what?
- She said she loves me.</font>

49
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?
- Oh, man!</font>

50
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cornell's not
that far from "U" of "M."</font>

51
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's only,
like, 7 hours.</font>

52
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and you get
to drive across Canada.</font>

53
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Beautiful country.
- Whatever. It's doable.</font>

54
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wh-What we should
do today, in band.</font>

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:28,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead of playing our instruments
regularly, we should play them backwards.</font>

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That'll be so funny!
- Yeah.</font>

57
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offense, but you're talking about a
post-high school, long-distance relationship.</font>

58
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you and Kevin
haven't even done it yet.</font>

59
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not why
we're going out.</font>

60
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?</font>

61
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have sex
when he's ready and I'm ready.</font>

62
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's got to be
completely perfect.</font>

63
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want the right time, the right moment,
the right place...</font>

64
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. It's sex.</font>

65
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.</font>

66
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?</font>

67
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?</font>

68
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Same ol'...
- Finch. You got the Latin homework?</font>

69
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:15,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

70
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means, "My dog ate it."
It's Latin. It's a joke.</font>

71
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:22,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a Latin joke.
- Yeah, Latin. Just drink your coffee.</font>

72
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?</font>

73
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm drinking, it's mochaccino.
It's not coffee.</font>

74
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Nova!</font>

75
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, dude?</font>

76
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You comin' to the party
tonight, Ozzie, you fuckface?</font>

77
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, depends if my date
wants to stop by.</font>

78
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:39,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm workin' on somethin' new.
- I got an idea about something new.</font>

79
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about you guys
actually locate your dicks,</font>

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!</font>

81
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.</font>

82
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:51,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.</font>

83
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll look for you in the no-fucking
section.</font>

84
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:02,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. I'm shooting for a
9:00 E.T.A. beer in hand by 5 after.</font>

85
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breath check.</font>

86
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

87
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- So, you got something up your sleeve for tonight?</font>

88
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.</font>

89
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a serious question
to ask you guys. Okay.</font>

90
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.</font>

91
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, do you think she would prefer...</font>

92
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Laid-back Jim...</font>

93
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:36,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or...</font>

94
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool, hip Jim?</font>

95
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.</font>

96
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Correct me if I'm wrong but
you're the one with the girlfriend...</font>

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're still
stranded on third base.</font>

98
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, at least I know what
third base feels like, okay?</font>

99
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. Batboy.</font>

100
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

101
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, uh...</font>

102
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly does
third base feel like?</font>

103
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna
take this one?</font>

104
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like warm apple pie.
- Yeah? Yeah.</font>

105
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:11,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Apple pie, huh?</font>

106
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">McDonald's or homemade?</font>

107
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen,
destiny awaits.</font>

108
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> It's been one week
since you looked at me </i></font>

109
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Cocked your head to the side
and said, I'm angry </i></font>

110
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's number 5 and 6
for the Stif-meister!</font>

111
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

Palace of Love, fellas.</font>

118
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,457

- Yeah.</font>

119
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:58,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vicky, Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fellas!
What's goin' on?</font>

125
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sherman. Not much. Just, uh,
scopin' the babes.</font>

126
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indeed! Some fine ladies here, boys.</font>

127
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,860

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have somethin'
goin' tonight, Sherman?</font>

131
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see that
Central chick, Bernette?</font>

132
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Um, no.
- No.</font>

133
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.</font>

134
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fellas, it's time
she experienced... the Shermanator.</font>

135
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay,
Sherman. Whatever.</font>

I'll be back!</font>

Guys... Guys...</font>

142

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

145

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're right, Kev.
I should just go talk to her.</font>

00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah,
I could do that. Sure.</font>

There's no party.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Party!</font>

163
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weird.
Try the house down the street.</font>

164
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's your major?</font>

165
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,554

Great night, isn't it?</font>

167

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

168
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's just somethin' about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?</font>

169
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the smell
of fresh rain or somethin'.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck me, beautiful.</font>

171
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you just say?</font>

172
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck me, beautiful.</font>

173
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:26,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.</font>

174
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pathetic.</font>

175
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.</font>

176

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, there's just some things
you need to learn, that's all.</font>

177
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.</font>

178
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...</font>

179
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and spout off
cheeseball lines to be romantic.</font>

180
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.</font>

181
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:49,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.</font>

182
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:53,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.</font>

183
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:03,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?</font>

184
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:07,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.</font>

185
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?</font>

186
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, my parts fuckin' stink!</font>

187
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you gotta take
a shit! You smell like a Yeti!</font>

188
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or not.</font>

189
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just relax.</font>

190
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You actually
said that?</font>

191
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!</font>

192
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did a hell of a lot better
than I did with Nadia.</font>

193
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.</font>

194
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, no problem,
'Nova.</font>

195
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't call me 'Nova anymore.
I'm a... I'm a fraud.</font>

196
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys
are pathetic.</font>

197
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.</font>

198
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Suck me, beautiful"!</font>

199
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let me know.
- Okay.</font>

200
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going.</font>

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should be able
to talk to girls.</font>

202
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm articulate.</font>

203
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I got a 720
on my S.A.T. Verbal.</font>

204
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bullshit.
There's no way.</font>

205
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.</font>

206
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:19,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copious. Verisimilitude.</font>

207
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, ohh. Now.</font>

208
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck me,
beautiful!</font>

209
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!</font>

210
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please, vacate the room.
- You are such a jerk.</font>

211
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.</font>

212
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yup.</font>

213
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you got
a keg too!</font>

214
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow!
- Indeed.</font>

215
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.</font>

216
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.
Here, babe!</font>

217
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:13,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

218
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're really
beautiful. Oh...</font>

219
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Oh, yeah.</font>

220
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? I don't know
if I want to be doing this.</font>

221
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:42,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Doing what?
- You know, like, if we hook up tonight,</font>

222
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling all your friends about.</font>

223
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:48,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way!</font>

224
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!</font>

225
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. Sarah,</font>

226
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... I wouldn't go telling
stories or anything about you.</font>

227
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:05,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise.
So, just... relax,</font>

228
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take it slow... and
let the good times roll.</font>

229
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- All right.</font>

230
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?</font>

231
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong?
What is it?</font>

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Xenophobic.</font>

233

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

234
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.</font>

235
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.</font>

236
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?</font>

237
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, h-have you just
never had one with Kevin...</font>

238
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or have you never
had one, period?</font>

239
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had one.</font>

240
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think.
- Okay.</font>

241
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:03,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.</font>

242
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell me you never
even had one manually?</font>

243
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've never tried it.
- You've never double-clicked your mouse?</font>

244
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:11,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha-ha, nice!</font>

245
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus! Stifler, how much
did you drink, man?</font>

246
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:18,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Stifler?
How's the pale ale?</font>

247
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:22,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fuck you!
- Ooh, whoo!</font>

248
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.</font>

249
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.</font>

250
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dude, that chick's a "MILF."
- What the hell is that?</font>

251
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- M-I-L-F... Mom I'd like to fuck.
- Yeah, dude!</font>

252
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh-ho, yeah!</font>

- Sherman, what's goin' on?</font>

255
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,953

could try a little tact?</font>

256
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:57,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got company,
if you know what I mean?</font>

257
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's hot!</font>

258
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:09,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Sherman has sex before I do,
I'm gonna be really pissed.</font>

259
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:14,516

261
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF! MILF!</font>

262
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:25,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF! MILF! Dude, hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?</font>

263
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
bro, dude.</font>

264
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:32,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enough of this blow job bullshit.</font>

265
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:36,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I gotta get laid already.
- That's nice. Really, really nice.</font>

266
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I have a ride?
- Sure.</font>

267
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.</font>

268
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:48,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeti!
I am the Yeti!</font>

269
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good morning, gentlemen.

270
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:03,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where were you last night, huh? What
happened to that foolproof plan of yours?</font>

271
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I was going for a fashionably-late
entrance and I was too late.</font>

272
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:09,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So,
no ladies left.</font>

273
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a very
special night, very special.</font>

274
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys. Guys.</font>

275
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:20,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll never forget this.

277
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:29,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, bye.

00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I... am now a man.</font>

281
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I highly recommend
you join the club.</font>

282
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:48,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were doin' the wild thing...
all night. I'm exhausted.</font>

283
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't get it. I mean,
how the hell did you do that?</font>

284
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:56,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just my time.
It was just my time.</font>

285
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best of luck
to you boys.</font>

286
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.</font>

287
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:08,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we should
be happy for Sherman.</font>

288
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we shouldn't be.</font>

289
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.</font>

290
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:17,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.</font>

291
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is just wrong.
- No shit.</font>

292
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr. Sensitive Man?</font>

293
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?</font>

294
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, they probably have special dorms
for people like us.</font>

295
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:34,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.</font>

296
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.</font>

297
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Er, nah. It's...
It's more than an agreement.</font>

298
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? A bet?
- A pact.</font>

299
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No money involved.
More important than any bet.</font>

300
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:48,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.</font>

301
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:52,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.</font>

302
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about when you work out, Oz.
You gotta have someone there, right?</font>

303
00:18:55,636 --> 00:18:58,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone to spot you.
Someone to keep you motivated.</font>

304
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's exactly what
we can do for each other.</font>

305
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we'll be there
to keep each other on track.</font>

306
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Separately, we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together,</font>

307
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.</font>

00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their tiger-style
kung fu is strong.</font>

309
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:12,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But our dragon-style
will defeat it.</font>

310
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:15,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Guys!
- The Shaolin masters from East and West must unite!</font>

311
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!</font>

312
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:23,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.</font>

313
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must make
a stand, here and now.</font>

314
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:30,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!</font>

315
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:34,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.</font>

316
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our day.
This is our time.</font>

317
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:42,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.</font>

318
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Amen. Yes.
- I like that.</font>

319
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!</font>

320
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We will get laid!
- Yeah! Yeah!</font>

321
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:57,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the sex: It's got
to be valid, consensual sex.</font>

322
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinkin', Finch.</font>

323
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Busted.</font>

324
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, basically,
prom is our last chance.</font>

325
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, dude. Prom sucks.
- I know,</font>

326
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you gotta think
about it this way.</font>

327
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.</font>

328
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:18,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah-yeah, he's right. It's, like tradition or something.
- The Rose Bowl.</font>

329
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, that gives us...
- Exactly 3 weeks to the day.</font>

330
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:28,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're gonna do this.
- All right, to the next step! Next step!</font>

331
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:28,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next step!</font>

00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you need
your balls reattached.</font>

385
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:26,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?</font>

386
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This place
is an untapped resource.</font>

387
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
check it out.</font>

388
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:35,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- These vocal jazz girls are hot.
- Why the hell is he joining jazz choir so late?</font>

389
00:23:35,666 --> 00:23:39,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?</font>

390
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:43,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys,
we don't even know him.</font>

391
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dipshit!</font>

392
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're expecting
to score with some...</font>

393
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goody-goody
choirgirl priss?</font>

394
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:55,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These chicks don't know me. I can work
the sensitive angle here, fellas!</font>

395
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.</font>

396
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that you gotta do
is just ask 'em questions...</font>

397
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:03,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and listen to what
they have to say and shit.</font>

398
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!</font>

399
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, just a second!</font>

400
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come in. Come in.</font>

401
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jim, you're here.</font>

402
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:26,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, I was just walking
by your room and uh...</font>

403
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:30,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...</font>

404
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a little
father-son, uh-uh, chat."</font>

405
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:38,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! I almost forgot.
I, uh, I bought some magazines.</font>

406
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:41,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you just want to flip
to the center section?</font>

407
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is the...
this is the, uh, female form.</font>

408
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they have
focused on the breasts,</font>

409
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:54,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">uh, which are used primarily
to, uh, feed young infants...</font>

410
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:59,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and, uh... and also, uh, in foreplay.
- Right.</font>

411
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:02,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is, uh...
This is Hustler.</font>

412
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:06,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is a much
more exotic magazine.</font>

413
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:11,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, they have decided to focus
on the, uh, pubic region...</font>

414
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:15,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- The whole groin area.</font>

415
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:19,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?</font>

416
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying,</font>

417
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:26,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?"</font>

418
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You see?
- Right.</font>

419
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:34,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with,</font>

420
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:38,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, again,
if you flip to the center...</font>

421
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:41,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Section...</font>

422
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you see the detail that, uh,
that they go into in this picture here.</font>

423
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- It almost looks like a tropical plant or something...</font>

424
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- underwater... thing.
- Yeah. Yes.</font>

425
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.</font>

426
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, don't say, "Oh..."
- Yes, I know what a clitoris is.</font>

427
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:58,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you do. Oh, I see. Yes, you do.
I forgot you've been there and back.</font>

428
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know everything...
- I've learned about it in Sex Ed...</font>

429
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I really don't need you to talk about clitoris.
- I'm trying to make this painless...</font>

430
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:06,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know what? I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
- No-no-no.</font>

431
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:09,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.</font>

432
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shouldn't
have got hot there.</font>

433
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know what
I'm going to do, Jim.</font>

434
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to just
leave these books here...</font>

435
00:26:15,993 --> 00:26:19,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for you to, uh, peruse at your, uh...
at your leisure.</font>

436
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:23,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

437
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, safer
than a tube sock.</font>

438
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:35,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, that... That was good.
- Yeah.</font>

439
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:41,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See you at dinner.
- Uh, yeah. I'll see you at dinner.</font>

440
00:26:41,534 --> 00:26:43,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Finch,
this is your plan?</font>

441
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.</font>

442
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin, I'm sure
that they're not.</font>

443
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:52,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, there is one small matter that
I need to ask for your cooperation in.</font>

444
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:55,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know?
- Sure, what do you need?</font>

445
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.</font>

446
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:02,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I gotta go.
16 minutes round-trip.</font>

447
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:05,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Finch,
it's... it's senior year.</font>

448
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:08,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, don't you think it's time you
learned how to take a dump at school?</font>

449
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:11,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?</font>

450
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

451
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:23,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, that's
Paul Finch, right?</font>

452
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:26,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right?</font>

453
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:31,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, yeah.
- So, my friends, they want to know. Is it true?</font>

454
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
that he's... equipped.</font>

455
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:38,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.</font>

456
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, uh...</font>

457
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:44,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!</font>

458
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.</font>

459
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Thanks.</font>

460
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man!</font>

461
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I was thinking maybe you could
give me some advice, brother to brother.</font>

462
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:01,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you might know a trick
or somethin' to make her...</font>

463
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:05,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Orgasm?
- Yeah. What's good here?</font>

464
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?</font>

465
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you do that?
- Hey, never mind that. Listen, pay attention.</font>

466
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:15,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that all that you're interested in,
tryin' to get your girl into bed?</font>

467
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it'd be good to be able
to, you know, return the favor.</font>

468
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.</font>

469
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:24,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that? That's good. That's what
I wanted to hear. Now, you qualify.</font>

470
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:31,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Qualify for what?
- My man, you've just inherited the Bible.</font>

471
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It originally started
as a sex manual,</font>

472
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:37,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.</font>

473
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And each year it got passed on to one
East student who was worthy.</font>

474
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:43,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.</font>

475
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:51,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.</font>

476
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
So now you know. Good luck.</font>

485
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:35,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

486
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:37,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, sorry.
- No, it was good.</font>

487
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:43,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it, uh...
It came from the heart.</font>

488
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:47,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, keep it coming.
All right, people, good work!</font>

489
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:50,332

490
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:53,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so keep on it, okay?</font>

491
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:06,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad, Chris.</font>

492
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

493
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:11,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, uh,
Heather, right?</font>

494
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

495
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.</font>

496
00:30:16,525 --> 00:30:21,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. I feel like I've
discovered this whole new side of me.</font>

497
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, uh,
music is so expressive.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
I mean, I agree, but...</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">aren't you supposed to be out,

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think
I don't get that?</font>

508
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:58,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...</font>

509
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:03,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that people say, "Oh, look. There's
this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."</font>

510
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:07,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?</font>

511
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,
the same things you do,</font>

512
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:13,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like hang out
with friends and stuff.</font>

513
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:16,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why? What do you think I do?
- Oh, I...</font>

514
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:19,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just realized that I don't
know anything about you.</font>

515
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:24,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was interested.
- Oh, well, what do you want to know?</font>

516
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
stuff... about you.</font>

517
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

518
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:37,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom, I'm home!</font>

519
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. Oh!</font>

520
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:43,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jim!
- It's not what it looks like.</font>

521
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we'll just tell your
mother that, uh... that, uh...</font>

522
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we ate it all.</font>

523

524
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,148

- Nice game. Good game.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what are
you doin' here?</font>

526
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.</font>

527
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.</font>

528
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:59,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Um, Chris...
- Oh, you can call me Oz, if you want.</font>

529
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do I have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.</font>

530
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's your middle name?
- Nah, forget it.</font>

531
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on. I won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will I.</font>

532
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:11,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Um.</font>

533
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I had this thought and...</font>

534
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:17,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It may seem like
it's way out of left field.</font>

535
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:21,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you can, but since I'm not
going with anybody, I thought that maybe...</font>

536
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:24,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those guys sucked ass!</font>

537
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?</font>

538
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:31,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, uh, I was
asking Chris to prom.</font>

539
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:33,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, do you
want to go?</font>

540
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:37,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah!
That would be great.</font>

541
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:40,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, just don't
expect Oz to pay for the limo!</font>

542
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:43,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler, fuck!
I mean...</font>

543
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:48,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you got to be so
insensitive all the time?</font>

544
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

545
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:55,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever. Look, uh, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.</font>

546
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On Lake Michigan.</font>

547
00:34:57,723 --> 00:35:00,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, wait up, you pussies.
Where you goin'?</font>

548
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:05,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, well, I gotta...
I gotta hit the showers now,</font>

549
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:09,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think this is gonna
be really, really good.</font>

550
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:13,071

those cute little sweaters she wears.</font>

559
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.</font>

560
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:57,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a... I'm a total idiot.
I mean, a fool, a buffoon.</font>

shithead, and I want to make it up to you.</font>

565
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? How?</font>

at the old family portrait out here.</font>

577
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:02,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?</font>

578
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:05,184
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

579
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:09,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.</font>

580
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:14,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I just want you to know that
it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing.</font>

581
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I have
to admit, uh, you know.</font>

582
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:20,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.</font>

583
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:25,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh... I used to call it
"stroking the salami."</font>

584
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you know,
"pounding the ol' pud."</font>

585
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:30,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never did it
with baked goods.</font>

586
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:35,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you know your Uncle Mort? He "pinched
the one-eyed snake" 5, 6 times a day.</font>

587
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, it's like, uh,
practice for the big game.</font>

588
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:42,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see?
It's like... It's like...</font>

589
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:45,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.</font>

590
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:49,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.</font>

591
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right. No.
- It's not a game.</font>

592
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.</font>

593
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner.</font>

594
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You do want a partner?
- Oh, I want a partner.</font>

595
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:05,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Want a partner. Good. Good.
- Of course.</font>

596
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

597
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:12,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...</font>

598
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:14,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...</font>

599
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.</font>

600
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:21,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Hal is going through a...
rite of passage, much like you all are.</font>

601
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:25,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.</font>

602
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, does your tongue cramp up?</font>

603
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:32,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.</font>

604
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:36,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.</font>

605
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:41,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Class dismissed.</font>

606
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:48,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still questing after the Holy Grail,
huh, guys?</font>

607
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:54,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh,
where's Finch?</font>

608
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, he went home to take a shit.</font>

609
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't get it.
I just don't.</font>

610
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?</font>

611
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What reputation?
- Observe.</font>

612
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ex-Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?</font>

613
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:12,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?</font>

614
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:18,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.</font>

615
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:22,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, um, if you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?</font>

616
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>

617
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:28,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Explain.</font>

618
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't. I don't
know how he's doing it.</font>

619
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:35,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh... I guess that
just leaves Jim trailing.</font>

620
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Aw, Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!</font>

621
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it, all right?</font>

622
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">James?</font>

623
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are very good
in the world history class, yes?</font>

624
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? Y-Yes. No, uh...</font>

625
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, I am.
- Perhaps you could help me with my studies.</font>

626
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah. Absolutely.</font>

627
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tha-Tha-Tha... That would be...
That would be great sometime.</font>

628
00:39:55,812 --> 00:40:00,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practice.</font>

629
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:03,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards?</font>

630
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could change
clothes at your place.</font>

631
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:11,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Uh... yeah.</font>

632
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:15,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suppose that

take out that chair.</font>

774
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:26,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yup, he took out the chair.

till she leaves.</font>

801
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:58,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very arousing women.
They arouse me...</font>

802
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They arouse me
very, very much.</font>

803
00:52:00,746 --> 00:52:04,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, uh...
But not as arousing as you.</font>

804
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, Jim!
- Oh, God!</font>

- Is that possible?</font>

815
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a loser.</font>

816
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:53,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a loser.</font>

817
00:52:57,135 --> 00:52:58,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

818

and thank you, baby </i></font>

823
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:44,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, minute man!
- Shut up.</font>

824
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:46,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know... You know you're
supposed to be supportive.</font>

825
00:53:46,643 --> 00:53:50,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you think you still
got a chance with Nadia?</font>

826
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:54,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Her sponsors here
saw the thing on the 'Net.</font>

827
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I really don't
think they liked it.</font>

828
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:58,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do
you know that?</font>

829
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:00,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's already on a plane back home.</font>

830
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:02,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

831
00:54:02,659 --> 00:54:06,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, guys? Maybe I'm just
not good with girls, period.</font>

832
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:10,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No-no-no, really-really. Like... Like I
was born without that part of the brain.</font>

833
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I can't
talk to girls.</font>

834
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:14,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when I do talk
to them, I screw it up.</font>

835
00:54:14,463 --> 00:54:17,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, come prom those excuses
aren't going to do you any good.</font>

836
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:23,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And one time at band camp,</font>

837
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we weren't supposed
to have pillow fights,</font>

838
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.</font>

839
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:33,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A... And this one time, we all lost our music
and we were supposed to play this song,</font>

840
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:38,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we didn't know it, so we just made
it up and we kept playing and playing,</font>

841
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:42,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the conductor didn't know
what we were doing, and it was so funny.</font>

842
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:45,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you're pissed about somethin', huh.</font>

843
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what
I do when I'm angry?</font>

844
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:50,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.</font>

845
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I learned to do that at band camp.
- Hold on, uh...</font>

846
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:57,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea
why I'm angry?</font>

847
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
Sometimes I get cranky...</font>

848
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:03,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I know I have
a big test to study for.</font>

849
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:08,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- I thought so...</font>

850
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:11,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- because this one time at band camp...
- W-What's your name?</font>

851
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Michelle.
- O-Okay.</font>

852
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:15,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michelle, um...</font>

853
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:17,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to be
my date for the prom?</font>

854
00:55:18,026 --> 00:55:21,405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? You seriously
want to go with me?</font>

855
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:28,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Seriously.</font>

856
00:55:28,203 --> 00:55:31,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we going to Steve Stifler's party
afterwards? Because that would be so cool.</font>

857
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:37,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sure, whatever you want.
- Cool! We're gonna have such a good time.</font>

858
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:42,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be like this one time at band camp
when we all had a campfire...</font>

859
00:55:57,191 --> 00:56:00,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

860
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How'd you know I was here?
- Stifler told me.</font>

861
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:07,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Talked to Stifler?
- Well, I needed to find you.</font>

862
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:09,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have
to work on that song.</font>

863
00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:13,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
I'm glad you came by.</font>

864
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:16,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you work nights?</font>

865
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:21,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My dad's the manager.
- Really?</font>

866
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:24,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.</font>

867
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:29,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So you're going to Michigan next year?
- Yeah.</font>

868
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...</font>

869
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:35,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna write all those
extra essays they make you do.</font>

870
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:40,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, how am I supposed to know what my
"most emotionally significant moment" was?</font>

871
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:45,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So when my "U" of "M" acceptance came in
December, I just said the hell with it.</font>

872
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Onions?
- What?</font>

873
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, uh, want onions?</font>

874
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:52,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, thank you.</font>

875
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what are you
gonna major in?</font>

876
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:01,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">State's got a good business school, and I
could probably walk-on to the lacrosse team.</font>

877
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you've probably got it
pretty figured out, then, huh?</font>

878
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:09,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but...</font>

879
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:12,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what am I gonna be,
a professional lacrosse player?</font>

880
00:57:12,683 --> 00:57:14,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really have no idea.</font>

881
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:18,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.</font>

882
00:57:18,147 --> 00:57:20,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you're not.</font>

883
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:23,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we're gonna be
close next year.</font>

884
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor?</font>

885
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:36,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

886
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:38,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you
talkin' about?</font>

887
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.</font>

888
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:45,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.</font>

889
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:49,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's a long shot, but I figure
Paul Finch might ask me.</font>

890
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:53,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch.
Shit-brick.</font>

891
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, gosh.
I-I forgot.</font>

892
00:57:56,602 --> 00:57:59,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look okay.</font>

893
00:57:59,104 --> 00:58:02,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I mean, the scars
healed really well.</font>

894
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.</font>

895
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:09,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that
all about?</font>

896
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that?</font>

897
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:16,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean,
"no comment"?</font>

898
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:19,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you two hook up or something?
- What, are you kidding? No.</font>

899
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:22,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then how did all this
get started?</font>

900
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:26,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.</font>

901
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:29,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That reputation of his isn't
going anywhere. Cheese, please.</font>

902
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch comes up to me
and says, "Jessica,</font>

903
00:58:32,554 --> 00:58:35,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera."</font>

904
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:37,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks,</font>

905
00:58:37,684 --> 00:58:40,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed."</font>

906
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he did,
and I did.</font>

907
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That actually works?
- Well, duh! Of course.</font>

908
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:48,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naturally, I embellished
a little bit.</font>

909
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:50,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman?</font>

910
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I didn't hear that one.</font>

911
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:55,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one was my favorite.</font>

912
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:57,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do that cheerleader.</font>

913
00:58:57,538 --> 00:59:01,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i> Thank you, baby </i>
- She wants me. She calls me up...</font>

914
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:05,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> How sweet it is
to be loved by you </i></font>

915
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:08,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
you're gay!</font>

916
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:10,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sing it with me.
You know the words.</font>

917
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:14,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, thanks, man. You've been
singin' that shit all week.</font>

918
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:17,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you try that at M.S.U.
This Saturday, I'll kick your ass.</font>

919
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our last game
is this Saturday.</font>

920
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:22,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, shit.</font>

921
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:29,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got this lacrosse game. It's
really important. It's our last game.</font>

922
00:59:29,194 --> 00:59:32,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Central almost beat us last time, so
this time I really wanna kick their ass.</font>

923
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's gonna be cool,
because the game's at State,</font>

924
00:59:35,868 --> 00:59:38,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means afterwards
I'll be able to stop by.</font>

925
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:40,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you can't sing
at the competition.</font>

926
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:43,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.</font>

927
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:48,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. You should...
do what makes you happy.</font>

928
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:53,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Listen,
thanks for understanding.</font>

929
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

930
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:59,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, uh, I guess
I'll see you later?</font>

931
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:17,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kevin.</font>

932
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:22,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You seen shit-brick lately?
- Why? What did you do to him?</font>

933
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:24,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me? Nothing.</font>

934
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:26,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I'm the one
whose ass he kicked.</font>

935
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:30,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, uh, I'll tell you
one thing, though.</font>

936
01:00:30,297 --> 01:00:33,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think he's gonna have a problem
shitting in school anymore.</font>

937
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:35,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slipped a little something
into his mochaccino.</font>

938
01:00:38,055 --> 01:00:40,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

939
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:43,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Oh!</font>

940

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

941
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:55,030

sir.</font>

942
01:01:00,452 --> 01:01:04,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

943
01:01:32,192 --> 01:01:35,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

944
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be fun.</font>

945
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it's just gonna be
some crappy band and stupid decorations.</font>

946
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:44,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just saying that because prom's
a week away and you don't have a date.</font>

947
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:46,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
I don't want a date.</font>

948
01:01:46,665 --> 01:01:51,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch is goin' stag and... so am I.</font>

949
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:54,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, he's like so...
refined.</font>

950
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:57,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think that
older woman thing is true?</font>

951
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:01,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's true.
It was Stifler's mom.</font>

952
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:06,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joanie, was that you?</font>

953
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:08,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh!
- Can't hold it.</font>

954
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:11,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:48,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kev?
I think we've come...</font>

958
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- a really long way since homecoming.
- Yeah, we have.</font>

959
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's time...</font>

960
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:57,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we start to express ourselves
in new ways.</font>

961
01:02:57,778 --> 01:03:00,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- You wanna do it?</font>

962
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:02,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- I love you.</font>

963

964
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:10,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not
what I was thinking.</font>

965
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:14,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sex. It's always
about sex.</font>

966
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not
always about sex.</font>

967
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:21,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just thought it was
about sex this time.</font>

968
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:28,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Vicky, love is a term
that gets thrown around,</font>

969
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and-and people
don't mean it.</font>

970
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:34,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I say it, I want it
to be more than words.</font>

971
01:03:34,273 --> 01:03:37,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know? I want it to be...

01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:41,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.</font>

1143
01:15:13,806 --> 01:15:18,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for your time.</font>

1144
01:15:30,572 --> 01:15:33,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Guess what?
- Not interested.</font>

1145
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:38,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin. Come on, man. The bus
to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.</font>

1146
01:15:38,288 --> 01:15:40,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not going.
- What?</font>

1147
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:43,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

1148
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:48,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, things didn't really
turn out how I wanted them to.</font>

1149
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:51,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doin'.</font>

1150
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:54,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I-I'm acting like I've got
everything together tonight.</font>

1151
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:58,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that Vicky's gonna
ask me if I love her, and...</font>

1152
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:00,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
what I'm gonna say.</font>

1153
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:02,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
I'm on the brink.</font>

1154
01:16:02,437 --> 01:16:06,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.</font>

1155
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:10,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am just scared.</font>

1156
01:16:10,279 --> 01:16:14,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.</font>

1157
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:17,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We-We are finally going
to a post-prom party on the lake.</font>

1158
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have been waiting for this
for 4 years.</font>

1159
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right?</font>

1160
01:16:24,126 --> 01:16:26,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were friends
with Stifler?</font>

1161
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:28,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look.</font>

1162
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:32,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sherman didn't even
get laid.</font>

1163
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:35,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He didn't?
- No, he pissed himself.</font>

1164
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1165
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:41,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll tell you
on the bus.</font>

1166
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:44,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go inside
and grab my bag.</font>

1167
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:47,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My date too, perhaps?</font>

1168
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler's mom
got it in the divorce.</font>

1169
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:52,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That reminds me
of this one time...</font>

1170
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:55,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, can I ask you
a question?</font>

1171
01:16:56,074 --> 01:16:58,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come you don't have any stories?
I've got lots of them,</font>

1172
01:16:58,785 --> 01:17:01,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you don't have any.</font>

1173
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:04,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I've got stories.
Believe me. They're just, uh...</font>

1174
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just a little
more risque than tales of band camp.</font>

1175
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:11,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!</font>

1176
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
You want a story?</font>

1177
01:17:13,842 --> 01:17:16,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer...</font>

1178
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:23,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is the nicest room in the house.
- Kev, it's perfect.</font>

1179
01:17:34,696 --> 01:17:38,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are gonna fuck, aren't ya?</font>

1180
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:41,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!</font>

1181
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:43,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuckers,
fuckers, fuckers!</font>

1182
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Out.
- Aw, come on!</font>

1183
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:49,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out.
- Aw, man!</font>

1184
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something
I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.</font>

1185
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:12,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>

1186
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:14,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna sound
really bad, but, uh,</font>

1187
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to know.</font>

1188
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:20,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, uh,</font>

1189
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:24,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a virgin,
and, uh...</font>

1190
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:27,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, me, Kevin, Jim
and Finch were...</font>

1191
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:30,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all made this pact...</font>

1192
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:33,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that we would
lose our virginity...</font>

1193
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:35,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before high school
was over,</font>

1194
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:38,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tonight is supposed
to be the night that we all do it.</font>

1195
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:42,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't the best way
to proposition me.</font>

1196
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:45,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's...
That's not what I mean.</font>

1197
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:48,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">W- What I mean is, uh...</font>

1198
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, do you know
what made me leave that game?</font>

1199
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, Coach, he was givin' us
this speech about...</font>

1200
01:18:55,527 --> 01:18:58,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score...</font>

1201
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:00,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't any better,
Chris.</font>

1202
01:19:00,449 --> 01:19:02,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you see...
You see, Heather,</font>

1203
01:19:02,618 --> 01:19:05,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I realized is that...</font>

1204
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:10,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with you, it's...
not like I'm running towards a goal...</font>

1205
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:13,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">looking for
the best way to score.</font>

1206
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:17,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This may sound
a little corny, but...</font>

1207
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like
I've already won.</font>

1208
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:26,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, uh,
I care about you a lot.</font>

1209
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oz, I know.</font>

1210
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:34,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.</font>

1211
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:36,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what your friends
call you.</font>

1212
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I feel like I'm
one of your friends now.</font>

1213
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:43,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And... your girlfriend?</font>

1214
01:19:45,494 --> 01:19:49,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> Ain't never thought that
I could love like this </i></font>

1215
01:19:50,082 --> 01:19:53,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> This feeling inside me
is growing </i></font>

1216
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:57,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i> I never thought that
you would care </i></font>

1217
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:18,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are ya lost?</font>

1218
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Stifler's mom.
Uh...</font>

1219
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:29,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, not lost.
Just, um,</font>

1220
01:20:29,204 --> 01:20:31,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know,
taking the tour.</font>

1221
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:37,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, uh, thank you for letting
us have this wonderful party.</font>

1222
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:40,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As if there was
an alternative in the matter.</font>

1223
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you enjoying yourself?</font>

1224
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:51,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.</font>

1225
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so happy for you.</font>

1226
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:55,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it?</font>

1227
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:01,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's your little date tonight?
- No date. It was...</font>

1228
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:03,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a bathroom incident.</font>

1229
01:21:03,572 --> 01:21:08,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pardon me?
- Never mind.</font>

1230
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have
anything to drink?</font>

1231
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:16,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe the kegs
are upstairs.</font>

1232
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:20,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is what
the cretins drink.</font>

1233
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:22,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm talking about
alcohol, liquor.</font>

1234
01:21:22,424 --> 01:21:25,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The good stuff.
- All right.</font>

1235
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got some scotch.</font>

1236
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:33,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Single malt?
- Aged 18 years.</i></font>

1237
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The way I like it.</font>

1238
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:41,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you go
grab a glass from the bar?</font>

1239
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:46,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I should.</font>

1240
01:21:46,824 --> 01:21:48,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me.</font>

1241
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it's
a bitchin' party.</font>

1242
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Stif-man
always comes through in the clutch.</font>

1243
01:21:58,377 --> 01:22:01,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then he just
puked his brains out.</font>

1244
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:04,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, I told you.</font>

1245
01:22:04,883 --> 01:22:07,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to hear
a nasty story of mine?</font>

1246
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:09,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's sort of sexual.</font>

1247
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:13,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!
Yeah, let's hear it.</font>

1248
01:22:13,767 --> 01:22:18,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, this one time at band camp,
we were playing this game.</font>

1249
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:22,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you know it,
but it's called "Spin the Bottle."</font>

1250
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:26,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.</font>

1251
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:28,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And-And he plays
trombone...</font>

1252
01:22:28,365 --> 01:22:30,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how do you
want to be?</font>

1253
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:33,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like... how do you
want to do it?</font>

1254
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
How do you?</font>

1255
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:42,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like... normal style.
The missionary position.</font>

1256
01:22:44,298 --> 01:22:46,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1257
01:22:52,473 --> 01:22:54,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kev?</font>

1258
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:56,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- I wanna hear you say it.</font>

1259
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:59,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1260
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:04,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Victoria,</font>
