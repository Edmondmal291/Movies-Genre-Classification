1
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:40,115
That was a long one. I don't suppose you can tell me how
it looks, can you? Unfortunately, I'm just the technician.

2
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:50,530
Your doctor will have results tomorrow. Would you like
some help too? Thank you very much. You're very good.

3
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:33,132
Yes, why do you call it? Does anyone else? Henry
Kessler? Please. Stage 4, kind of grey. Come on. That's

4
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:52,280
what they tell me anyway. What else like this to me
at? How much time do I have? Do you? Months. At best.

5
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:02,483
I still have a lot of work that needs to be
done. My advice? Retire? You know, at this stage,

6
00:03:02,495 --> 00:03:12,360
everyone always searches for, only out. But sometimes
those who accept their fate have an easier time.

7
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:23,780
How is your time? What? Dying.
So your advice to me is to die easy.

8
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,500
Help! Hey! Help! Help!

9
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,498
I'd like to play a game.
Brown's a number of

10
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,860
dresses, clothes,
sticky fingers of yours.

11
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,452
I've had my eyes on you, and I do not like
what I see. Your job as a custodian is a

12
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:15,340
number one, sanitizing and sterilizing the
hospital, helping patients with white sickness.

13
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,621
There is a sin inside you that
needs to be inside. You have

14
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:25,360
the ability to not only save
your soul today, but your sight.

15
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,591
All you have to do is hook
the dial across the fire positions,

16
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:36,040
and you will live to see another
day. You have 60 seconds.

17
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
Help me!

18
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:19,760
I can't! I can't!
I can't! I can't! I can't!

19
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,990
Not you!

20
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,110
Hey!

21
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:46,780
Can I get a blueberry scone, please?

22
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,110
Thank you.

23
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,020
Henry, we were on the same cancer
support group. John Kramer, I remember you.

24
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,480
Hey, good to see you.

25
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,390
And you as well.

26
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,920
You look marvelous.
Thank you. I feel great.

27
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,220
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
you were in stage four pancreatic.

28
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,340
But now, four months later,
I mean complete remission.

29
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:44,880
It's a long story. I'd love to hear it.
You got a minute to tell me.

30
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:52,560
Sure. Sure.

31
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,011
So, I read about a
doctor, a specialist, a

32
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:03,420
doctor, a skin Peterson.
He offered a treatment.

33
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:18,160
It is a groundbreaking drug cocktail
combined with surgery. It's my wound.

34
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,720
I know it looks bad,
but it was totally worth it.

35
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,450
Yeah.

36
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,400
Is it available here?

37
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:36,880
No. No, no. The treatment's not available.

38
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,820
In the states, the medication
isn't approved by the FDA.

39
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,680
Tell it, it isn't approved by anybody.

40
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,340
I haven't seen them since
my treatment in Norway.

41
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,600
But this link is still good.

42
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
Hey, John.

43
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,480
Good luck, man. Okay?
I am. I'm rooting for you.

44
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Thank you.

45
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Take care.

46
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:40,890
Doctor, what exactly is the procedure?

47
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:46,310
Well, I'm the device circumstances,
and I'm a stimuli. Genus can be turned off.

48
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,850
Turned off. Make a note switch.

49
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,310
And you're targeting the cancer cells.

50
00:10:50,311 --> 00:10:54,592
Exactly. What you managed to do
is to create a new cutting-edge drug

51
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:59,150
cocktail, along with virtually to
teach the malignant cells. Switch off.

52
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:11,210
My father, Dr. Finn Peterson,
was forced into hiding by

53
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:23,690
corrupt governments and their
relationship to big fun. Why?

54
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,622
Because my father was
on the cusp of curing dozens

55
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:32,210
of diseases, which means
no more need for life.

56
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,890
From medication, can you
imagine what that implies?

57
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:41,352
Well, the big drug
company certainly can. And

58
00:11:41,364 --> 00:11:44,110
I'm here to say that
this just cannot stand.

59
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:48,930
So why do my father continues to
make further improvements to his formula?

60
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,226
I'm taking his treatment
on the road for more

61
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:56,710
trials to save as many
lives as humanly possible.

62
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,350
How is this?

63
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,490
This is Celia Peterson.
This is John Kramer.

64
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,570
Yes, it is.

65
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,213
Good. We received the
email with your medical

66
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:44,110
records, Mr. Kramer.
Thank you for reaching out.

67
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,590
I'm sick to three potential
candidates for our program.

68
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,228
So I'm pulling you now
because we have stopped

69
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,020
opening the treatment
in about three months.

70
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,180
Mr. Kramer?

71
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,480
Uh, he has a leader.

72
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,990
You don't have three months, do you?

73
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,294
Okay, listen. I am
currently working in

74
00:13:09,306 --> 00:13:12,520
Mexico, also has
become too difficult for us.

75
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,020
But we have a team of specialists here who
share our belief in the Peterson method,

76
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,580
and I've gathered a group of eligible
patients who start treatment a week from now.

77
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,800
I think I could add one more
spot, if you are interested.

78
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes, I'm interested.
Henry Kessler, referring me to you.

79
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,560
Henry, he's doing well. I'm so pleased.

80
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,500
I wonder if you could tell me a
little more about the treatment?

81
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,729
Of course. It's a
two-pronged treatment that

82
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,060
uses my father's
sexual phenol cocktail,

83
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,200
and in your case it would be combined
with a cranial surgery to clear the tumor.

84
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,040
When both are used together,
the results have been stunning.

85
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,820
Or a 90% success rate.
I know it's an old trip.

86
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,140
Mr. Kramer, especially in your condition.

87
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:05,841
But I want you to know
that we've found a very

88
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:08,540
beautiful location for our
clinic outside Mexico City.

89
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,805
It's in a well-of-the-grid
area in the

90
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,800
countryside where you
can have safety and privacy.

91
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,750
Also, of course, it's the range for
a trusted driver that you're arriving.

92
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,580
What date did you have in mind?

93
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,180
Fifth, right after next.

94
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,180
I think I could make that.

95
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:44,950
Yes? Yes.

96
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,530
Welcome to Mexico. Please. This way.

97
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,810
Take a look at that.

98
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,910
That's a much holy can cathedral.

99
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,490
That's too better from
a wish home memorial.

100
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,410
That's the angel of independence.
Take a look at that.

101
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,990
It's really beautiful.

102
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,370
So, hey, hey, that's my friend.

103
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,030
That's the old Aztec statue of flowers.

104
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,082
That's where the priests
chomped the hearts out

105
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:21,090
of their subjects and
pulled them downstairs.

106
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,890
Every day a tourist wants
me to take them here.

107
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:26,891
There he is.

108
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,650
Hey, Jay.

109
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,110
Okay?

110
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:02,900
You're listening to me.I
can't. I can't. My name. Tell.

111
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,100
your name? John Kramer.

112
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,940
Like to me again. I
left you this chamber in

113
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:14,380
July. I'm not lying, my
name is John Kramer.

114
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:26,000
You're fine. You're safe. Come with me.
Come, come. Here. Welcome. Watch your head.

115
00:16:51,780 --> 00:17:00,680
You're room. Here. Come.
Sit here. Good luck.

116
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,310
See?

117
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,510
I am John Kramer.

118
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,070
Come. There you go.

119
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,540
Hi, Gabriela.

120
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,700
There you go.

121
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Meet my family.

122
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,600
Come.

123
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:44,601
Hello.

124
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Hello.

125
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,140
I came back in here.

126
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,060
Doctor Cecilia Peterson.

127
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
I came.

128
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,720
She saved life.

129
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
My life.

130
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,260
I came. I came now.

131
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Mr. Kramer.

132
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:24,900
Welcome.

133
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:25,901
Welcome.

134
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,150
That was quite a reception.
Did I go out on the way out here?

135
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,768
Oh, well, welcome.
I know. I'm sorry, but

136
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,370
we've had to beef up
the security where we go.

137
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,170
The big drug companies
are always one step behind.

138
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,370
So, we must keep our location
secret from everyone, leaving you.

139
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,850
Come. I want you to meet the team.

140
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,460
Hello.

141
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Yes?

142
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
That's Carlos.

143
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,940
Our local football star.

144
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,720
His father, he's a kid, take it.

145
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Love it.

146
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Really?

147
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,300
This used to be a chemical
factory up in the day.

148
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,110
Hello, Doctor.

149
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,350
Is this Joe Kramer?

150
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,250
Very nice to meet you, Mr. Kramer,
and welcome to our clinic.

151
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,910
You're a very good hat for us.

152
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,510
I tell you, it isn't anesthesiologist
at hospital after Prado.

153
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,910
He is a residency at Tom's Health Kingston.
That's where you'll look with my father.

154
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:34,730
Yes.

155
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,070
We'll be helping out with
your surgery tomorrow.

156
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,630
Thank you.

157
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,090
I'll be right here, being here.

158
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,310
Thank you.

159
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,840
This is Valentina, one of our nurses.

160
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,220
She will be taking some
scans and drawing some blood.

161
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,020
All in preparation for that
injection therapy later today.

162
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,940
Mr. Sierz, we're good.

163
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
It's good for release.

164
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,780
Dr. Silly?

165
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
John Kramer?

166
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,400
Thorough cancer, advanced in brain.

167
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
You win.

168
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Sorry, I'm here.

169
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Call me home yesterday.

170
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,040
I took out a tumor the size of my dog.

171
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,420
I just had to stop the hotel.

172
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
You did it in natural killer cells.

173
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,600
There were a type of cytotoxic
lymphocytes developed by my father.

174
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,100
Good luck, John.

175
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Thank you.

176
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
John, where are you?

177
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,460
Please don't worry.

178
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,010
So, Mr. Kramer, what do you do?

179
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,790
Like for a living?

180
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:10,930
John.

181
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,250
Please call me John.

182
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,340
And what do you do, John?

183
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,310
I've done a civil engineer at an architect.

184
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:18,710
Most of my life.

185
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:23,610
Now I have a few hobbies.

186
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Let me get it.

187
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
Classic drug renovation.

188
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
No?

189
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
No.

190
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,040
I hope people will
overcome inner obstacles.

191
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,160
Help them make positive
changes in their lives.

192
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,900
Like life coach, yes?

193
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,410
Something like that.

194
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,020
Sounds not.

195
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,790
I don't think of anything more
important than helping others.

196
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,940
Yeah.

197
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Thank you.

198
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,980
Very good, though.

199
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,920
Thank you, Gabriel.

200
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
No.

201
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,460
It's a local favorite.

202
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,120
You can't drink another,
not people's surgery.

203
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,220
My son says to rise again.

204
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:21,221
Yeah.

205
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,620
Your son is rising again, John.

206
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
We will make sure of it.

207
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,260
You speak English, Carlos?

208
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,220
Yeah?

209
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,800
That's about as good as my Spanish.

210
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,200
How do you say it, Paul?

211
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,200
Paul, Paul, Paul.

212
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,201
Hello.

213
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,440
Hello.

214
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,590
Excellent.

215
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,230
Hello.

216
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,440
Thank you.

217
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,160
I hope it forms the surgery.

218
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,300
Dr. Ruben Cortes, also a doctor of Prado.

219
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,780
He's the best you research in 2000 miles.

220
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,540
He's the doctor I have to use if
my own family was on the table.

221
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,180
Now, we'll be performing
an awake traniotomy.

222
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,980
This means that you'll
be floating in and out of

223
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,400
consciousness, so that
we can function like this.

224
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,580
It allows us to monitor your abilities, so
that we don't touch any part of your brain.

225
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
You did great.

226
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Where are we?

227
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
We're two blocks away
from a Theo's hospital.

228
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,880
In case you need a transfusion.

229
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,740
That you have not worked.

230
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,720
Even though global is normal.

231
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
It all looks good, John.

232
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,290
It all looks good.

233
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:54,330
Now, drink two day.

234
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,090
One in the morning and one at night.

235
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,890
Okay.

236
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,410
In addition to my father's treatment,

237
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,910
it contains a painkiller you'll
need for the next seven days.

238
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,610
After that, what happens then?

239
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,030
You're a live puppet, isn't it?

240
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,800
I don't know, Ches, but I've got real life.

241
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Where are you the oldest?

242
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
I'll send them your best.

243
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Don't get your head wet.

244
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,140
The advantage is hand type by two.

245
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,500
It will stay out in place.

246
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,320
An antenna will swing by
to keep an eye on it for you.

247
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,040
There's some rest in our job.

248
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,140
All right.

249
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,560
Dr. Fusen, just so you know her.

250
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,180
I'll wear her the second half.

251
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I have it to one more.

252
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Thank you, John.

253
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Have a good night, John.

254
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,140
A long, good night.

255
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
It's for a friend.

256
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Hello?

257
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,630
Hello?

258
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:10,030
Good night.

259
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:25,940
Okay, so, here we are,
this is the flow of statue,

260
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:26,941
okay, hello, what an
entrance, all in the house.

261
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,900
Out in the air, no.

262
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:33,012
I'd like to play a
game, attached to your

263
00:35:33,024 --> 00:36:07,720
arms or two explosive
devices, pipe the bombs.

264
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,428
Cancer, a malignancy
that must be cut out for

265
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,480
you to survive, the
blades cannot cut through

266
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:23,028
the galvanized cable,
with the Cannon spliced

267
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,360
through the flesh and muscle allowing
you to cut the cancer away with or die.

268
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
A tweeze.

269
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
Cramer.

270
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,940
Cramer.

271
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
Cramer.

272
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Cramer.

273
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,840
Cramer.

274
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,220
Cramer.

275
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Cramer.

276
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,990
Cramer.

277
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,640
Cramer.

278
00:38:45,770 --> 00:39:45,240
I can use your assistance in locating some
people that are in need of our services.

279
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:34,773
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

280
00:41:34,785 --> 00:42:11,490
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:42:11,790 --> 00:44:40,660
no, no, no, no, no, no,

282
00:44:43,660 --> 00:45:00,376
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

283
00:45:00,388 --> 00:45:17,040
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

284
00:45:17,140 --> 00:46:02,367
You said those medical records
in and we'll have a look, alright?

285
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:45,530
Perfect. See you soon Margaret.
See you soon. Oh, get it gone.

286
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,180
This is my sensory show, Amanda.

287
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,690
Celia.

288
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,410
you're going to fucking me.

289
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:22,930
who are you?

290
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:23,750
please.

291
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,691
please please
please please please.

292
00:49:32,240 --> 00:50:02,870
why don't you try to help him.

293
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,510
that game is over.

294
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Valentina.

295
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,260
didn't let blood ever make into the lab.

296
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,020
or.

297
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,180
could you just suck it out and
flush it down the drain somewhere.

298
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,240
we have nothing to do
with this we get her own, it's

299
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:34,760
going on and we'll solve her
She's glad the whole thing.

300
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,290
No, Taylor.

301
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:39,286
I don't even know if that's your real name.

302
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,540
It is my real name.

303
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,300
It is.

304
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,600
Oh.

305
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,180
I say you've never heard of you.

306
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,680
That's a hostel.

307
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,720
She told me to say that I
worked there for tonight.

308
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:50,980
Wait.

309
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,480
Wait.

310
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:52,580
Wait.

311
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,160
Wait.

312
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:53,460
Wait.

313
00:50:53,461 --> 00:50:54,461
Mr. Kramer.

314
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,280
I meant them hard.

315
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:01,260
I would really like to believe you.

316
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:03,860
Gabrielle.

317
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,460
You'll have a chance to prove yourself.

318
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,340
The kid of your freedom is inside that box.

319
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:33,790
It's a jelly saw.

320
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,150
I thought you said there was a kid.

321
00:51:37,151 --> 00:51:39,010
He was speaking metaphorically.

322
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:40,890
He does that a lot.

323
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,030
When I get out of here,

324
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,330
I'm going to kill both of them.

325
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:47,630
You want to fuck them?

326
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:51,730
That's a good plan.

327
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,130
You're going to want
to really listen carefully

328
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:56,710
to the rules in
order to pull that off.

329
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,650
Fuck you.

330
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,170
Go ahead.

331
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:29,360
The wire saw inside that box was invented
by an Italian physician, Leonardo, Julie.

332
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:33,600
It creates an extraordinarily
clean cut along.

333
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,620
The dotted line on your leg marks the spot.

334
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,920
Are you fucking Christian?

335
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,360
What means you think I
fucking get off my own leg?

336
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,440
Well, because if you don't,

337
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,480
the wire saw that's
wrapped around your neck.

338
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,140
will first cut into your
skin and your verbal

339
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:16,520
ligaments and finally
it'll sever your spinal cord.

340
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,400
A cleft-on's version?

341
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,270
You're right.

342
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,830
It's true.

343
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,090
We won't.

344
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:37,940
The Valentina, Mike.

345
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,440
All of you.

346
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,400
All of you.

347
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,160
All of you.

348
00:53:53,435 --> 00:53:55,120
We promise dying people.

349
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,480
Dying people!

350
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:08,150
You could save their lives
and then doing so of you took

351
00:54:08,151 --> 00:54:12,200
advantage of the only
thing that they still possess.

352
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,060
Oh.

353
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,010
No, don't.

354
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,140
We've worked to heal people.

355
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,940
Your case was...

356
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,980
different.

357
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,060
Then still you lie.

358
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,620
My associate Amanda here has
titled Look at your bank records.

359
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,860
Pickle up.

360
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,390
Who are those 34 people to you?

361
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,190
John's case was different.

362
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,990
Did you heal any of those 34 people?

363
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,410
Do they have children,

364
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,890
but they're now orphaned?

365
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:55,870
Even though this Larsen stands now
for more than the years, eight years.

366
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,601
That's one eight million dollars.

367
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,470
There's a lot of pain.

368
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:06,910
to inflict on others for
your own enrichment.

369
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,190
There was no healing going on their beds.

370
00:55:10,191 --> 00:55:11,370
They're all underground.

371
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,310
I checked.

372
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:14,590
We know everything.

373
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:16,470
We have everything.

374
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,330
Including the cash from your house.

375
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,510
We have it upstairs.

376
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:25,030
Please.

377
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,550
Please don't do this.

378
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,470
Please, please kill me.

379
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,230
That's exactly what
we are doing, Valentina.

380
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,050
This is not retribution.

381
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,530
It's a real awakening.

382
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,920
Valentina, follow my
instructions if you want to live.

383
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,220
There are more than
five pounds of marrow in

384
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,760
the human body or you
need it's four ounces.

385
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,860
There's more than enough in your femur.

386
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,040
Just suction it out.

387
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,600
When they transfer to
that device right there.

388
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,840
And then deactivate
the fall around your neck.

389
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
Don't hesitate.

390
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:04,860
You should find this prescribed.

391
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:08,840
No.

392
00:56:08,841 --> 00:56:09,841
No.

393
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,300
Now refusing to play the game.

394
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,000
is not an option.

395
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,800
If you refuse,

396
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,400
you'll remain in this room.

397
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,820
Go around.

398
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,620
Let's stop right.

399
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:29,490
Please, please, please.

400
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:30,491
John!

401
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,250
Don't get me.

402
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,990
You have to do this.

403
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,170
No!

404
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:47,190
Don't do it.

405
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:48,250
Don't do it.

406
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,630
Don't do it.

407
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,870
Okay.

408
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,180
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

409
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,460
Stop it down your leg.

410
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:40,040
Stop it down your leg.

411
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,220
Don't!

412
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,120
Don't!

413
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,040
Don't!

414
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:51,360
Don't!

415
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:51,820
Don't!

416
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:52,220
Don't!

417
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,221
Don't!

418
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,420
Don't!

419
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Don't!

420
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,420
Don't!

421
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,460
What?

422
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,620
Sometimes we get sucked into things that.

423
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,940
our kids are in nature
drugs are as vicious.

424
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,280
as they are powerful.

425
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,780
We all have free will.

426
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,880
We all have their own free will.

427
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:40,740
And if you can't handle this,

428
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,480
I'll be mad to the rest of our work.

429
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:06,570
And not to be.

430
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:10,450
Why don't we use the clues
to assign them your senses?

431
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:11,970
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

432
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,030
We need a vote.

433
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,060
Yes.

434
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,760
The pain.

435
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:24,000
It just comes in the waves.

436
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:27,140
Listen, I'm not ready
to do this without you.

437
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,920
You're ready.

438
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,900
You are ready.

439
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,280
And you can.

440
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,020
Listen again.

441
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,100
Listen again.

442
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,060
Don't touch her.

443
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,000
Don't touch me.

444
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,800
Right now I'm under these
people deserve to be tested.

445
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:26,640
That lady doctor deserves nothing.

446
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,680
Everyone deserves a chance.

447
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,080
And I'll pretend they ever do themselves.

448
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,360
You should know that boy or anyone.

449
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,940
What the fuck is that?

450
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:51,760
What are you doing?

451
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,360
What?

452
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:01,900
No?

453
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:12,670
Yeah.

454
01:05:12,671 --> 01:05:13,671
Oh.

455
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,190
Yeah.

456
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,710
Find an egg.

457
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,190
Egg will get up by two.

458
01:06:27,010 --> 01:07:16,000
But my father, Don, is real to you.

459
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,720
And you know that?

460
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,370
He can save you.

461
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Is that you concern?

462
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,460
To you and me?

463
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,860
He can heal you.

464
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,180
I swear to God.

465
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,100
That's who I was trying to call.

466
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:32,980
Let me talk to him.

467
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:35,860
Let me tell him where
we are and he will come.

468
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,680
He will come to help you.

469
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,580
To save my life.

470
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:44,160
They won't help trust
me and I'm the first to try.

471
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,420
Sweet.

472
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
It's so cute.

473
01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:26,530
John.

474
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:27,890
We have a visitor.

475
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,720
My friend is fucking gone.

476
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,320
It's hard to fear.

477
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,460
I'm coming here.

478
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:40,840
I'm coming here.

479
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,020
I'm coming here.

480
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,000
Hey.

481
01:08:43,001 --> 01:08:44,001
Hey.

482
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,120
You saved me.

483
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,640
Hey.

484
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,270
Hey.

485
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:52,590
Hey.

486
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,090
What is this?

487
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,640
Walk in with a gun and
get treated like a criminal.

488
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,900
Who are you?

489
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,100
I was going to ask you the same question.

490
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:13,350
I know you.

491
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,130
I know.

492
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,430
Brain cancer, right?

493
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,380
What are you doing here, Barbara?

494
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:25,260
I can't give my money back.

495
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:28,660
These people are just crooks.

496
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,200
Look at this.

497
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,700
Yeah.

498
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:51,630
Is that me?

499
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:53,630
I'm a material.

500
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:59,030
Gabriella, Valentina,
and Diego was in arm too.

501
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:01,490
You're all calm artists.

502
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:03,930
And we.

503
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:05,850
We were just suckers.

504
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:07,710
Pinch.

505
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:09,130
I gave everything.

506
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,810
All the money I had.

507
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,001
That was for my family, that money.

508
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,990
It's very good with my
kids when I was gone.

509
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:19,750
Let me stand you treated into magic beings.

510
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,110
More time.

511
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,250
The shop of life.

512
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,530
What your life really mean to you, Parker?

513
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:29,010
Have you ever thought about that?

514
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:31,631
Because if you find
the meaning of your life.

515
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,530
What you found is your soul.

516
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:39,330
But when we have your money,
you can be assured of that.

517
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:42,530
But before I let you confront Cecilia,

518
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,650
there is a game that she has
to play out to its conclusion.

519
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:48,510
Wait a minute.

520
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:53,380
Oh God.

521
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,390
You killed Valentina.

522
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,460
We don't kill.

523
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,120
You've jumped a fucking head off!

524
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,380
Valentina died because she
didn't have the wealth to live.

525
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,040
She failed her test.

526
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:05,860
John?

527
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:07,560
He found us here.

528
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,540
Others might too.

529
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,600
And soon we're wasting time.

530
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:12,941
I'm just trying to give this to Sears.

531
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,680
A chance to make his choice.

532
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,600
A choice.

533
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,100
I don't have a choice but he
needs to fucking talk me about.

534
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,560
I'm going to give you an opportunity
to do something super delicate.

535
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,740
With your life.

536
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,080
Right now.

537
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,360
I miss me.

538
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,520
But first I'm going to have to insist.

539
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,140
No cons.

540
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:45,420
Rules are rules.

541
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,760
Consquence is for
grating and we'll be dire.

542
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,720
Understood.

543
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,140
Let's do me now.

544
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,250
John.

545
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,860
I promise you I'm in to one way or another.

546
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:12,380
So I'm going to work out a coordinate plan.

547
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:15,840
Why don't you go and prepare,

548
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,121
and get real enough of the next game.

549
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:22,740
You won't be into it.

550
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,300
No.

551
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,320
But the anesthesiologist is next.

552
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:43,090
Can you please talk to me?

553
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:45,310
Can you please talk to me?

554
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:46,450
Please talk to me.

555
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:47,970
You fucking bitch!

556
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:49,650
You fucking god!

557
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:51,910
Help me.

558
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:03,590
Help me.

559
01:14:03,591 --> 01:14:04,050
Help me.

560
01:14:04,051 --> 01:14:05,890
Please don't. I just did. You were next.

561
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:08,050
He's the monster. He's going to kill you.
He's going to kill you.

562
01:14:08,051 --> 01:14:08,890
He's going to kill you all the best.

563
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,070
You don't know John.

564
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,990
You like it.

565
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:32,310
That's how to shoot that thief in the face.

566
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,560
First we must do seers.

567
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,400
In short order.

568
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,560
Show wish the new era.

569
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,120
Hold on.

570
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,400
No.

571
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:00,280
What is it?

572
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:01,460
What is it?

573
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:03,660
I don't know what the
fuck all these things are.

574
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,320
What do you think?

575
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,780
And there's a fucking bone cutter.

576
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,160
The crayons.

577
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,440
I don't care what the
fucking thing is called.

578
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,660
That's Elliot.

579
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,640
They're just playing me.

580
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:16,840
I'm not going to talk to him.

581
01:16:16,841 --> 01:16:18,840
What the fuck?

582
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:22,500
What the fuck?

583
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:26,080
What the fuck?

584
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:26,500
What the fuck?

585
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,501
Hello, Mateo.

586
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,560
It's time to play the game.

587
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,700
The rules are simple.

588
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,100
Place a big enough piece of
yours so you can teach you.

589
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,560
Into the glass inside tank.

590
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:38,900
And you, yeah.

591
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,500
A piece of what?

592
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,080
A piece of what?

593
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:42,680
A piece of what?

594
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:43,681
Great matter.

595
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,280
What does that mean?

596
01:16:46,460 --> 01:16:47,460
A piece of the brain.

597
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:48,040
This is insane.

598
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,360
This is insane.

599
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:49,580
Crazy.

600
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,840
Crazy.

601
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,780
If you complete your task
in less than three minutes,

602
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:09,600
the enzymes will dissolve
the tissue to close a circuit.

603
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,480
This will save you life.

604
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,400
But know this.

605
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,920
The brain is a remarkably resilient organ.

606
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,680
There are an accounts of people undergoing
complete anatomical lamispyrectomies,

607
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,420
as the brain remote,

608
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:30,040
only to have it rewire itself so
that the patient not only survives,

609
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,020
but thrives.

610
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:35,080
I don't know how to do this.

611
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:46,260
The only thing I have not
provided is your anaesthetic.

612
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:47,600
But trust me,

613
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,440
you will want to remain alert.

614
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,200
And if you fail to act,

615
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:56,900
the consequences will not go well for you.

616
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,600
Do not waste time.

617
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,760
Little time.

618
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,300
The choice is yours.

619
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:12,520
Okay, take it, take it, take it.

620
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:18,120
Damn.

621
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:19,780
What do we do? What do we do?

622
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,520
What do we do?

623
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:21,840
You have to use the radiator.

624
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:23,580
What do we do?

625
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,880
Not going to fucking happen.

626
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:29,740
You have to cut it to your skull.

627
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,780
No.

628
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,020
I can't do it.

629
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,900
Do you want to live?

630
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,200
Or wind up like that?

631
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:40,780
Okay.

632
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,220
Is there a cable?

633
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,820
Is there a seat?

634
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,160
Sure.

635
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:51,500
Yes.

636
01:20:50,480 --> 01:21:56,330
You guys are fucking sick.

637
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,210
We're sick.

638
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,870
These people will kill with force.

639
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,330
Oh.

640
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:21,620
What if there is something
her father can do to help you?

641
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,720
Amanda, you know, as well as I do.

642
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,820
People will say almost anything.

643
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:29,600
Save their own life.

644
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:30,960
Yeah, but her father is real.

645
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:32,680
We both know that.

646
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,380
Amanda, the reality is...

647
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,480
I'm dying.

648
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:40,460
I am dying.

649
01:22:40,461 --> 01:22:43,320
You have to face that.

650
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,060
But I'm worse not than I had.

651
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,740
I'm trusting.

652
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,500
Trusting.

653
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,300
You.

654
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:54,920
The area.

655
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:27,970
It's almost morning.

656
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,030
We got a job to do.

657
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:31,850
We're running out of time.

658
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,250
I want you to go and free.

659
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:36,230
Mr. Sears.

660
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,410
I can see you don't play by the rules.

661
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,400
Mmm.

662
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,560
Mmm.

663
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:54,400
No.

664
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:57,480
Don't be a... You have to take.

665
01:23:58,880 --> 01:23:59,880
No.

666
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,740
I'll never get out of here otherwise.

667
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:32,010
Hello, Gabriel.

668
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:34,630
I want to play a game.

669
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:36,070
No, no, stop it.

670
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:37,510
Stop it.

671
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,220
I'm afraid that's not going to work.

672
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:46,240
You are going to have to play the game.

673
01:25:04,850 --> 01:25:05,850
No.

674
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,480
No.

675
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:17,500
No.

676
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:19,240
No.

677
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:51,840
Most of you all pretended
to cure my cancer.

678
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,020
I have spent years in treatment.

679
01:25:55,700 --> 01:26:01,560
Immunotherapy, immunotherapy,
radiation machines are not.

680
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:05,400
I'm afraid to be trifled with the
following instructions carefully, Gabriel.

681
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:22,940
The only way out is to free your
hand and ankle from the shackles.

682
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:24,960
Use the tool above you.

683
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,440
No.

684
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:26,960
No.

685
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,840
You can't.

686
01:26:27,841 --> 01:26:28,841
You can't.

687
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:31,930
Broken bones heal.

688
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:34,190
Flesh can be grafted.

689
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:36,730
It will not be easy.

690
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,340
Like life.

691
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:42,680
Ever is.

692
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,560
Let's wake up on the way.

693
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:10,920
I did it, Gabby.

694
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,620
Gabby!

695
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,520
Okay, play tons of it.

696
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:34,040
If guns were against the
rules, fuck your rules, John.

697
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,640
The keys to the city has changed.

698
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,260
Don't need the keys.

699
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,480
She's not going anywhere.

700
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:15,180
Come on.

701
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:16,460
Move.

702
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,430
Don't you have a gun about me?

703
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:25,750
Not a chance.

704
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:27,610
You know, I die for you, baby.

705
01:30:34,090 --> 01:30:35,090
I'm Locker.

706
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:37,330
No!

707
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:52,870
No!

708
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,190
I'm one who should do that.

709
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:06,040
Come on, old man.

710
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:07,640
Lock yourself in.

711
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:18,700
Come on, move!

712
01:31:18,701 --> 01:31:19,701
Move!

713
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,040
New game.

714
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,160
It's called We Live.

715
01:31:59,700 --> 01:31:59,980
You die.

716
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:01,620
Fuck you.

717
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:02,660
Simply enough.

718
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:04,740
I told you Parker would break the rules.

719
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:06,480
Filled your test asshole.

720
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,500
We need to get her to our hospital.

721
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,280
She don't want her getting,
and she deserves to live.

722
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:15,080
Oh, actually now.

723
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,360
Her injury is named medical treatment.

724
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:20,740
Do you think?

725
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:27,810
Tell me.

726
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:28,930
Don't think about it.

727
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,280
Unfortunately.

728
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:55,210
The keys.

729
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:07,600
Fuck yourself in.

730
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:41,660
Don't tell me, John.

731
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:44,000
You've been doing
this for a very long time.

732
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:44,440
How would you?

733
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:46,460
How would I stop you?

734
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,480
Am I just that good?

735
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:51,440
Don't flatter yourself.

736
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,240
How'd you say who works in charge of them?

737
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:55,100
That's all.

738
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,520
Yeah, I agree.

739
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:58,380
For a guy as smart as you are, John.

740
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:01,820
You're kind of a little page
around everyone you say.

741
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:03,580
You didn't give a shit though.

742
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,380
All your friends are dead because of you.

743
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:09,340
Not friends.

744
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,800
They were loose bands, as we taught.

745
01:34:12,475 --> 01:34:13,480
Nothing but loose ends.

746
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:16,091
If you want to know what I thought.

747
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,640
I watched them each die.

748
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:21,340
One less person just picked them anyway.

749
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:23,200
So thank you.

750
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:24,880
You did me a favor.

751
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,500
You're going to have to
get the money back from me.

752
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,900
Before you took the split.

753
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:32,260
I think we're getting money back.

754
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:33,600
Substairs.

755
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,340
You know she's eventually
going to kill you too, right?

756
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:37,700
Fuck off, Amanda.

757
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:39,320
Amanda's all right.

758
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:40,640
She's going to burn you.

759
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,860
You just can't see it yet.

760
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,880
Is that really all you've got left, John?

761
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,520
When I realized who you really were.

762
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:51,480
Jake fucking saw.

763
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,480
I got a bit worried.

764
01:34:56,020 --> 01:34:57,020
I got a sonist.

765
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,960
And now the great John Kramer is
going to die in one of his own traps.

766
01:35:03,160 --> 01:35:04,400
There's something we get irony.

767
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:08,440
And the craziest thing is that
you could have just walked away.

768
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:12,060
A knowledge that you've got beat.

769
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:13,980
You've got to count.

770
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:15,980
But now.

771
01:35:17,710 --> 01:35:19,960
You're just trying to
come back and continue.

772
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:26,720
Why don't we put this bitch on the
other side of that thing and press play?

773
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,760
You know this fucking
asshole is dead in two months.

774
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:53,300
But I want him to suffer.

775
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,400
Like he made me suffer.

776
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:59,240
I want this last memory to be
watching someone innocent die.

777
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:01,280
If you think I'm innocent.

778
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:03,100
You.

779
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:04,780
Not for a second.

780
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:13,480
I don't think we're here or no, son.

781
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:20,880
Jake, are you kidding?

782
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:59,770
It's an terrible one for
seeing God's wants.

783
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:10,540
Please don't judge this.

784
01:37:12,700 --> 01:37:13,700
The boy says.

785
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:15,660
Exactly.

786
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:19,120
If you let him die, it's all on you.

787
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:25,460
And we get this thing started.

788
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:28,061
It's activated by the subject.

789
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,700
Of course.

790
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:36,060
Because you wouldn't be responsible
for killing anyone, would you?

791
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:37,920
How can he have got hurt?

792
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:41,820
Well, you might want to tell
the kid the rules before we start.

793
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,280
He's not a player.

794
01:37:45,655 --> 01:37:46,655
In any of this.

795
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:47,980
Oh, come on John.

796
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,440
Get the scary boys.

797
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,440
I don't want to play, game.

798
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:55,960
No.

799
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,720
You really want the boy to
play without airing the rules.

800
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,700
I don't think it's gonna fit well.

801
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,330
John, I will cut his throat.

802
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:39,980
It's not right.

803
01:38:39,981 --> 01:38:40,981
I'm really.

804
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,400
Electron moral decency.

805
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:45,240
From you.

806
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:46,960
You've got 10 seconds.

807
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,580
We're here to deliver myself.

808
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:50,980
And I don't have a
silly moral code like you.

809
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:52,040
Trust me.

810
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:56,860
Of course.

811
01:39:00,910 --> 01:39:01,910
Don't let him.

812
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:04,850
Confronting.

813
01:39:06,590 --> 01:39:07,590
Don't let him.

814
01:39:09,950 --> 01:39:11,310
Turn it on, Parker.

815
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:12,830
Let's go.

816
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:23,450
Hold on.

817
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:02,490
Let's go.

818
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:08,660
Once I heard your voice over
that speaker, then you'll be fine.

819
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:12,241
John would be a bit full of the
whole dancing, whole line and singer.

820
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:26,273
But if you were the
last player, who was

821
01:43:26,285 --> 01:43:29,060
supposed to be on the
side of that play with you?

822
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:33,420
There's the money.

823
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:31,230
You.

824
01:45:31,231 --> 01:45:31,350
You.

825
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:35,820
A warrior.

826
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:38,020
Are you okay?

827
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,840
No, exactly.

828
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:41,620
Yes, we're planted.

829
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:43,020
But.

830
01:45:52,410 --> 01:45:53,410
Parker!

831
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:53,870
He knows.

832
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:55,310
He wasn't in.

833
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:56,650
He's a handler.

834
01:45:56,910 --> 01:45:58,170
He's fucking silly too.

835
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:04,850
I was able to find the
man who has four hands.

836
01:46:05,490 --> 01:46:06,490
Ah.

837
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:06,930
Good.

838
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,550
But Dr. Hughes.

839
01:46:09,590 --> 01:46:10,890
You'll have to find another way.

840
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:20,700
Do you have a visitor?

841
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:40,750
Parker, Sears.

842
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:45,730
You've each been working a great play role.

843
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,630
Work.

844
01:46:52,470 --> 01:47:26,050
Never realizing that you lost a game.

845
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:27,670
But two of you.

846
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:38,890
Now you'll work against each other.

847
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:44,170
Only one can survive.

848
01:47:45,350 --> 01:48:52,460
Do we kill you too, right?
Fuck off of them.

849
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:29,750
Donna!

850
01:51:27,950 --> 01:51:29,150
Where's your skull?

851
01:51:31,010 --> 01:51:32,010
Henry?

852
01:51:33,410 --> 01:51:34,410
Thank you, Detective.

853
01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:37,750
For locating my fellow cancer patient.

854
01:51:44,330 --> 01:51:48,550
Out of all the mentorship.

855
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:51,910
You pick John Kramer?

856
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:55,190
I mean.

857
01:51:55,990 --> 01:51:57,110
I call that.

858
01:51:58,430 --> 01:51:59,690
Epic bad luck.

859
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:01,370
Please.

860
01:52:02,130 --> 01:52:03,270
John, please.

861
01:52:04,730 --> 01:52:06,170
Please don't kill me.

862
01:52:06,870 --> 01:52:09,250
That's the last thing you
should be worried about.

863
01:52:10,770 --> 01:52:11,770
No.

864
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:14,830
I want to play a game.

865
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:18,750
Please don't kill me.

866
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:19,790
Go.

867
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:21,970
You're just gonna die.

868
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,760
Kr Easy.

869
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,320
Go.

870
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:32,760
But you're not gonna die.

871
01:52:32,761 --> 01:52:34,161
Have you seen any of this fun game?
