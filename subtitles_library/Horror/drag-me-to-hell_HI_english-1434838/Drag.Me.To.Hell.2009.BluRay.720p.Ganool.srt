Good sounds abound when the mouth is round.

00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,888
Round. Round.

33
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:29,248
I think we can make this work. I'll call you this afternoon and let you know.

34
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,414
-Thank you so much. -Thank you.

35
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,458
-You're welcome. -Thank you.

36
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,121
-Thank you. -Have a great day.

00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,786
-Yeah, you, too. Have a good day. -Okay.

WOMAN: Here you go, Mr Jacks. MR JACKS: Thank you.

41
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,807
Mr Jacks?

42
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:02,051
I was wondering if you'd made any decision regarding the assistant manager's position.

43
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,653
Well, I'm still deciding, and right now, it's between Stu and yourself.

44
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,988
Stu Rubin, the new guy?

45
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:11,861
Well, I know he's new, but he's also quite aggressive, and we like that.

46
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,559
You know, Stu's someone who's not afraid to crunch the numbers

47
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,499
and make the tough decisions.

48
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,164
I'm perfectly capable of making the tough decisions.

49
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,572
I'll let you know as soon as I decide. Okay?

50
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,878
In the meantime, take him through our loan qualifying procedures,

51
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,413
just in case, all right?

52
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,243
Okay.

53
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,577
MR JACKS: And would you mind taking your lunch break now?

54
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:35,746
Sure.

55
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:39,019
And maybe on your way back, you could pick me up a turkey club?

56
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:43,995
Turkey club, excellent choice! You mind picking one up for me? Thanks.

57
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,023
And spicy mustard.

58
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,901
-What have you got? -Could I get your approval on this?

59
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,731
-This is the loan we talked about before. -The loan.

60
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,031
Exactly.

61
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,234
-Good one, huh? -One-point-five?

62
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,399
Absolutely, and it'll be one of many.

63
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,347
Well, Professor, congratulations on making it through your first week.

64
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,613
Thank you very much. Mmm.

65
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,453
-I thought you'd have a full beard by now. -So did I. I'm a little disappointed.

66
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:14,956
Man, this thing. That's it. I'm done. I'm out.

67
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,793
Chris, don't even bother.

68
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,095
I gotta get a new one.

69
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,692
I'm telling you, you're gonna drive yourself nuts. It's completely

70
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,635
broken.

71
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:34,472
-Was broken. -You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.

72
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,212
I almost forgot. Found it at the bank.

73
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,543
What is this?

74
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:47,254
No way! Wow. It's a 1929 Standing Liberty, and it's almost fully struck.

75
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,122
You found this in regular circulation at the bank?

76
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,287
I did.

77
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,594
I'm gonna add this to my nerdy coin collection.

78
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,663
-Thank you, baby. -Okay.

79
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,669
Thanks for thinking of me.

80
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,834
-All right. Bye. -Bye.

81
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:03,068

<i>But you know your father and I</i> <i>just have certain expectations for you</i>.

-<i>for someone to play tennis with</i>. -Yeah, I...

-<i>I would love to see you with.</i> -Mother...

-No, I didn't. -Yeah, I said no mayo.

Of course. What can I do for you?

Your trucks are at my house. The men are packing all my things,

(HAWKING)

127
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,240
Mrs Ganush, the bank is informing you

128
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:23,544
of their intent to repossess your property at 325 Brandon Street today.

129
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,710
But this is my home for 30 years.

130
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:31,920
And I make every payment until the sickness took my eye.

131
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:37,059
I hope to have more money soon. I just need a little more time. You...

132
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:40,496
I don't think my manager's going to extend you any more credit.

133
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:45,762
Please. Won't you try?

134
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,938
-Okay. -Bless you.

135
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,338
Bless you!

136
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,445
CHRISTINE: We have an elderly woman asking

137
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,014
for an extension on her mortgage payment.

138
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,618
She's on a fixed income, and she's had some medical problems.

139
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,688
There's gotta be something we can do to help her.

140
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,773
MR JACKS: Well, apparently, we've already granted her two extensions.

141
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,842
And, you know, on this type of foreclosure, we seize the trapped equity

142
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,380
and the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.

143
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,677
We would have to throw her out of her house.

144
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,479
It's a tough decision.

145
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,152
Your call.

146
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,175
I'll take care of it.

147
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,338
Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,

148
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,203
but another extension on the loan is out of the question.

149
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,766
-What? -I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...

150
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:36,281
No, please, this is my home. Where will I live?

151
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,347
You list your granddaughter as a reference. Maybe you could stay with her.

152
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,045
I would not burden her.

153
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,218
And there are several fine assisted living facilities for the elderly...

154
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:51,127
A nursing home? No, I would never live in one of those places.

155
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,894
I'm really sorry.

156
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,423
I am proud woman, Miss Brown,

157
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,764
and never have I begged for anything.

158
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,165
But now, I beg for you.

159
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:34,003
-I humble myself before you. -Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.

160
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,769
-Please stand up. -I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

161
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,835
On my mother's grave, I beg you!

162
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:44,112
Please let go. Let go! Security! Stop!

Are you okay?

176
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,243
You handled that just right, you know.

177
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,829
GUARD: Good night. See you tomorrow. WOMAN: Okay.

178
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:15,169
You know, I just finished going over this McPherson loan.

179
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,675
-This is very impressive work. -Thanks.

180
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:21,212
Would you mind taking this home tonight and finishing it up?

181
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,545
Because I would like to show it to the regional veep in the morning.

182
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,414
-I would love to. -Great.

183
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,884
Thank you.

184
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:31,446
And as far as that assistant manager's position goes,

185
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,523
you're at the top of the list.

186
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:31,242
You shamed me.

187
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:35,862
I beat you, you old bitch!

188
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:06,726
No!

189
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:37,689
Lamia.

190
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,207
Soon it will be you who comes begging to me.

191
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,574
OFFICER: She's right over there. CLAY: Thank you, thank you.

192
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:32,380
Hey!

193
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,016
Once they send some officers over to have a talk with her,

194
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:40,389
she's not gonna be bothering you any more, okay?

195
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:41,951
So don't even think about her.

196
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:43,587
And I'm gonna call Mr Jacks and just make sure

197
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:45,859
he can have somebody walk you to your car every night, okay?

198
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:47,195
CHRISTINE: Okay.

199
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:51,535
I just thank God you're okay. You are okay, right?

200
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,635
I'm fine.

201
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,308
What? What's the matter?

202
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:03,109
It's just that maybe I could have gotten her another extension on her loan.

203
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,582
Chris, no, don't do that.

204
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:07,815
You said the bank granted this woman two extensions already, right?

205
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,981
I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage, you lose your house.

206
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,753
What does this woman expect? It's not your fault.

207
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:15,387
You can't beat yourself up over it.

208
00:23:22,337 --> 00:23:25,101
CLAY: I mean, what'd she expect? It's not your fault.

209
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:28,336
And regardless of what you may or may not have been able to do,

210
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,238
that's still no justification for her...

211
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,750
What is it? What's wrong?

212
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,259
-Did you hear that? -What?

213
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,183
Really? You didn't?

214
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:50,357
No. What?

215
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:57,865
I know this is gonna sound weird, but I wanna get my fortune read.

216
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,876
(LAUGHS) Now? Are you kidding?

217
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:07,378
Come on, Chris. I'll read your fortune for you.

218
00:24:07,882 --> 00:24:09,873
In the near future, we are gonna get in the car,

219
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,885
-go home and relax. -Clay, I really want to do this.

220
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:15,717
Why? Because of what happened with that old woman?

221
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:19,122
Chris, I really think we should just get you home now.

222
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:22,487
Can you do this for me?

223
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:33,238
I pray to God none of my students see me here.

224
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:37,973
The only class I'll be able to teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.

225
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,807
Yeah, there's so many things to choose from here.

226
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:46,478
Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for, which is a weird little dried monkey head.

227
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,748
Wait, no, never mind, he's got one.

228
00:24:51,426 --> 00:24:53,758
I am Rham Jas, seer.

229
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:59,430
-I'm Christine and this is Clay. -But you probably already knew that, right?

230
00:25:01,102 --> 00:25:04,037
-Just kidding. -How can I help you?

231
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:07,700
I would like to have my fortune read. Can you do that?

232
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,835
I have the ability to see certain energies.

233
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:14,540
Sometimes these energies are a foretoken of things to come.

-Seriously? -Yes.

236
00:25:17,785 --> 00:25:21,448
Sixty... Doesn't that seem a little steep for this sort of thing?

237
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:26,357
-If you're not serious, please go. -All right. Come on, Chris.

238
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:29,021
Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.

239
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,293
No, you know what? You know what? I got it. I got it.

240
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:37,131
-There you go. -Platinum card. Very good.

241
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:44,472

242
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:46,445
-Here, here, baby. -Thanks.

243
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:47,741
Sure.

244
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:52,915
Uh-uh. Please.

245
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:54,810
Okay.

246
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:58,423
So, you wish to know something of your destiny.

247
00:25:58,493 --> 00:25:59,653
-Yes. -Very good.

248

Let's see what the fates have in store.

249
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:03,593
CLAY: You know, Freud said destiny was not an act of fate,

250
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:05,427
but rather something created by our subconscious

251
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,297
to control our conscious choices.

252
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:12,429
That's true. But we cannot attempt to understand the world by intellect alone.

253
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:14,836
-Carl Jung. -Yes.

254
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,570
From his treatise <i>Psychological Types.</i>

255
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,080
-So... -Jung, the New Agers' favourite psychologist.

256
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:24,447
Because he wasn't afraid to bring God into the equation.

257
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,816
Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...

258
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,321
-Clay, Clay, come on. -Let's do it. I know. Come on. Let's start.

259
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:31,186
-Shall we? -I'm ready.

260
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,952
Very well. Please, give me your hand.

261
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:34,688

262
00:26:35,196 --> 00:26:36,925

That's right.

265
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:51,309
And you've recently lost something.

266
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:58,942
-No, I don't think so. -No. No, you haven't lost anything.

267
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:02,386
But something's been taken from you.

268
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,451
No.

269
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,994
-RHAM JAS: A button. -Oh, my God. Yes!

270
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:10,727
Well, anyone can see she's missing a button! So what?

271
00:27:10,832 --> 00:27:12,060
But, Clay, it was really strange.

272
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,566
The old woman today, she took a button from my sleeve.

273
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:18,503
-Why would she do that? -If you would both please just be quiet!

Did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a graveyard?

282
00:28:49,397 --> 00:28:51,456
-No! -Did you play with a Ouija board

283
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,396
or consort with those who practise the black arts?

284

Perhaps someone has cursed you.

And by the way, he didn't really know that much.

289
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:14,353
He makes a couple of good guesses, then he...

290
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:17,356
He stirs you up, and then he leaves you with all these questions

Well, he sort of tried, but in the end, he took it, didn't he?

491
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,321
No.

492
00:52:54,564 --> 00:53:00,230
I mean, not any more. We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.

493
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:02,965
-Geese? -Well, right around the harvest time,

494
00:53:03,072 --> 00:53:06,166
that's when your goose eggs will make a real dense yolk.

495
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:08,734
It makes for a rich cake.

496
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:12,982
Well, just thank you.

497
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:16,315
-Here we are. -Sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.

498
00:53:16,419 --> 00:53:17,613
-Why don't you join us in the dining room? -Good.

499
00:53:17,687 --> 00:53:20,417
-Yeah, let's go. It's right in here. -Okay.

500
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,855
(HISSING)

501
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:23,516
-Jeez. -Hecuba.

502
00:53:24,527 --> 00:53:27,189
I never did understand that damned animal. I hate cats.

503
00:53:27,297 --> 00:53:30,926
That is so strange. Hecuba is usually very sweet.

504
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,833
That's okay. I had a cat. I understand.

505
00:53:34,504 --> 00:53:36,995
You mean... You mean you have a cat.

506
00:53:38,274 --> 00:53:39,605
What do you mean? Did something happen?

507
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:41,701
Unless something happened to him.

508
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,541
Well, how am I supposed to know?

509
00:53:46,949 --> 00:53:50,112
I mean, you know how cats are. They come and they go.

510
00:53:51,788 --> 00:53:52,880
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

511
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:54,780
That's true.

512
00:53:57,126 --> 00:54:00,061
-Well, should... -Well... Yes. Yes, please.

513
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,060
So, how's the coin collection, son?

514
00:54:03,166 --> 00:54:06,033
That's my dad's way of saying, "So, you're still a huge nerd?"

515
00:54:06,135 --> 00:54:08,467
It's good. It's good. In fact, Christine just got me

516
00:54:08,538 --> 00:54:10,506
a 1929 Standing Liberty quarter at her bank.

517
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:12,632
-Really? -Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.

518
00:54:12,709 --> 00:54:16,008
I just think the job of a bank teller must be so difficult,

519
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,742
with all that counting and repetition. It must get very tedious.

520
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:21,043
Yes, you're right,

521
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,314
-but I'm not a teller. -Oh?

522
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,183
CLAY: Yeah, Mom, I told you. Christine's a loan officer.

523
00:54:25,254 --> 00:54:28,587
She handles all the loans for small businesses and homes for her bank.

524
00:54:28,691 --> 00:54:32,218
And she's up for this big promotion, so... Right, Chris?

525
00:54:32,328 --> 00:54:35,491
If I could close this one account that I'm working on, it would really help.

526
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:37,658
That must be a very important loan.

527
00:54:37,734 --> 00:54:40,567
It's the biggest that my branch has ever handled.

528
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,831
And how did that come to you?

529
00:54:43,172 --> 00:54:45,333
Well, I was reading the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>

530
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:47,706
and came across this medical supply company

531
00:54:47,777 --> 00:54:51,213
that was looking to expand but didn't have the liquidity.

532
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,181
So I met with their CFO and presented a formula

533
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,014
for restructuring some of their long-term debt.

534
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:59,680
Sounds like you've got a lot going for you, Christine.

535
00:54:59,756 --> 00:55:02,623
Well, your mother must be very proud of you.

536
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:04,258
I suppose.

537
00:55:10,233 --> 00:55:12,201
I don't see much of my mother.

538
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:15,465
-Why is that? -Wow, Mom, that's... It's kind of personal.

539
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:17,630
TRUDY: I'm speaking to Christine.

540
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:26,245
Well, ever since my dad died, she doesn't talk much.

541
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:33,087
She just stays on the farm and keeps to herself because...

542
00:55:34,424 --> 00:55:35,891
Because?

543
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,724
Because her husband died, Mom, and she just wants to be by herself.

544
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:42,890
-Why don't... -Because my mother's an alcoholic.

545
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,624
Oh.

546
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,626
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry.

547
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:52,402
It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.

548
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:56,340
I have to say, I find your honesty very refreshing.

549
00:55:57,246 --> 00:56:00,579
My father had a drinking problem, and I was always too ashamed to admit it.

550
00:56:01,818 --> 00:56:03,683
You've got backbone.

551
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:06,082
Unlike that last girl he brought by.

552
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,747
-What was her name? -Alice.

553
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,348
-CLAY: We don't have to... -Alicia!

554
00:56:09,459 --> 00:56:11,586
-Alicia. -She was dreadful, Christine.

555
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:14,755
She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.

556
00:56:14,831 --> 00:56:15,957
-CLAY: That's not really... -They met on the Internet.

557
00:56:16,032 --> 00:56:17,124
-There you go. -CLAY: What is that,

558
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,258
-"They met on the Internet"? -CHRISTINE: Really?

559
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:20,598
-What does that mean? -Am I being too hard on him?

560
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,694
No, not at all.

561
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:23,135
-There you go. Thank you very much. -CLAY: Thanks a lot...

562
00:56:23,206 --> 00:56:24,867
You know, I think I will try some of that cake of yours.

563
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:26,305
CLAY: ...for tossing me under the bus. LEONARD: Look at that. It looks great.

00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,340
-You're gonna like it. -TRUDY: It looks so interesting.

566
00:56:30,446 --> 00:56:33,813
You only dislike it if you hate delicious things.

567
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:37,442
LEONARD: Well, that counts us out. TRUDY: Not my problem.

568
00:56:38,821 --> 00:56:39,845
TRUDY: Lovely.

569
00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:41,446
LEONARD: Thank you, Christine. This is wonderful.

570
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,355
CLAY: It also changed the subject nicely.

571
00:56:43,459 --> 00:56:45,188
Thank you. That looks good!

572

LEONARD: Harvest cake, huh? CLAY: That's right.

573
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,130
LEONARD: We'll have to get this recipe. TRUDY: It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?

574
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,030
Did you hear something?

575
00:56:52,502 --> 00:56:54,129
No. You okay?

576
00:56:54,804 --> 00:56:55,964
TRUDY: Tasty!

-I like it a lot. -I do like it.

578
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:03,505
CLAY: You know, Mom, when you say we met on the Internet, it's a little misleading.

(GASPS)

580
00:57:21,931 --> 00:57:24,661
TRUDY: Yes, well you need to do that to find a good mate.

581
00:57:24,734 --> 00:57:26,258
CLAY: She has a Facebook... TRUDY: You can't even trust

582
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:28,496
the things you hear or that people write about themselves.

583
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,596
-Very nice. -Even the pictures are false half the time.

584
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:31,900
-Isn't that true? -CLAY: It's true.

585
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:34,033
-It doesn't really count. -TRUDY: I don't think it's a misconception

586
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,737
to think that people of good breeding

587
00:57:35,845 --> 00:57:40,043
and success should be able to meet potential life partners in a realistic situation.

588
00:57:40,116 --> 00:57:41,708
CLAY: Well, you also have a thing about bars.

(LOUD CREAKING)

00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,123
Would you, Christine?

00:57:55,464 --> 00:58:00,265
-No. No, of course not. -CLAY: What? What... But we did.

592
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:02,234
We met at a bar, Chris. What are you talking about?

00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:04,102
-Oh, my God, that's right! -CLAY: She...

594
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:08,609
-You two better get your stories straight. -CLAY: It's not a Klan rally, Mom. It's a bar.

595
00:58:10,313 --> 00:58:14,750
Yeah, we met... We met at a bar, and we set up the date on the Internet.

596
00:58:15,718 --> 00:58:18,744
You okay? You okay?

Some water? Baby, have some... Went down the wrong pipe.

Oh, my God!

00:58:37,773 --> 00:58:40,241
I'm sorry, I don't... There must be a window open.

-I know. Wait, Chris... -Don't follow her! She's a sick girl.

-Mom, she needs my help. -Let her go.

Look, I did what you said! I killed that little kitty!

You're so full of shit!

615
00:59:24,887 --> 00:59:27,685
These are elusive and powerful forces we are dealing with.

616
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:29,724
There are no guarantees.

617
00:59:47,243 --> 00:59:50,144
We must speak directly to this dark spirit.

618
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,411
We must dissuade it from taking your soul, and soon.

-I know someone who can help us. -And I'm supposed to trust you?

Tomorrow is the third day. After that, the Lamia will come for you.

621
01:00:03,759 --> 01:00:06,922
We can't let that happen. But you must understand,

622
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:11,592
the woman who can help us must put herself at great risk.

623
01:00:11,934 --> 01:00:15,426
-She will not do that for free. -What do you need from me?

$10,000 cash

01:00:19,508 --> 01:00:20,770
by tomorrow.

-Mr Jacks. -Yeah?

627
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:40,959
This is kind of awkward for me, and I know it's not official yet,

628
01:00:42,031 --> 01:00:45,728
but I was wondering if I could get an advance for the new position.

629
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:48,031
What, the assistant manager's position?

630
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:51,368
Yes. See, one of my family members is really sick.

631
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:55,868
-They're not gonna die, but they could. -Christine. Christine.

632
01:00:55,978 --> 01:01:00,608
There's a problem. The McPherson deal was cancelled last night.

633
01:01:00,716 --> 01:01:02,149
-What? -Yeah.

634
01:01:02,818 --> 01:01:06,549
Right after I informed the regional office that we had this big loan pending,

635
01:01:06,655 --> 01:01:10,147
I find out that they just made their deal over at First National.

636
01:01:10,259 --> 01:01:12,124
Now, I gotta call in to see what exactly happened,

637
01:01:12,228 --> 01:01:16,164
but right now, this does not look too good for you or for me.

638
01:01:17,733 --> 01:01:21,999
So, this assistant manager promotion has been delayed.

639
01:01:23,105 --> 01:01:26,074
In fact, you know, I think, with everything that's been happening,

640
01:01:26,175 --> 01:01:29,338
I think I'm gonna have to give this job to Stu.

641
01:01:30,246 --> 01:01:32,009
Stu. I see.

642
01:01:33,082 --> 01:01:35,744
I'm sorry. Look, if you've got family problems,

643
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:39,343

But this stuff is worth so much more than that.

But then I thought, "Screw it, I'm eating ice cream."

655
01:03:50,653 --> 01:03:52,314
I paid Rham Jas.

What? You're kidding me.

657
01:03:59,662 --> 01:04:01,220
I paid him.

Why? I mean, I thought that you didn't believe.

659

I don't know what I believe in any more.

660
01:04:08,905 --> 01:04:12,671
I really don't, but I know that you believe in this.

661
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:15,437
I know how important it is to you,

662
01:04:15,511 --> 01:04:18,912
and I know how much pain this is causing you.

663
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:24,078
And, I also remembered...

664
01:04:24,854 --> 01:04:27,584
I remembered a promise that I made

665
01:04:28,691 --> 01:04:31,023
the night I fell in love with you.

666
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,355
I told myself that I would...

667
01:04:34,096 --> 01:04:38,032
I would always look out for you. I'd always take care of you.

668
01:04:39,869 --> 01:04:41,359
So I paid him.

669

You remember the night that you fell in love with me?

670

I remember the second I fell in love with you.

You sure you don't want me to go in with you?

He said I should come alone.

01:05:10,566 --> 01:05:13,899
Yeah, I know, I know he did. He told me the same thing.

01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:51,934
Christine, if you will permit me

-Welcome. -How do you do?

678
01:06:02,118 --> 01:06:04,348
Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.

679
01:06:04,453 --> 01:06:07,547
Furthermore, she's personally been touched by the Lamia.

680
01:06:07,623 --> 01:06:12,117
I first encountered this spirit many years ago in this very house.

681
01:06:13,462 --> 01:06:15,123
And what happened?

682
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:22,034
I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.

683
01:06:27,476 --> 01:06:31,242
I have waited these long years

684
01:06:32,315 --> 01:06:35,807
for a chance at redeeming myself,

685
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:39,447
a chance to destroy the foul thing.

-And... -MILOS: <i>Tetieo,</i> please.

Tonight, my chance will come.

01:06:51,667 --> 01:06:55,330
But to summon it, I will need your help.

689
01:06:56,806 --> 01:06:58,467
Can you be strong?

690

I'll try.

691
01:07:07,683 --> 01:07:10,846
My late husband, Sandor, was also medium.

692
01:07:11,454 --> 01:07:13,354
He chose this site to build a house upon

693
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:17,357
because he sensed certain forces at work here.

694

something you don't want me to tell him.

<i>STU: Oh, yeah? Like what?</i>

844

Well, for starters, that you stole the McPherson loan file off my desk

845
01:23:22,057 --> 01:23:25,390
and gave it to First National. Now you got nine minutes!

-Give me another. -Seriously?

847

Oh, God, Christine, please don't tell on me. I mean, if my dad ever finds out...

848
01:23:45,747 --> 01:23:49,046
-Just tell me what you want. -I need to give something to you.

849
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:51,243
-A little gift. -A gift?

850
01:23:52,721 --> 01:23:55,019
But I don't understand. I thought you called me down here

851
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:56,990
because I gave that loan to First National...

852
01:23:57,092 --> 01:24:00,220
Look, you don't need to understand. Just shut up!

853
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:04,393
Now, this gift that I'm giving you, it'll become your property.

854
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:07,093
You'll be the owner, all right?
