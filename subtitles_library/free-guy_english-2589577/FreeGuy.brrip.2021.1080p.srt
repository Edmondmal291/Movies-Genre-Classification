<b><i>This is Free City.</i></b>

2
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:59,477
<b><i>Look at this guy.
He's one of the sunglasses people.</i></b>

3
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:02,731
<b><i>And the people who wear sunglasses
are heroes.</i></b>

4
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:12,824
<b><i>They have a devil-may-care attitude
and they run this town.</i></b>

5
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,454
<b>You are so hot.</b>

6
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,621
<b>Oh, I know.</b>

7
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,377
<b><i>See? That's not even his car.</i></b>

8
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:26,963
<b><i>Or his wife.</i></b>

9
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:36,347
<b><i>For the sunglasses people,
they get to do anything they want.</i></b>

10
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,433
<b><i>They go on all sorts of missions.</i></b>

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,269
<b><i>They got cool hair, cool clothes.</i></b>

12
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:46,524
<b><i>I mean, laws aren't really laws to them.
They're more like mild suggestions.</i></b>

13
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,444
<b><i>Like, I don't think
he's gonna return that car.</i></b>

14
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,321
<b><i>Or that nice lady.</i></b>

15
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,589
<b><i>See what I mean? Hero.</i></b>

16
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:29,067

21
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,417
<b><i>What more could a guy want?</i></b>

22
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,002
<b><i>Sunday should be warm and sunny</i></b>

23
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:49,712
<b><i>with just a scattering of drive-bys.</i></b>

24
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,257
<b><i>Great day for the beach,
but not Hitman's Beach,</i></b>

25
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,342
<b><i>which will be mined and sprayed
with high-calibre fire</i></b>

26

<b><i>And every morning,</i></b>

28
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,098
<b><i>I start my day
with the most delicious coffee</i></b>

29
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,225
<b><i>in the whole, wide, whole world.</i></b>

30
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,852
<b>Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.</b>

31
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,311
<b>You know it. Mmm.</b>

32
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:07,856
<b>Mmm!</b>

33
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,275
<b>That is unexpectedly hot.</b>

34
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,818
<b>Jeez, that's good.</b>

35
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,863
<b>It's like losing my virginity,

<b>Thank you for making this
with such love.</b>

37
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,410
<b>You're welcome.</b>

38
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:21,619
<b>Officer Johnny!</b>

39
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:22,829
<b>Have a good one, Guy.</b>

40
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,790
<b>Don't have a good day,

41
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,084
<b>Hold the fudge.</b>

42
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,963
<b>You mean to tell me that nobody snapped
up those bad boys? Today is the day.</b>

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,465
<b>- Like every other day.
- I'll be back for those.</b>

44
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,140
<b>Oh! So close.</b>

45
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:45,560
<b>Mmm! This is the greatest cup of coffee
of all time.</b>

46
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,061
<b>I wanna write a song about it.</b>

47
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:49,022
<b>I wanna dance to that song with my body.</b>

48
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,189
<b>I love my life.</b>

49
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,025
<b>There's something about finding
your lane and just staying in it.</b>

50
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,777
<b>That's why they call 'em comfort zones,
they're so damn comfortable.</b>

51
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,363
<b>Oh, Joe!</b>

52
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:00,909
<b>Mondays, am I right, Joe?</b>

53
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,077
<b>- You said it, Guy.
- Yeah.</b>

54

00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,881
<b>Thank you.</b>

58
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,049
<b>Take care.</b>

59
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,885
<b><i>Except one thing.</i></b>

60
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,346
<b>Seem happy.</b>

61
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,640
<b>Oh, come on, don't worry
about that, Guy. You gonna find someone.</b>

62
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,308
<b>Oh, it's okay, Bud.</b>

63
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,852
<b>Feel like I've been looking
for her forever, you know?</b>

64
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:29,520
<b>Maybe it's not meant to be.</b>

65
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,105
<b>Everybody down on the ground!</b>

66
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:39,989
<b>I know the woman I'm looking for.</b>

67
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,532
<b>Oh, let me guess.</b>

68
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,284
<b>- Woman with an offbeat sense of humour.
- Sense of humour.</b>

69
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:44,786
<b>An obsession
with feel-good diva pop.</b>

70
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:45,870
<b>Diva pop. Yes, that's her.</b>

71
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:47,956
<b>She's rented space in my brain
and she won't move out.</b>

72
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,124
<b>And you know what?
I don't want her to.</b>

73
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,710
<b>Well, guess what?
She won't move either in or out.</b>

74
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:54,504
<b>You know why?
'Cause she doesn't exist.</b>

75
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,631
<b>- She's just a fantasy. It's a fantasy.
- That's cruel. You're cruel.</b>

76
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,257
<b>- You're being rotten right now. Rotten.
- I'm being real.</b>

77
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:01,427
<b>Nobody try to be a hero.
This will all be over soon.</b>

78
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,347
<b>So how about it?
Beers on the beach after work?</b>

79
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:06,432
<b>Of course we're going for beers
on the beach after work.</b>

80
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:07,809
<b>That makes me so happy.</b>

81
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:08,893
<b>Me too.</b>

82
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,073
<b>What have you got?</b>

83
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,909
<b>Proof of a secret level.
That's what you're looking for, right?</b>

84
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,661
<b>You got a video or a screen grab?</b>

85
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,496
<b>Nope. But I know who does.</b>

86
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,873
<b>Wanna know what I do to people
who waste my time?</b>

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,459
<b>Oh, wow. Ooh, someone wants to play.</b>

88
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,420
<b>Hey, you really British,
or is that an accent filter?</b>

89
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,213
<b>'Cause maybe we could meet up later.</b>

90
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,925
<b>I don't have a burning desire
to see your mum's basement, thanks.</b>

91
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,385
<b>Got jokes, huh?</b>

92
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:44,929
<b>Well, I got a map,
shows the location of his stash house.</b>

93
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:49,225
<b>Don't know how you'll get in, but if
you do, clip 56 might interest you.</b>

94
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,811
<b>Now, I got a question.</b>

95
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,521
<b>What's so special
about this video clip anyway?</b>

96
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,733
<b>What's special is I kill people
who ask questions about it.</b>

97
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,609
<b>Mmm, I see. Fun.
Yeah, that's fun.</b>

98
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:03,406
<b>Damn, girl, you're so feisty.</b>

99
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,200
<b>But, seriously, is it loot
or is it just the experience?</b>

100
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,661
<b>Those are questions.</b>

101
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,041
<b>Did you see the sneakers
on that last robber?</b>

102
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,250
<b>The 2:30?</b>

103
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,877
<b>No, the 4:00.</b>

104
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,130
<b>The three-quarter high-top,
gorgeous foam soles.</b>

105
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:21,132
<b>I could barely feel it
when he stepped on my face.</b>

106
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,592
<b>- Oh, man.
- Wow.</b>

107
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,261
<b>Life in the big city.
Ain't nothing like it.</b>

108
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,429
<b>Give it to me!</b>

109
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,889
<b>Looks like rain.</b>

110
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,099
<b>Has anyone seen my cat?</b>

111
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,937
<b>You know something, Guy,
people say it all the time, like,</b>

112
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:38,274
<b>"Guy can take a shoe to the face
better than anybody I know."</b>

113
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,525
<b>I mean, when you put it on there,</b>

114
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:40,651
<b>you act like
it's not a shoe in your face.</b>

115
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,747
<b>Don't have a good day,
have a great day.</b>

116
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,082
<b>Love that song.</b>

117
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,920
<b>That's a new one.</b>

118
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,059
<b>Hey!</b>

119
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,020
<b>That's her.</b>

00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,605
<b>Her who?</b>

121
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,315
<b>That's my dream girl, Buddy.</b>

122
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,150
<b>She exists.</b>

123
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,737
<b>- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</b>

124
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,989
<b>Wait, man. She's wearing sunglasses.</b>

125
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,658
<b>So?</b>

126
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,118
<b>Whatcha mean "so?"</b>

127
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,245
<b>So, people with sunglasses don't talk
to people like us.</b>

128
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,413
<b>- You know that!
- I gotta try.</b>

129

<b>Medium coffee, cream, two sugars.</b>

153
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:07,506
<b>Actually, I think I'd like

154
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,093
<b>Ooh. "Cappuccino."
I enjoy saying that.</b>

155
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,596
<b>It's like a waterfall made of letters.</b>

156
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:14,847
<b>Excuse me?</b>

157
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,641
<b>I'd like to try a cappuccino.</b>

158

<b>Please.</b>

159
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:20,311
<b>But you get a medium coffee,

160
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,146
<b>That's what you get.
That's what everyone gets.</b>

161

165
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,408
<b>Whatever. Right? Yeah?</b>

166
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:38,996
<b>Hi.</b>

167
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,459
<b>Ha! I'm just keeping you on your toes.</b>

168
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,712
<b>Coffee, cream, two sugars, please.</b>

169
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,714
<b>I'm joking.</b>

170
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:50,633
<b>Just keeping you on your toes.
I was kidding.</b>

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,801
<b>He was just kidding!</b>

172
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:55,304
<b>Oh, you think I'd deprive myself
of your baristic artistry?</b>

173
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,555
<b>No way, no how.</b>

174
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:59,267
<b>Mmm. That's hot.</b>

175
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,895
<b>It's like Jesus

176

<b>but, right before he finished,
he finally told my dad,</b>

<b>Thank you so much.
Officer Johnny!</b>

179
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:13,489
<b>Have a good one, Guy.</b>

<b>Don't have a good day...</b>

182
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,793
<b>...have a great day, I guess.</b>

183
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,088
<b>Okay. Good day to you.</b>

184

187
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,040
<b>We've been over this.</b>

188
00:11:04,123 --> 00:11:05,958
<b>You tried to talk to her yesterday,
it didn't work.</b>

189
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,543
<b>It will never work.</b>

190
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,919
<b>She's wearing sunglasses.</b>

191
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,504
<b>We don't mess
with the sunglasses people.</b>

192
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,590
<b>Maybe I'll get
some sunglasses of my own.</b>

193
00:11:12,757 --> 00:11:13,758
<b>What? What are you talking about?
You can't do that.</b>

194
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,384
<b>Oh, my God. What am I doing?</b>

195
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:17,219

<b>Yeah, exactly.</b>

253
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,143
<b>I tried that, but I,</b>

254
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,770
<b>I can't trace him.</b>

265
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:19,169
<b>Uh, full body moustache, hot pink.
You should be very afraid.</b>

266
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,754
<b>I'm terrified.</b>

267
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:22,381
<b>Let's do this.</b>

268
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,751
<b>Seriously, man.</b>

269
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,296
<b>I'm just being honest, I think

<b>Nice skin.</b>

00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,993
<b>Thank you. That's sweet.</b>

285
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,370
<b>How'd you get it?</b>

286
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:37,873
<b>Well, uh, mostly genetics,
I think. I'm pretty lucky.</b>

287
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,583
<b>I have naturally dewy skin.</b>

288

<b>Listen up, Neutrogena.</b>

289
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,212
<b>You know you can't go around

290
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,380
<b>And another thing.</b>

291
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:45,881
<b>- You can't hack the NPC avatars.
- No, sir!</b>

292
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,216
<b>- It screws up the mission load...
- Screws it up!</b>

293
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:48,550
<b>...and it makes the game look bad.</b>

294
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,968
<b>- Horrible!
- Yeah.</b>

295
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,804
<b>I got, like, 5% of that.</b>

296

<b>Lose the skin!</b>

297

298
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,684
<b>How am I supposed to get rid of my skin?</b>

299
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,851
<b>Take it off, man.</b>

300
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,228
<b>Just take it off.
What are you doing?</b>

301
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:00,437
<b>- What?
- Seriously.</b>

302
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:01,980
<b>- The whole thing. The face, the outfit.
- How?</b>

303
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,273
<b>- Everything. Ditch it.
- Take it off.</b>

304
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,692
<b>If you don't, we're gonna kill you.</b>

305
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,318
<b>- Why?
- And we're gonna keep killing you.</b>

306
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:07,528
<b>Still why?</b>

307
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:08,946
<b>Until we do find out who you are,</b>

308
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:10,698
<b>and then we're gonna ban you for life.</b>

309
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,159
<b>Okay. No, no.
Okay, I want to comply.</b>

310
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,453
<b>I just find the order of those threats
very confusing.</b>

311
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,205
<b>- Somebody's about to get shot.
- Light him up!</b>

312
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:36,765
<b>No.</b>

313
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,110
<b>Come on, Blue Shirt.</b>

314
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,841
<b>Oh! Didn't see that one coming.
Did you see that one coming?</b>

315
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,134
<b>Scared me a little bit.</b>

316
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,761
<b>We're coming for you, Blue Shirt!</b>

317
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,220
<b>Coming to get ya.</b>

318
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,889
<b>We're coming to get ya.</b>

319
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:20,517
<b>Wait! Wait!</b>

320
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:22,060
<b>I can explain everything.</b>

321
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:25,939
<b>I found these glasses
and then I can see things now.</b>

322
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:28,609
<b>Things that-- Whoa, whoa.
Things that aren't there.</b>

323
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,486
<b>Except they are there.</b>

324
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,906
<b>I know that sounds crazy, but it's true!</b>

325
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,993
<b>You can run, Blue Shirt,
but you cannot hide.</b>

326
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,579
<b>Come on, Blue Shirt.
You can't escape the rabbit.</b>

327
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,790
<b>We're apex predators.</b>

328
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:46,543
<b>All we do is bone and brawl
and slit throats.</b>

329
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,254
<b>Too high! Too high!</b>

330
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,808
<b>Oh, you wanna play, Blue Shirt?
Watch this.</b>

331
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,853
<b>I tire of these games, Keys. It's time
I went god-mode on this beyotch.</b>

332
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,104
<b>Okay, bring it.</b>

333
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,023
<b>Oh, it's brung. Go, go, go, go, go.</b>

334
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,915
<b>I'm so, so good at this.</b>

335
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,008
<b>Time's up, bank teller!</b>

336
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,073
<b>Nope!</b>

337
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:23,765
<b>I can't die!</b>

338
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,517
<b>I'm never gonna die!</b>

339
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,602
<b>Whoo!</b>

340
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:29,855
<b>And that was the heartbreaking story
of Blue Shirt Guy.</b>

341
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,106
<b>The end.</b>

342
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,317
<b>- Doesn't make sense.
- What?</b>

343
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,526
<b>I just checked the server stats.</b>

344
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,070
<b>We killed Blue Shirt and the number
of players online didn't change.</b>

345
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,280
<b>It's just a glitch, man.</b>

346
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,489
<b>- It's not a big deal.
- I know, I know.</b>

347
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,116
<b>It just seems like
that's something new, you know?</b>

348
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,535
<b>Keys, I know what you're thinking, okay?
You should not talk to Antwan.</b>

349
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,370
<b>I just think it's important
to be transparent, okay?</b>

350
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,455
<b>Uh-uh. No.</b>

351
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,249
<b>Antwan is deep in the sequel launch.
He's either not gonna care</b>

352
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,336
<b>or he's gonna get pissed
and then he's gonna blame us.</b>

353
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,339
<b>So, I don't know what you haven't
figured out about the whole situation.</b>

354
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:59,760
<b>Also, aren't you some kinda MIT genius,
indie game designer?</b>

355
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,429
<b>What are you doing down here dealing
with complaints?</b>

356
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:06,433
<b>That, Mouser, is a long and pathetic
story involving failed dreams,</b>

357
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,685
<b>desperation,
and a mountain of college debt.</b>

358
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:10,479
<b>You do not wanna hear about that.</b>

359
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,022
<b>You're absolutely right.</b>

360
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:16,360
<b>That story sounds horrible and boring
and full of white privilege.</b>

361
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,278
<b>Don't talk to Antwan.</b>

362
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:25,494
<b><i>We never dreamt
this would've happened.</i></b>

363
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,246
<b>I mean, <i>Life Itself,</i> it's essentially
a fishbowl game.</b>

364
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,000
<b>People aren't playing it,
they're watching it grow.</b>

365
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,835
<b>It's a strictly observational experience</b>

366
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:37,673
<b>where computer generated characters
interact and evolve.</b>

367
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,633
<b>I thought we'd be lucky to give it away.</b>

368
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,262
<b>That's what's so charming about Keys,
he's clueless about his own genius.</b>

369
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,056
<b>Uh, no, Millie is the genius.</b>

370
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,685
<b>Uh, she built the AI engine
from the ground up.</b>

371
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,186
<b>So, to get a little personal,</b>

372
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,271
<b>what's the thing that gets you up
in the morning?</b>

373
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,857
<b>Medium coffee,
cream, two sugars.</b>

374
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,360
<b>What's the other thing?</b>

375
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:00,904
<b>Oh, yeah.
An insatiable thirst for validation.</b>

376
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:02,531
<b>- She's not kidding.
- I'm not.</b>

377
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,865
<b>How about you?</b>

378
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,450
<b>- Code.
- Code?</b>

379
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:06,535
<b>- Code.
- Code, yeah.</b>

380
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,619
<b>There we go.</b>

381
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,454
<b>'Cause it's not just zeros
and ones, it's hidden messages.</b>

382
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,624
<b>I like to think of myself, actually,
as not a code writer, but an author.</b>

383
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:17,170
<b>I just use zeros and ones instead
of words 'cause words will let you down.</b>

384
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:21,675
<b>But zeros and ones, never.
Zeros and ones are as cool as shit.</b>

385
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,468
<b>- He's not kidding.
- I'm not.</b>

386
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,220
<b>Now, I've gotta ask.</b>

387
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,597
<b>There is a lot of chemistry between
the two of you.</b>

388
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,600
<b>- Has this evolved into more than--
- No.</b>

389
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,103
<b>- No way. No. It's strictly platonic.
- No, no, no. We're friends.</b>

390
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,354
<b>- We're like best friends.
- Friendship.</b>

391
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,106
<b>And now your game
is gonna be released by Soonami,</b>

392
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:37,691
<b>one of the biggest publishers
in the world.</b>

393
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,693
<b><i>- It's crazy, actually.
- It is, yeah.</i></b>

394
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,612
<b><i>It does seem a little bit
like an unlikely pairing, though.</i></b>

395
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,990
<b><i>Yeah,
I didn't totally get it either.</i></b>

396
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,659
<b><i>But Millie's got a real instinct
for these things.</i></b>

397
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,077
<b><i>Antwan is a genius.</i></b>

398
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:52,581
<b><i>He's brash and obnoxious,
but he's really good at what he does.</i></b>

399
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,916
<b><i>It's a chance for our work
to be seen by a wider audience.</i></b>

400
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,044
<b>- God, those two were young and dumb.
- Jeez.</b>

401
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,670
<b>So we're breaking and entering now?</b>

402
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,758
<b>How does it feel working for a galactic
black hole of frozen shit?</b>

403
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,885
<b>You have to leave. I can't talk to you.</b>

404
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:06,595
<b>Aw, shame will have that effect.</b>

405
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,388
<b>No, Millie. I mean I can't talk to you.</b>

406
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:11,016
<b>I can't even see you. I'm literally
focusing on background objects</b>

407
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:13,185
<b>because looking at your lips move
violates my NDA</b>

408
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,603
<b>and it could get me fired.</b>

409
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,272
<b>Aw, fired by Antwan,
the guy who stole our work?</b>

410
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,107
<b>No, he bought it and then he shelved it.</b>

411
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,319
<b>All right? You're living in the past.
You are stuck. You gotta move on.</b>

412
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,570
<b>How can I move on?</b>

413
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,113
<b>How can you?</b>

414
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,116
<b>Antwan swiped our AI engine
to use in his dumb shooter.</b>

415
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:31,745
<b>Did he, Millie?
Because, honestly, I'm not so sure.</b>

416
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:34,456
<b>Our game was complex
and beautiful and interesting.</b>

417
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,876
<b>And <i>Free City,</i> it may be popular but
it's so idiotic, it makes me wanna cry.</b>

418
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:39,878
<b>Then stop defending him
and help me beat his ass.</b>

419
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,214
<b>- Millie, I'm--
- Come on, Keys, he stole from us.</b>

420
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:43,715
<b>And now he's lying about it</b>

421
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:46,176
<b>so he doesn't have to give us the credit

422
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,344
<b>Millie--</b>

423
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,930
<b>I found a clue.
It's on a clip in a gamer's stash house.</b>

424
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:53,475
<b>All I need from you
is to get me in there.</b>

425
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,894
<b>Millie, I care about you</b>

426
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,025
<b>but you need to leave.</b>

427
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,369
<b>Today is gonna be different, Goldie.</b>

428
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,764
<b>What are we lookin' at?</b>

429
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,601
<b>Who are you?</b>

430
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,977
<b>Okay, okay. Okay.</b>

431
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,730
<b>We ran into each other the other day,
you were humming that great song.</b>

432
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:22,898
<b>Oh, yeah.</b>

433
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,650
<b>I thought you were an NPC.
How did you find me?</b>

434
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:28,778
<b>I waited outside by the murder train,</b>

435
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,197
<b>then I followed you.</b>

436
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,281
<b>Shit!</b>

437
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,006
<b>Can I come with you?</b>

438
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,508
<b>Yes?</b>

439
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,179
<b>Holy hell, what just happened?</b>

440
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:56,765
<b>What just happened
is you almost blew my mission.</b>

441
00:25:57,098 --> 00:26:00,060
<b>No, I mean, how did we get from there
to wherever this is?</b>

442
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,478
<b>You mean the portal gun?</b>

443
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,563
<b>Portal gun?
That sounds expensive.</b>

444
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,857
<b>Wow, you are a special kind of noob.</b>

445
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:07,150
<b>Thank you. You too.</b>

446
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,318
<b>Turn around.</b>

447
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,403
<b>Okay.</b>

448
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,741
<b>Oh.</b>

449
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,372
<b>Is this the North Pole?</b>

450
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,957
<b>Listen, dude.</b>

451
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,667
<b>- Guy.
- Guy. Whatever.</b>

452

<b>Mmm.</b>

754
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:53,067
<b>How good is that?</b>

755
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:54,318
<b>You can taste it?</b>

756
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:57,905
<b>Taste it? It's like my tongue

<b>- Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.</b>

<b>Coffee used to be my favourite food,</b>

<b>What?</b>

761
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,878

- Yeah.</b>

763

- Yeah. I know a joke.</b>

767

<b>Yes. Definitely.</b>

820
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,153
<b>Maybe in the real world.</b>

821
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,405
<b>What?</b>

822
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:28,240
<b>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</b>

823
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,783
<b>- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.</b>

00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,953
<b>Bye, Molotov.</b>

825
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,957
<b>Hey, my real name is Millie.</b>

00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,962
<b>My real name continues to be Guy.</b>

<b>Millie, open up! Millie, it's me,

828
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,766
<b>Millie! It's me, open up!</b>

829
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,810
<b>- What?
- You were right.</b>

830
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,229
<b>- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.</b>

831
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,815
<b>You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i></b>

832
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:04,693
<b>and, Millie, it works.</b>

833
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,361
<b>Yeah, I know. But we don't have proof.</b>

834
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:08,405
<b>Just forget about that
for one second.</b>

835
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:10,782
<b>I'm saying that our game, <i>Life Itself,</i></b>

836
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,744
<b>where characters would grow
and change and feel real...</b>

837
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,995
<b>- Yeah?
- ...worked.</b>

838
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:16,788
<b>- Keys.
- The AI worked.</b>

839
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:20,292
<b>It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is
so realistic and people love it so much.</b>

840
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,336
<b>And of course it doesn't look the same.</b>

841
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:25,297
<b>There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,</b>

842
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:28,258
<b>all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.</b>

843
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:32,846
<b>But the underlying code in the game
is the same. Our code.</b>

844
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,765
<b>And Guy, I mean, he has evolved
way further</b>

845
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:35,849
<b>than we thought was even possible.</b>

846
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:38,352
<b>Wait, are you talking about the hacker
in the NPC skin?</b>

847
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:41,938
<b>Millie, I'm talking about the fact
that Blue Shirt Guy...</b>

848
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:43,106
<b>Yeah?</b>

849
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,691
<b>...is not a player.</b>

850
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,944
<b>He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.</b>

851
00:49:48,111 --> 00:49:50,280
<b>I mean, hell, technically, he is alive.</b>

852
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:54,493
<b>He is the first real
artificial intelligence.</b>

853
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,704
<b>- No! No.
- I know.</b>

854
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,247
<b>- No, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.</b>

855
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:00,791
<b>- Guy? My Guy?
- Guy.</b>

856
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,125
<b>- One who has been--
- Your Guy?</b>

857
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:03,418
<b>- Holy--
- This is a good thing.</b>

858
00:50:03,585 --> 00:50:05,087
<b>No, it's really bad.</b>

859
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:08,423
<b>Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.</b>

860
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,925
<b>We did it, Mills.</b>

861
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,971
<b>We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.</b>

862
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:18,058
<b>Okay? Did you know
that the NPCs have private lives?</b>

863
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,103
<b>One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.</b>

864
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,271
<b>I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.</b>

865
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,357
<b>I can't even froth my own oat milk
in the morning.</b>

866
00:50:25,816 --> 00:50:28,068
<b>And the Bombshell character in the game</b>

867
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,946
<b>wrote a memoir

<b>of gender roles, the patriarchy.</b>

869
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,783
<b>It's a little preachy in parts

870
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:35,951
<b>Millie, we have to celebrate!</b>

871
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,869
<b>- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?</b>

872

- No, I let him kiss me!</b>

873
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,500
<b>So, yeah.</b>

874
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,422
<b>I'm sorry, wait, you let who kiss you?</b>

875
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:49,631
<b>Guy.</b>

876
00:50:50,757 --> 00:50:51,758
<b>Guy?</b>

877
00:50:51,842 --> 00:50:56,555
<b>The first time I kiss a non-toxic guy
in, like, forever</b>

878

879
00:50:59,516 --> 00:51:00,851
<b>Uh, there's not a button for that.</b>

880
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:03,186

881
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,813
<b>- Okay.
- Yeah.</b>

882

- Why is it so hot?</b>

883
00:51:07,357 --> 00:51:08,525
<b>...and surprisingly curious.</b>

884

886
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,324
<b>- can you just stop saying it like that?
- And then you thought that would be--</b>

887
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,368
<b>Because you have got to meet him, Keys.</b>

888
00:51:18,535 --> 00:51:21,496
<b>He's funny, and he's sweet,

889
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:23,915
<b>Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.</b>

890
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:27,544
<b>Also, Millie, food for thought,

- Really.</b>

<b>Millie, put all that aside.</b>

<b>Weird or not,

897
00:51:40,307 --> 00:51:41,767

<b>He's lying.
He lied about using our code,</b>

901
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:50,233
<b>he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.</b>

902
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,735
<b>I think he's lying about <i>Free City 1.</i></b>

903
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:52,861
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

904
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:56,865
<b>Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location...</b>

905
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,075
<b>...I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.</b>

906
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,660
<b><i>Free City 2</i> is not an update...</b>

907
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,120
<b>- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.</b>

908
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:03,914
<b>So when <i>Free City 2</i> launches
on Monday--</b>

909
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,375
<b>Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our code,
everything, will be deleted.</b>

910
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,794
<b>He can't do that.</b>

911
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,130
<b>I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.</b>

912
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:16,927
<b>We're screwed.</b>

913
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:19,221
<b>Maybe not.</b>

914
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:21,848
<b>If we can find our original build
in the game,</b>

915
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,684
<b>it'll prove that Antwan used our code
without properly licensing it.</b>

916
00:52:24,851 --> 00:52:27,020
<b>And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.</b>

917
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,438
<b>We have 48 hours.</b>

918
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,023
<b>I've looked, Keys. You know I have.</b>

919
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,316
<b>I know you have.</b>

920
00:52:31,483 --> 00:52:33,860
<b>But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,</b>

921
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:35,529
<b>maybe he can help?</b>

922
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:37,447
<b>That would mean I'd have to tell him.</b>

923
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:40,992
<b>Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.</b>

924
00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:43,620
<b>His whole world's about to end.</b>

925
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,498
<b>Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?</b>

926
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:50,752
<b>- Here you go.
- Thank you.</b>

927
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:52,921
<b>- You got it.
- Guy?</b>

928
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,339
<b>Hey! Hi!</b>

929
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:55,799
<b>Guy, we need to talk.</b>

930
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,552
<b>What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?</b>

931
00:52:58,718 --> 00:52:59,719
<b>British.</b>

932
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,763
<b>I think I know an Australian accent
when I see one.</b>

933
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,015
<b>I turned off the accent filter.</b>

934
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:06,560
<b>This is me.</b>

935
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,019
<b>Good.</b>

936
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:10,230
<b>Look, I have to tell you something
really important.</b>

937
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:11,481
<b>Are you married?</b>

938
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:12,566
<b>No.</b>

939
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:15,068
<b>Oh, God.</b>

940
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:18,071
<b>That would have been, like,
the worst thing ever.</b>

941
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,865
<b>Maybe not the worst thing.</b>

942
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:21,449
<b>Huh.</b>

943
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,159
<b>I have to show you something.</b>

944
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,370
<b>Okay.</b>

945
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:31,793
<b>Wow!</b>

946
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,920

<b>There is no easy way to say this,

- Boop-boop.</b>

<b>Yes.</b>

<b>- This is kind of funeral...

<b>Yeah. So what?</b>

1050
00:59:30,944 --> 00:59:32,820
<b>But if you're not real,</b>

1051
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,490

1056

<b>Now, if that's not real,

<b>His name is Luigi.</b>

1073
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:48,146
<b>So, if you took some time

1074
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:49,939
<b>maybe he wouldn't turn on you so quick.</b>

1075
01:00:50,106 --> 01:00:53,401
<b>I need a video clip,

01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:09,490
<b><i>But I'll tell you this,
he's got me thinkin'</i></b>

1194
01:05:09,574 --> 01:05:11,242
<b><i>about NPCs and how I play the game.</i></b>

1195
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:13,911
<b><i>The game wasn't even made
for someone like this,</i></b>

1196
01:05:13,995 --> 01:05:15,538
<b><i>for a player to be a good guy.</i></b>

1197
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:16,872
<b><i>He's also a really cute guy.</i></b>

1198
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:19,709
<b><i>And not just the face, you know,
like, the whole thing</i>.</b>

1199
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,752
<b><i>And, honestly, it's got me realising,</i></b>

1200
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,422
<b><i>maybe we've been thinking
about NPCs wrong this whole time.</i></b>

1201
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:26,465
<b><i>I think Blue Shirt Guy's
like a symbol, you know?</i></b>

1202
01:05:26,632 --> 01:05:28,342
<b><i>Like, maybe people
can be whatever they want.</i></b>

1203
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,886
<b><i>He's like an icon.
Is that the right word?</i></b>

1204
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,930
<b><i>Like, he reminds us of what's possible.</i></b>

1205
01:05:33,097 --> 01:05:34,432
<b><i>Also, he's, like, crazy hot.</i></b>

1206
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:37,602
<b><i>Oh, my God, totally.
I'd hit those pixels hard.</i></b>

1207
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,020
<b><i>We should all be

1208
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,521
<b>Maybe we just stop the killing.</b>

1209
01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:42,898
<b>He's dead! You hear me?</b>

1210
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:44,609
<b>The guy, put him up here.</b>

1211
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:47,069
<b>Put him up here on the screen.
Put him on the screen.</b>

1212
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:50,781
<b>Make me see him. There he is.</b>

1213
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:53,492
<b>Yes. There he is, the little do-gooder.</b>

he would meet "the girl of his dreams".</b>

1333
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:40,232
<b><i>So I had to base this girl

1342

<b>What? I don't want
anything inside of me.</b>

1361
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,421

01:13:49,802 --> 01:13:51,470
<b>No, and I need you to remember it.</b>

1366
01:13:51,637 --> 01:13:53,639
<b>Why have you been following me
and how do you know my name?</b>

1367
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:54,723
<b>Put these on.</b>

1368
01:13:54,807 --> 01:13:56,350
<b>I don't have to do anything
that I don't wanna do.</b>

1370
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:00,479
<b>Okay. Okay. Fine.</b>

1371
01:14:05,234 --> 01:14:07,277
<b>What is that?</b>

1372
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:09,154
<b>What are these?
Trick glasses or something?</b>

1373

1376
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:17,121
<b>Can you please just let me go?</b>

1377
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:18,705
<b>I mean, I haven't really even
seen your face.</b>

1378
01:14:18,872 --> 01:14:20,165
<b>I mean, I've seen the general area,</b>

1379
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:21,834
<b>but I'm not really good
with descriptive words.</b>

1380
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,377
<b>Not really good with words in general.</b>

1381
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:26,088
<b>- Screw it.
- What? Oh!</b>

1382
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:05,252
<b>I remember.</b>

1383
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:07,713
<b>Welcome back.</b>

1384
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:11,300
<b>No. I remember everything.</b>

1385
01:15:12,092 --> 01:15:13,093
<b>Come with me.</b>

1386
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:17,014
<b>I do this every day so much,
I'd forgotten why.</b>

1387
01:15:20,392 --> 01:15:21,894
<b>Do you see that?</b>

1388
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:23,520
<b>Right there.</b>

1389
01:15:24,146 --> 01:15:25,564
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

1390
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:28,483
<b>Oh, my God!</b>

1391
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:32,196
<b>Antwan hid our original build past
the horizon, making it invisible...</b>

1392
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,531
<b>but he forgot to scrub the reflections.</b>

1393
01:15:35,616 --> 01:15:37,326
<b>It's still out there, Guy.
We just can't see it.</b>

1394
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:40,120
<b>If we can get there,
that is the evidence we need.</b>

1395
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:42,998
<b>You can't go past the water line.
I tried.</b>

1396
01:15:43,165 --> 01:15:44,208
<b>We need help.</b>

1397
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,502
<b>Antwan found a way
to hide it in plain sight</b>

1398
01:15:47,586 --> 01:15:49,588
<b>in the one place no one can even get to.</b>

1399
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:50,756
<b><i>I can't even believe</i></b>

1400

<b><i>he's smart enough to be this diabolical.</i></b>

1401
01:15:51,924 --> 01:15:53,425
<b>Keys, I need you to focus.</b>

1402
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:57,095
<b>Okay. So, the reflection shows the build
past the southern horizon.</b>

1403
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,348
<b>But the game physics
won't allow you past the beach.</b>

1404
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:02,100
<b>But you think you can find a way
to get us past the collision mesh?</b>

1405
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:03,185
<b><i>We're gonna need a bridge.</i></b>

1406
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:05,520
<b>You just get to Hitman's Beach
and I'll figure out the rest.</b>

1407
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:06,897
<b>And, Millie,</b>

1408
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:08,649
<b><i>be careful.</i></b>

1409
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:10,734
<b>Antwan may be an asshole,
but he's not stupid.</b>

1410
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:13,445
<b>He'll figure out what you're up to and
he'll throw everything he's got at you.</b>

1411
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:14,613
<b>You're right.</b>

1412
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:18,033
<b><i>Um, hi, Millie,
and other person I can't see,</i></b>

1413
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,493
<b><i>w-- I have an idea.</i></b>

1414
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,411
<b><i>What if he has nothing to throw?</i></b>

1415
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:26,124
<b>Everyone! Gather round!</b>

1416
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:28,961
<b>Thank you for coming.</b>

1417
01:16:29,795 --> 01:16:31,004
<b>Now, you know me, I'm Guy.</b>

1418
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:32,673
<b>Hi, Guy.</b>

1419
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,341
<b>Hi.</b>

1420
01:16:35,217 --> 01:16:37,970
<b>What I'm about to say
may be hard to understand.</b>

1421
01:16:38,887 --> 01:16:40,264
<b>Really hard to understand.</b>

1422
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:45,227
<b>But, are you sick
of living in the background?</b>

1423
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:48,313
<b>Aren't you sick of being shot at?</b>

1424
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:49,398
<b>Enough.</b>

1425
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:51,108
<b>- Taken hostage?
- No more.</b>

1426
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,484
<b>- Run over?
- We done with that.</b>

1427
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,736
<b>Robbed? Stabbed?
Used as a human shield?</b>

1428
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,280
<b>We are tired of being stabbed!</b>

1429
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:57,614
<b>- Buddy!
- Sorry.</b>

1430
01:16:57,781 --> 01:16:59,408
<b>What are you trying to say, Guy?</b>

1431
01:16:59,574 --> 01:17:02,536
<b>I'm tryin' to say that things in
this city don't have to be this way.</b>

1432
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:03,745
<b>Things can be different.</b>

1433
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:04,955
<b>Different how?</b>

1434
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:07,541
<b>For starters,
you can put your arms down.</b>

1435
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:08,625
<b>Yeah.</b>

1436
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:13,380
<b>There you go. You got it. Yeah.</b>

1437
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:15,048
<b>Keep pushing. There you go.</b>

1438
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,092
<b>- Breathe through it. There you go.
- Do it. Do it. Do it.</b>

1439
01:17:17,259 --> 01:17:18,635
<b>- No, not gonna happen.
- Nope.</b>

1440
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:19,886
<b>That feels unnatural.</b>

1441
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:22,222
<b>I mean, what about when someone
runs in with a gun?</b>

1442
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:24,725
<b>Having my arms up
is just a real time saver.</b>

1443
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:29,604
<b>Except, what if the guy
with the gun doesn't come?</b>

1444
01:17:29,771 --> 01:17:30,814
<b>- What?
- What?</b>

1445
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:32,566
<b>There's always a guy with a gun.</b>

1446
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:34,276
<b>So many guys with guns.</b>

1447
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:38,113
<b>People, what if our world
doesn't have to be so scary?</b>

1448
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,199
<b>What if we can change it?</b>

1449
01:17:41,366 --> 01:17:46,246
<b>Millie! How many times a day
are the banks robbed in your world?</b>

1450
01:17:46,413 --> 01:17:47,831
<b>Hardly ever, Guy.</b>

1451
01:17:47,956 --> 01:17:49,791
<b>What about corpses, Millie?</b>

1452
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:50,959
<b>- What?
- You see a lot of those?</b>

1453
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:52,461
<b>How many an hour?</b>

1454
01:17:52,627 --> 01:17:54,046
<b>None per hour, Guy.</b>

1455
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:55,547
<b>What about gun violence?</b>

1456
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,758
<b>See a lot of gun violence in your world?</b>

1457
01:17:57,924 --> 01:18:01,094
<b>Actually, that's a big problem, Guy.
It's a massive problem.</b>

1458
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,014
<b>I didn't see that coming.</b>

1459
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:05,432
<b>It's true. It really sucks.</b>

1460
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:10,854
<b>The point is, we don't have
to be spectators to our own lives.</b>

1461
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:13,398
<b>We can be whatever we want.</b>

1462
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:15,067
<b>We can't all be you, Guy.</b>

1463
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:16,526
<b>That's not true.</b>

1464
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:21,031
<b>What's inside of me
is inside of you, too.</b>

1465
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,115
<b>What?</b>

1466
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:25,160
<b>It's inside of each and every
one of you. You're growing.</b>

1467
01:18:25,327 --> 01:18:28,455
<b>I need more in my life than drip coffee.
I want to make...</b>

1468
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:29,623
<b>A cappuccino.</b>

1469
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,375
<b>...a goddamn difference in the world.</b>

1470
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,709
<b>Much, much better.</b>

1471
01:18:32,876 --> 01:18:33,877
<b>And a green tea boba.</b>

1472
01:18:34,002 --> 01:18:35,587
<b>- Holy shit!
- That's right!</b>

1473
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,172
<b>You go, girl.</b>

1474
01:18:37,339 --> 01:18:38,423
<b>Oh, my God, you're amazing!</b>

1475
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,217
<b>If I could just make it out
past that water,</b>

1476
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:42,386
<b>there's a world out there
where we can be free.</b>

1477
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,554
<b>Where we get to decide who we wanna be.</b>

1478
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,015
<b>Where we can matter.
But we have to fight for it.</b>

1479
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:48,934
<b>We have to fight together.</b>

1480
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:50,394
<b>Yeah!</b>

1481
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,563
<b>You guys have always done
what's expected of you.</b>

1482
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:55,232
<b>But that shit ends today.</b>

1483
01:18:55,357 --> 01:18:56,358
<b>Yeah!</b>

1484
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,610
<b>I don't even know
what's happening right now!</b>

1485
01:18:58,693 --> 01:18:59,694
<b>But I love it!</b>

1486
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:02,614
<b>I love it!</b>

1487
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:04,825
<b>I love it!</b>

1488
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:06,910
<b>I love it, too!
Come on, guys, get in here!</b>

1489
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:09,955
<b>Huddle up! Here's what we're gonna do!
Everyone in!</b>

1490
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:17,879
<b>Everybody get down on the ground!</b>

1491
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:24,010
<b>Hello?</b>

1492
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,514
<b>Where the hell is everybody?</b>

1493
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:30,016
<b>Hello?</b>

1494
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:42,362
<b>Where are all the NPCs?</b>

1495
01:19:51,163 --> 01:19:53,832
<b><i>Look, I've been playing</i>
Free City <i>for, like, 3 years now.</i></b>

1496
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:55,417
<b><i>I've never seen anything like this.</i></b>

1497
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:56,918
<b><i>Up until recently,</i></b>

1498
01:19:57,002 --> 01:19:59,796
<b><i>I don't even know if I'd have noticed
a few NPCs going missing.</i></b>

1499
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,841
<b><i>And I don't know if this is just
some whack Reddit theory</i></b>

1500
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:06,636
<b><i>but some people are saying
that Blue Shirt Guy isn't even a player.</i></b>

1501
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:09,514
<b><i>- That he's actual AI.
- AI?</i></b>

1502
01:20:09,681 --> 01:20:13,143
<b><i>Actual AI. You know, alive.</i></b>

1503
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,562
<b><i>It's why Blue Shirt Guy
is trending everywhere.</i></b>

1504
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:18,607
<b><i>Antwan, if you're watching this,
please fix the game.</i></b>

1505
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:21,067
<b><i>- And most of all, bring back Blue Shirt.</i>
- Oh, my God. My God!</b>

1506
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:22,569
<b>Antwan, you should see this.</b>

1507
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:26,615
<b><i>And you,
you tried to steal it from me</i></b>

1508
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:28,200
<b><i>with that Molotov chick.</i></b>

1509
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:29,284
<b><i>- Her name's Millie.</i>
<i>- Who?</i></b>

1510
01:20:29,367 --> 01:20:30,368
<b><i>Millie.</i></b>

1511
01:20:30,619 --> 01:20:33,580
<b>Got her. Got her!
Got you! Got you!</b>

1512
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:36,291
<b>Mouser! Put him up on the screen.
Now. Put him up.</b>

1513
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,001
<b>That's it. Come on, quicker.</b>

1514
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:39,628
<b>Yes, there he is.</b>

1515
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:43,381
<b>He's joyriding around Free City
with some player called Molotovgirl.</b>

1516
01:20:44,216 --> 01:20:46,384
<b>AKA Millie Rusk.</b>

1517
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:48,595
<b>Millie Rusk?
Isn't that Keys' old partner?</b>

1518
01:20:48,678 --> 01:20:49,679
<b>Yeah.</b>

1519
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:51,973
<b>Also the one who's trying to hit me
with this bogus lawsuit</b>

1520
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,434
<b>'cause she's desperate
for a piece of Soonami Kwan.</b>

1521
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,061
<b>Boot Molotovgirl now.</b>

1522
01:20:56,228 --> 01:21:00,232
<b>I'm trying. I'm trying as hard as I can,
but her account's spoofed.</b>

1523
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:01,399
<b>This woman is exceptional.</b>

1524
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:02,984
<b>Then kill her in the game.</b>

1525
01:21:03,151 --> 01:21:05,862
<b>"What?" Yes, I said that. Kill her.</b>

1526
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:09,366
<b>Throw everything at them, all right?
5 badges, G.</b>

1527
01:21:09,533 --> 01:21:11,034
<b>Yeah, just one problem.</b>

1528
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:12,619
<b>We don't have anything.</b>

1529
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:13,870
<b>Whatchu talking about, Willis?</b>

1530
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:15,539
<b>We don't have any defences.</b>

1531
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:19,042
<b>We don't have police, military,
no nothing.</b>

1532
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:20,752
<b>It's what I've been trying to tell you.</b>

1533
01:21:20,919 --> 01:21:24,422
<b>It's like every NPC went on strike.</b>

1534
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:28,552
<b>Got a tall, half-caf,
double foam oat milk,</b>

1535
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:30,136
<b>matcha latte with cinnamon!</b>

1536
01:21:30,303 --> 01:21:31,555
<b>- That's me.
- Hey.</b>

1537
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:33,014
<b>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</b>

1538
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,307
<b>Cheers.</b>

1539
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,728
<b>Go get 'em, Guy!</b>

1540
01:21:40,438 --> 01:21:42,524
<b>It's like a digital walkout.</b>

1541
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:44,776
<b>No, it's not.</b>

1542
01:21:44,943 --> 01:21:46,861
<b>They're doing this on purpose,
it's part of their plan.</b>

1543
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:49,072
<b>You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna kill them in the game.</b>

1544
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:51,157
<b>Turn off respawn, kill them dead, now.</b>

1545
01:21:51,324 --> 01:21:53,660
<b>But that means any players
who die will be done for good.</b>

1546
01:21:53,827 --> 01:21:55,120
<b>They'll freak out.</b>

1547
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:59,708
<b>I don't care.</b>

1548
01:21:59,874 --> 01:22:04,254
<b>Sir? Sir, just to be clear,
are you telling me that it's go time?</b>

1549
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:05,463
<b>Are you looking
for some sort of banter thing</b>

1550
01:22:05,547 --> 01:22:06,548
<b>'cause you think we're friends now</b>

1551
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:08,049
<b>and we're in some sort of gang together?</b>

1552
01:22:08,216 --> 01:22:10,176
<b>Yes. Yes, that's exactly
what I'm looking for.</b>

1553
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:11,303
<b>Cool, we're a team.</b>

1554
01:22:11,386 --> 01:22:12,387
<b>We should come up</b>

1555
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:13,513
<b>- with a catchphrase, okay?
- All right.</b>

1556
01:22:13,638 --> 01:22:15,265
<b>- On 3. 1, 2, 3--
- 1, 2, 3--</b>

1557
01:22:15,432 --> 01:22:17,309
<b>Get back to work!</b>

1558
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,644
<b>Someone find me Keys!</b>

1559
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:26,693
<b>All right, people, you heard him.
It's go time!</b>

1560
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,617
<b>Okay, that's not good.</b>

1561
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,037
<b>He knows where we're going.</b>

1562
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,961
<b>All right, I got him. I got him.
Don't worry.</b>

1563
01:22:45,128 --> 01:22:46,796
<b>Want some four wheels to the face?</b>

1564
01:22:46,963 --> 01:22:48,131
<b>Take that. Boom!</b>

1565
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:54,471
<b>Rabbit's coming for you.
Apex predator.</b>

1566
01:22:56,097 --> 01:22:57,098
<b>Whoa!</b>

1567
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:06,733
<b>Here we go. Y'all watching this?</b>

1568
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,193
<b>I'm about to end this fool.</b>

1569
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:12,739
<b>Come on, come on, come on.</b>

1570
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:14,741
<b>Keys, if you're there,
a little help, please.</b>

1571
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:30,298
<b>God! Okay, who did that?
Who is doing that?</b>

1572
01:23:30,465 --> 01:23:34,135
<b>Don't play with me! Seriously!
I'm under way too much pressure!</b>

1573
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,641
<b>Come on!</b>

1574
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,896
<b>Go, go, go!</b>

1575
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:02,872
<b>I just checked with security.
Keys hasn't left the building.</b>

1576
01:24:02,997 --> 01:24:04,082
<b>Oh, sounds like
you've done everything possible.</b>

1577
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:05,166
<b>Time to give up? You wanna give up?</b>

1578
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:06,251
<b>No, I'm sensing you want me
to keep looking.</b>

1579
01:24:06,334 --> 01:24:07,335
<b>- Go.
- I'll be back.</b>

1580
01:24:07,502 --> 01:24:09,713
<b>I have no idea
where these fools are running to.</b>

1581
01:24:10,714 --> 01:24:14,300
<b>I do. Southern shore. Hitman's Beach.</b>

1582
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:16,553
<b>Well, that's stupid.
There's nothing out there but water.</b>

1583
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,305
<b>Game physics won't even let you
get past the shoreline.</b>

1584
01:24:21,057 --> 01:24:23,059
<b>Unless there is something out there.</b>

1585
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:26,062
<b>Antwan, is there something there?</b>

1586
01:24:27,564 --> 01:24:29,482
<b>Screw it. Art nerds.</b>

1587
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,025
<b>Time for Dude.</b>

1588
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:32,152
<b>We're still working on him.</b>

1589
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:34,446
<b>I worked on him myself. He's perfect.</b>

1590
01:24:34,612 --> 01:24:36,030
<b>Drop in Dude now.</b>

1591
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:38,575
<b>Just do it.
He's got, like, half a brain,</b>

1592
01:24:38,742 --> 01:24:41,953
<b>he's barely written,
but, sure, start the upload.</b>

1593
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:50,712
<b>What are we supposed to do now?</b>

1594
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:52,672
<b>Now Keys finds us a bridge.</b>

1595
01:24:54,174 --> 01:24:57,010
<b>Come to collect those knives
you stabbed in my back, bro?</b>

1596
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:00,597
<b>You've been helping Millie Rusk
this whole time.</b>

1597
01:25:00,764 --> 01:25:02,098
<b>She's looking for your build.</b>

1598
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:03,641
<b>What build, Antwan?</b>

1599
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,810
<b>It's not like you used
our code anyway, right?</b>

1600
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,187
<b>And if you didn't use our code</b>

1601
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:09,898
<b>then how can our original build
be in the game, right?</b>

1602
01:25:10,607 --> 01:25:12,484
<b>Or am I missing something?</b>

1603
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,361
<b>Leave us.</b>

1604
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:22,410
<b>Okay, Keys, let's have a real talk.</b>

1605
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:25,330
<b>If I'd put out your dumb game,
it would have bombed.</b>

1606
01:25:25,497 --> 01:25:26,748
<b>Antwan, you don't know
it would've failed.</b>

1607
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:27,832
<b>Yeah, I do know.</b>

1608
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,002
<b>I looked at the numbers,
the tracking, the focus groups.</b>

1609
01:25:31,169 --> 01:25:34,798
<b>Has it ever occurred to you that
some things matter more than numbers?</b>

1610
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:37,383
<b>What matters more than numbers?
Money?</b>

1611
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:40,220
<b>Yo, news flash, bro,
money is still numbers.</b>

1612
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:41,721
<b>Nothing matters more than numbers!</b>

1613
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:43,264
<b>You should be thanking me!</b>

1614
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:44,432
<b>I should be thanking you?</b>

1615
01:25:44,516 --> 01:25:46,851
<b>What about the profits
that you got from our work?</b>

1616
01:25:47,018 --> 01:25:49,062
<b>You chose your side, little Padawan.</b>

1617
01:25:49,229 --> 01:25:52,774
<b>And now, it's time for you to take
your place next to the Emperor.</b>

1618
01:25:52,857 --> 01:25:53,858
<b>You get me, bro?</b>

1619
01:25:54,943 --> 01:25:58,029
<b>Yeah, I get you. Bro.</b>

1620
01:25:58,154 --> 01:26:00,573
<b>Which leads me to this.</b>

1621
01:26:15,839 --> 01:26:17,090
<b>Thanks, Keys.</b>

1622
01:26:21,761 --> 01:26:23,388
<b>What the hell was that?</b>

1623
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:26,391
<b>Hey, Antwan, things are getting hectic.</b>

1624
01:26:29,686 --> 01:26:32,397
<b>Oh, I thought you were
smarter than this, Keys.</b>

1625
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:34,649
<b>You're obviously fired, you know that.</b>

1626
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:37,861
<b>And, you, what is she still doing
in the game, man?</b>

1627
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:38,945
<b>Boot everyone.</b>

1628
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:41,197
<b>Hold up.
You want me to boot all the players?</b>

1629
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:43,116
