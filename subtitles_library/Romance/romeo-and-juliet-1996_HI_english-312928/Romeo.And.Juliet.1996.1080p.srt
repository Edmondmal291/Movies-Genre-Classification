1
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:32,025
...in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

2
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:35,185
...from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

3
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:38,390
...where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

4
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,226
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

5
00:00:41,313 --> 00:00:44,305
...a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

6
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:46,953
...whose misadventured piteous overthrows...

7
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:50,230
...doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

8
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:53,066
The fearful passage
of their death-mark'd love...

9
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,826
...and the continuance
of their parents' rage...

10
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:59,667
...which, but their children's end,
nought could remove...

11
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:02,392
...is now the two hours' traffic of our stage.

12
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,872
Two households...

13
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:26,023
... both alike in dignity...

14
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:29,583
... in fair Verona, where we lay our scene...

15
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:34,667
... from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

16
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:39,065
... where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

17
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:46,352
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...

18
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:52,308
... a pair of star-cross'd lovers
take their life.

19
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:32,983
A dog of the house of Capulet
moves me!

20
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,264
Pedlar's excrement!

21
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:44,629
King Urinal! Go rot!

22
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,189
The boys! The boys!

23
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:04,507
- The quarrel is between our masters.
- And us their men!

24
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:06,268
Ahh!

25
00:03:27,393 --> 00:03:31,511
Hubble, bubble, toil and trouble!

26
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:35,552
And I am a pretty piece of flesh!

27
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,112
I am...

28
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,744
...a pretty piece of flesh!

29
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:49,862
- Here comes of the house of Capulet!
- Quarrel, I will back thee.

30
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:13,383
I will bite my thumb at them, which is
a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

31
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:31,751
Go forth! I will back thee!

32
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,671
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- I... I do bite my thumb, sir.

33
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:38,823
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

34
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,347
- Is the law of our side if I say ay?
- No!

35
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:44,505
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,
but I bite my thumb, sir!

36
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:47,505
- Do you quarrel, sir?
- Quarrel, sir? No, sir!

37
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:50,505
But if you do, sir, I am for you.
I serve as good a man as you.

38
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:52,504
- No better?
- Uh... uh...

39
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,629
Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

40
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:56,465
- Yes, sir, better!
- You lie!

41
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,625
Draw, if you be men!

42
00:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,910
Part, fools! You know not what you do.

43
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:12,586
Put up your Swords!

44
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:45,510
What, art thou drawn
among these... heartless hinds?

45
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,304
Turn thee, Benvolio...

46
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:53,152
...and look upon thy death.

47
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,144
I do but keep the peace.

48
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,189
Put up thy Sword...

49
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:00,787
...or manage it to part these men with me.

50
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,024
Peace?

51
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:05,304
Peace?

52
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:07,384
I hate the word...

53
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:10,345
...as I hate hell...

54
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,151
...all Montagues...

55
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:17,028
...and thee.

56
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,512
Bang bang!

57
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:20,944
Bang.

58
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:53,949
- Come forth! Come!
- Wait!

59
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:00,943
Come forth!

60
00:08:05,113 --> 00:08:07,502
From ancient grudge
break to new mutiny...

61
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,463
Do not proceed!

62
00:08:20,473 --> 00:08:22,464
Give me my Longsword, ho!

63
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:25,147
Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

64
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,830
Rebellious subjects...

65
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,631
...enemies to peace!

66
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:38,783
Throw your mistemper'd weapons
to the ground!

67
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:42,145
On pain of torture...

68
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:47,023
...from those bloody hands throw your
mistemper'd weapons to the ground!

69
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:50,941
Three civil brawls...

70
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,628
...bred of an airy word by thee,
old Capulet, and Montague...

71
00:08:54,713 --> 00:08:57,625
...have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.

72
00:08:58,793 --> 00:09:01,990
If ever you disturb our streets again...

73
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:06,063
...your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.

74
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,267
O where is Romeo? Saw you him today?

75
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,952
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

76
00:09:26,753 --> 00:09:29,472
Madam, underneath the Grove
of Sycamore...

77
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:32,272
...so early walking did I see your son.

78
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:34,548
Many a morning
hath he there been seen...

79
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,545
...with tears augmenting
the fresh morning's dew.

80
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:40,909
Away from light
steals home my heavy son...

81
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,303
...and private in his chamber
pens himself...

82
00:09:44,393 --> 00:09:46,384
...shuts up his windows...

83
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:51,263
...locks fair daylight out, and
makes himself an artificial night.

84
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,346
Why, then...

85
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:07,506
... O brawling love, O loving hate!

86
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:11,669
O anything of nothing first create!

87
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:13,584
Heavy lightness...

88
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,664
... serious vanity.

89
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,665
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms.

90
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:10,103
Black and portentous
must this humour prove...

91
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:15,025
...unless good counsel
may the cause remove.

92
00:11:16,873 --> 00:11:18,864
So please you, step aside.

93
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:24,425
I'll know his grievance
or be much denied.

94
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:27,104
Come, madam, let's away.

95
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,784
Good morrow, cousin.

96
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:45,664
Is the day so young?

97
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:47,823
But new struck, coz.

98
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:50,544
Ay me, sad hours seem long.

99
00:11:53,793 --> 00:11:56,227
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

100
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:58,349
It was.

101
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:00,105
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

102
00:12:00,193 --> 00:12:02,263
Not having that
which having makes them short.

103
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:03,581
- In love?
- Out.

104
00:12:03,673 --> 00:12:05,948
- Of love?
- Out of her favour where I am in love.

105
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,069
Alas that love,
so gentle in his view...

106
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:10,383
...should be so tyrannous
and rough in proof.

107
00:12:10,473 --> 00:12:12,941
Alas that love,
whose view is muffled still...

108
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,672
...should without eyes
see pathways to his will.

109
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:17,664
Where shall we dine?

110
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:18,663
... this costly blood.

111
00:12:18,753 --> 00:12:21,904
Never anger made good guard for itself.

112
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:23,108
The law hath not been dead...

113
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:25,104
O me! What fray was here?

114
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:27,502
- Coz, I...
- Yet tell me not, for I've heard it all.

115
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:30,153
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.

116
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:32,463
Why, then, O brawling love,
O loving hate!

117
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:34,464
O anything of nothing first create!

118
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,067
O heavy lightness, serious vanity!

119
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:39,747
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

120
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,869
Feather of lead, br...

121
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,104
Dost thou not laugh?

122
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,429
No, coz, I rather weep.

123
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,504
Good heart, at what?

124
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:53,024
- At thy good heart's oppression.
- Farewell, my coz.

125
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:56,901
Soft, I will go along. And if you
leave me so, you do me wrong.

126
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:07,663
But Montague is bound as well as I,
in penalty alike.

127
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,223
And 'tis not hard, I think, for men
as old as we to keep the peace.

128
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:14,669
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
and pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.

129
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,983
But now, my lord,
what say you to my suit?

130
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:22,022
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world.

131
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:26,106
Let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

132
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:27,990
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

133
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:31,304
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

134
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,748
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast.

135
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,267
At my poor house look to behold this night...

136
00:13:36,353 --> 00:13:39,823
...fresh female buds
that make dark heaven light.

137
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:42,384
Hear all, all see...

138
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:45,385
...and like her most
whose merit most shall be.

139
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:46,986
Come, go with me.

140
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:50,343
Tell me in sadness,
who is it that you love?

141
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,503
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

142
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:55,471
I aim'd so near when I supposed you loved.

143
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:58,547
A right good marksman!
And she's fair I love.

144
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:01,670
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

145
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,903
Well, in that hit you miss.
She'll not be hit with Cupid's arrow;

146
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:08,382
...nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes...

147
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,862
...nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.

148
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:13,626
Then she hath sworn
that she will still live chaste?

149
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:16,307
She hath, and in that sparing
makes huge waste.

150
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:19,988
- Be ruled by me. Forget to think of her.
- Teach me how I should forget to think.

151
00:14:20,073 --> 00:14:22,906
By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
Examine other beauties.

152
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:25,584
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

153
00:14:25,673 --> 00:14:28,267
Not mad,
but bound more than a madman is.

154
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:31,550
Shut up in prison, kept without
my food, whipp'd and tormented.

155
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:32,543
Good day, good fellow.

156
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:36,985
Now, I'll tell you without asking.

157
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:40,543
The great rich Capulet
holds an old accustom'd feast.

158
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,591
A fair assembly. Signor Placentio
and his wife and daughters...

159
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:48,189
... the lady widow of Utruvio, mmm,
and her lovely nieces Rosaline...

160
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:51,071
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
sups the fair Rosaline...

161
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:53,587
...whom thou so loves, with
all the admired beauties of Verona.

162
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:57,586
If you be not of the House of Montague,
come and crush a cup of wine!

163
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:59,948
Go thither, and with unattainted eye...

164
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,752
...compare her face with some
that I shall show...

165
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,552
...and I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

166
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:08,101
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown...

167
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:10,787
...but to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

168
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:19,582
Juliet!

169
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,307
Juliet!

170
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,430
Juliet!

171
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,182
Juliet!

172
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:28,502
Oh!

173
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:31,312
Ooh!

174
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:36,946
Nurse!

175
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,149
Nurse, where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

176
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,030
I bade her come. God forbid!

177
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:44,590
Julieta!

178
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:49,822
Juliet!

179
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,671
Juliet!

180
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,143
Juliet!

181
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:00,303
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

182
00:16:03,113 --> 00:16:05,946
O nurse, give us leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

183
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:10,989
Nurse, come back again!
I have remembered me.

184
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,984
Thou's hear our counsel.

185
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:16,224
Nurse, thou knowest
my daughter's of a pretty age.

186
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,508
Thou wast the prettiest babe
that e'er I nursed.

187
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:21,585
By my count, I was your mother
much upon these years.

188
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:25,664
You are now a maid.

189
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:27,744
Thus then in brief!

190
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:31,271
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

191
00:16:31,713 --> 00:16:33,704
A man, young lady!

192
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:37,263
Lady, such a man as all the world.
Why, he's a man of wax!

193
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:39,787
Verona's summer hath not such a flower...

194
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,989
Nay, he's a flower. In faith, a very flower...

195
00:16:42,073 --> 00:16:43,028
Nurse!

196
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:44,944
This night you shall behold him at our feast.

197
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:48,389
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face
and find delight writ there...

198
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:49,986
...with beauty's pen.

199
00:16:50,073 --> 00:16:53,907
This... precious book of love,
this unbound lover...

200
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,461
...to beautify him, only lacks a cover.

201
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:59,192
So shall you share all that he doth possess...

202
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:02,151
...by having him making yourself no less.

203
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:05,629
Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

204
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:08,269
Oh!

205
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:15,787
Speak briefly, could you like of Paris's love?

206
00:17:15,873 --> 00:17:18,785
I'll look to like, if looking liking move.

207
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,943
But no more deep will I endart mine eye...

208
00:17:21,033 --> 00:17:23,547
...than your consent gives strength
to make it fly.

209
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,186
Madam, the guests are come.

210
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:29,467
Go!

211
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,032
We follow thee.

212
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:34,267
Juliet! Ugh!

213
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,990
Go, girl. Seek happy nights to happy days.

214
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,503
You taffeta punk!

215
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,788
Die a beggar!

216
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:55,550
Sharing this one and only life

217
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:59,751
Ending up just another
lost and Ionely wife

218
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,107
You count up the years

219
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:04,981
And they will be filled with tears

220
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:09,184
Young hearts

221
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,423
Run free

222
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:12,389
Never be hung up

223
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,543
Like Rosaline and thee

224
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:21,381
Nay, gentle Romeo,
we must have you dance.

225
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:22,906
Not I. Not I, believe me.

226
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:26,349
You have dancing shoes with
nimble soles. I have a soul of lead.

227
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,707
You are a lover.

228
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:30,387
Borrow Cupid's wings and soar
with them above a common bound.

229
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,668
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

230
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:36,146
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

231
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:37,791
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough...

232
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:40,706
...too rude, too boisterous,
and it pricks like thorn.

233
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:42,909
If love be rough with you, be rough with love.

234
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:45,826
Prick love for pricking,
and you beat love down.

235
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:50,102
Every man, betake him to his legs!

236
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:52,946
Come, we burn daylight, ho! Ho-o!

237
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,261
Ho-o!

238
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:57,311
- But 'tis no wit to go!
- Why, may one ask?

239
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:59,384
- I dreamt a dream tonight.
- And so did I.

240
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,828
- And what was yours?
- That dreamers often lie.

241
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:04,381
In bed asleep,
while they do dream things true.

242
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:08,022
O! Then I see
Queen Mab hath been with you.

243
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,551
She is the fairies' midwife...

244
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:13,466
...and she comes in shape
no bigger than an agate-stone...

245
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:16,704
...on the forefinger of an alderman...

246
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:20,263
...drawn with a team of little atomies...

247
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:24,025
...over men's noses as they lie asleep.

248
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:27,910
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut...

249
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:32,508
...her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat.

250
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:37,906
And in this state she gallops
night by night through lovers' brains...

251
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:39,984
...and then they dream of...

252
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:41,942
...Iove;

253
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,184
...o'er lawyers' fingers,
who straight dream on fees.

254
00:20:45,273 --> 00:20:47,741
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck...

255
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,984
...and then dreams he
of cutting foreign throats;

256
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:54,861
...and, being thus frighted, swears
a prayer or two, and sleeps again.

257
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,832
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs...

258
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:02,872
...that presses them
and learns them first to bear...

259
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:06,309
...making them women of good carriage!

260
00:21:06,393 --> 00:21:07,872
This is she!

261
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:11,032
This is she!

262
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:24,390
Peace, good Mercutio, peace!

263
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:27,424
Thou talk'st of nothing.

264
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:31,784
True.

265
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,744
I talk of dreams...

266
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:38,950
...which are the children of an idle brain...

267
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:41,672
...begot of nothing but vain fantasy;

268
00:21:41,753 --> 00:21:46,588
...which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind...

269
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:49,471
...who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north...

270
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:52,226
...and, being angered,
puffs away from thence...

271
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:54,952
...turning aside to the dew-dropping south.

272
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:58,025
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves!

273
00:21:58,113 --> 00:22:01,105
Supper is done, and we shall come too late!

274
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,344
I fear, too early.

275
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:08,905
For my mind misgives some... consequence,
yet hanging in the stars...

276
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:14,226
...shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this night's revels...

277
00:22:14,313 --> 00:22:16,304
...and expire the term...

278
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:20,181
...of a despised life closed within my breast...

279
00:22:21,913 --> 00:22:24,905
...by some vile forfeit of untimely death.

280
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:29,307
But he that hath the steerage of my course...

281
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,305
...direct my sail!

282
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,030
On, lusty gentlemen!

283
00:22:46,353 --> 00:22:53,350
Young hearts

284
00:22:54,833 --> 00:23:01,181
Run free

285
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:23,142
Grr!

286
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:25,030
Thy drugs are quick.

287
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:30,224
Young hearts

288
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:32,144
Run free

289
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:33,905
Never be hung up

290
00:23:33,993 --> 00:23:36,188
Hung up like my man and me

291
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:39,668
Mm...

292
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,471
And me

293
00:23:42,873 --> 00:23:45,023
Young hearts

294
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,183
To yourself be true

295
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:48,911
Don't be no fool

296
00:23:48,993 --> 00:23:53,464
When love really don't love you

297
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:56,704
I said don't love you

298
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,983
I have seen the day that I could tell...

299
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,190
...a whispering tale in a fair lady's ear
such as would please.

300
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:06,070
Amore! Amore!

301
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,222
Amore...

302
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:10,822
Whoo!

303
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:55,669
Pride can stand a thousand trials

304
00:24:55,953 --> 00:25:01,425
The strong will never fall

305
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:08,104
But watching stars without you

306
00:25:08,193 --> 00:25:12,550
My soul cried

307
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:21,627
Heaving heart

308
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:29,028
Is full of pain

309
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:36,588
Oh, oh

310
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:43,749
The aching

311
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:55,384
Cos I'm kissing you

312
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:59,546
Oh

313
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:13,183
I'm kissing you

314
00:26:13,273 --> 00:26:15,264
Madam, your mother calls!

315
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:18,550
Touch me deep

316
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:26,505
Pure and true

317
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:30,948
Will you now deny to dance?

318
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:33,627
A man, young lady. Such a man!

319
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,627
What!

320
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:49,308
Dares that slave come hither
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

321
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:54,262
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
to strike him dead I hold it not a sin!

322
00:26:54,873 --> 00:26:57,592
Why, how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?

323
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,585
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
A Montague, our foe.

324
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,664
- Romeo is it?
- 'Tis he.

325
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:05,745
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.

326
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,188
I would not for the wealth of all this town...

327
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,582
...here in my house do him disparagement.

328
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:13,107
Therefore be patient, take no note of him.

329
00:27:13,193 --> 00:27:14,512
Uncle, I'll not endure him.

330
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:17,664
He shall be endured.

331
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:19,742
Go to!

332
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,063
What, goodman boy? I say he shall!

333
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:23,302
Go to!

334
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,985
Uncle, 'tis a shame.

335
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,904
Make a mutiny among my guests?

336
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:47,025
Did my heart love till now?

337
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,024
Forswear it, sight.

338
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:53,071
For I never saw true beauty till this night.

339
00:27:54,113 --> 00:28:04,102
Where are you now?

340
00:28:04,953 --> 00:28:15,784
Where are you now?

341
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:31,507
Cos I'm kissing you

342
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:48,590
I'm kissing you now

343
00:29:11,513 --> 00:29:14,664
If I profane with my unworthiest hand
this holy shrine...

344
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,744
...the gentle sin is this.

345
00:29:22,353 --> 00:29:25,902
My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand...

346
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:29,747
...to smooth that rough touch
with a tender kiss.

347
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:32,786
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much...

348
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:35,148
...which mannerly devotion shows in this.

349
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:39,272
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch...

350
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:42,629
...and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

351
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:46,549
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

352
00:29:47,073 --> 00:29:50,383
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

353
00:29:50,913 --> 00:29:53,586
Well, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

354
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:56,904
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair.

355
00:29:56,993 --> 00:30:00,872
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

356
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:04,386
Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

357
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:06,065
Yoo-hoo!

358
00:30:08,753 --> 00:30:09,390
Dave!

359
00:30:20,393 --> 00:30:23,465
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged.

360
00:30:23,553 --> 00:30:25,509
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took?

361
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:28,312
Sin from my lips?
O trespass sweetly urged!

362
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,951
Give me my sin again.

363
00:30:32,673 --> 00:30:34,664
You kiss by the book.

364
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,910
Juliet! Juliet! Oh!

365
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:45,785
Juliet?

366
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:47,582
Juliet!

367
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:59,186
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

368
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,585
Come, let's away!

369
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,748
Is she a Capulet?

370
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:35,470
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague...

371
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:38,021
...the only son of your great enemy.

372
00:31:57,113 --> 00:32:00,025
Away, be gone. The sport is at its best.

373
00:32:00,513 --> 00:32:03,027
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

374
00:32:34,113 --> 00:32:38,345
I am a pretty piece of flesh!

375
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:43,223
I am a pretty piece of flesh!

376
00:32:43,553 --> 00:32:48,343
I am a pretty piece of flesh! I am!

377
00:32:56,593 --> 00:32:59,232
My only love sprung from my only hate!

378
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:03,185
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

379
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:08,142
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
that I must love a loathed enemy.

380
00:33:20,553 --> 00:33:22,623
I will withdraw.

381
00:33:22,713 --> 00:33:26,149
But this intrusion shall,
now seeming sweet...

382
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,622
...convert to bitterest gall.

383
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:34,587
A pretty piece of flesh! I am!

384
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,947
A pretty piece of...

385
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,022
Romeo!

386
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:41,910
- Romeo!
- Romeo!

387
00:33:41,993 --> 00:33:42,948
Romeo!

388
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:45,462
Humours! Madman!

389
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:48,307
Passion! Lover!

390
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:51,631
I will conjure thee
by Rosaline's bright eyes...

391
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:54,671
...by her high forehead
and her scarlet lip...

392
00:33:54,753 --> 00:33:58,792
...by her fine foot, straight leg,
and quivering thigh!

393
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:06,711
O Romeo, that she were an open-ass
and thou a poperin pear!

394
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:09,227
He jests at scars that never felt the wound.

395
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:09,984
Romeo!

396
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:12,262
Good night!

397
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:16,824
I'll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.

398
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:39,312
Oh!

399
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:55,745
But soft!

400
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:58,063
What light through yonder window breaks?

401
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:05,864
It is the east...

402
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:08,706
...and Juliet is the sun!

403
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:16,142
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

404
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:18,827
...who is already sick and pale with grief...

405
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:22,701
...that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she.

406
00:35:22,793 --> 00:35:25,865
Be not her maid, since she is envious.

407
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:30,151
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
and none but fools do wear it.

408
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:35,271
O cast it off!

409
00:35:44,113 --> 00:35:46,502
It is my lady, it is my love.

410
00:35:46,993 --> 00:35:48,984
O that she knew she were.

411
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:57,587
Ay me!

412
00:36:00,673 --> 00:36:02,664
She speaks.

413
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:04,744
Speak again, bright angel.

414
00:36:06,553 --> 00:36:07,952
Romeo.

415
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,871
O Romeo!

416
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:12,944
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

417
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,628
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

418
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:24,423
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

419
00:36:25,993 --> 00:36:27,984
Shall I hear more...

420
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:29,984
...or shall I speak at this?

421
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:32,462
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

422
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:35,632
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

423
00:36:35,713 --> 00:36:37,669
What's Montague?

424
00:36:37,753 --> 00:36:39,550
It is not hand...

425
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:42,022
...nor foot, nor arm, nor face...

426
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:47,145
...nor any other part belonging to a man.

427
00:36:47,713 --> 00:36:49,704
O be some other name!

428
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,984
What's in a name?

429
00:36:54,553 --> 00:36:58,592
That which we call a rose by
any other word would smell as sweet.

430
00:36:58,673 --> 00:37:01,790
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called...

431
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:06,469
...retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

432
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:09,430
Romeo, doff thy name;

433
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:12,903
...and for thy name, which is
no part of thee, take all myself.

434
00:37:12,993 --> 00:37:14,984
- I take thee at thy word.
- Agh!

435
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:27,224
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

436
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:29,588
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

437
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:32,028
How camest thou hither, tell me,
and wherefore?

438
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:34,069
The garden walls are high
and hard to climb...

439
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:36,508
...and the place death,
considering who thou art.

440
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:39,187
With love's light wings
did I o'erperch these walls...

441
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:41,264
...for stony limits cannot hold love out...

442
00:37:41,353 --> 00:37:43,708
...and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

443
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:46,432
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me!

444
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:10,911
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

445
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:18,183
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

446
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:20,424
But thou love me...

447
00:38:20,513 --> 00:38:22,504
...let them find me here.

448
00:38:22,993 --> 00:38:27,589
My life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued...

449
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:32,584
...wanting of thy love.

450
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:12,821
Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face;

451
00:39:12,913 --> 00:39:15,222
...else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek...

452
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:17,873
...for that which thou hast
heard me speak tonight.

453
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:19,944
Fain would I dwell on form...

454
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:22,069
...fain, fain deny what I have spoke.

455
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:24,542
But... farewell compliment.

456
00:39:26,193 --> 00:39:28,184
Dost thou love me?

457
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:32,261
I know thou wilt say "Ay",
and I will take thy word.

458
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:34,787
Yet, if thou swear'st,
thou may'st prove false.

459
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:38,229
O gentle Romeo, if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

460
00:39:38,313 --> 00:39:40,702
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow...

461
00:39:40,793 --> 00:39:43,990
...that tips with silver all these fruit tree tops...

462
00:39:44,073 --> 00:39:46,064
O swear not by the moon...

463
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:49,862
...the inconstant moon that monthly
changes in her circled orb...

464
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:52,672
...lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

465
00:39:52,753 --> 00:39:55,392
What shall I swear by?

466
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,464
Do not swear at all.

467
00:39:57,553 --> 00:39:59,544
Or, if thou wilt...

468
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:03,421
...swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry...

469
00:40:03,513 --> 00:40:05,504
...and I'll believe thee.

470
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:07,944
If my heart's...

471
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:10,464
...dear love...

472
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:25,111
Do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy in this contract tonight.

473
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:28,503
It is too rash, too unadvised,
too sudden, too like the lightning...

474
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:31,153
...which doth cease to be
ere one can say "It lightens".

475
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:32,632
Sweet, good night!

476
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:35,307
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath...

477
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:38,032
...may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

478
00:40:38,113 --> 00:40:39,148
Good night.

479
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:42,072
Good night!

480
00:40:44,393 --> 00:40:46,349
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

481
00:40:48,393 --> 00:40:50,782
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

482
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:56,263
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

483
00:40:59,713 --> 00:41:02,591
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!

484
00:41:12,393 --> 00:41:13,872
Juliet!

485
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,822
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.

486
00:41:23,913 --> 00:41:26,871
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
thy purpose marriage...

487
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:29,751
...send me word tomorrow, by one
that I'll procure to come to thee...

488
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:32,028
...where and what time thou wilt
perform the rite...

489
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:33,990
...and all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay...

490
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:36,223
...and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.

491
00:41:36,313 --> 00:41:37,428
Julieta!

492
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:40,069
Ay! By and by, I come!

493
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:43,031
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee...

494
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:45,104
- Juliet!
- By and by, I come!

495
00:41:45,193 --> 00:41:47,866
...to cease thy strife,
and leave me to my grief.

496
00:41:49,313 --> 00:41:51,031
Tomorrow will I send.

497
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:52,944
So thrive my soul.

498
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,230
A thousand times good night.

499
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:05,350
A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light!

500
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:07,702
Juliet!

501
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,185
Julieta!

502
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:17,031
Good night.

503
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:23,187
Love goes toward love
as schoolboys from their books;

504
00:42:24,513 --> 00:42:26,504
...but love from love...

505
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:30,023
...toward school with heavy looks.

506
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:32,390
Romeo!

507
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:35,070
What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

508
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:38,104
By the hour of nine.

509
00:42:38,193 --> 00:42:41,265
I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year till then.

510
00:42:41,713 --> 00:42:43,431
Good night.

511
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:52,591
Good night. Good night.

512
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,704
Parting is such sweet sorrow...

513
00:43:03,793 --> 00:43:06,910
...that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

514
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:12,182
Juliet!

515
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:16,108
You and me always

516
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:18,582
And for ever

517
00:43:18,673 --> 00:43:22,109
You and me always

518
00:43:22,193 --> 00:43:24,991
And for ever

519
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:29,908
Ba ba-ba ba-ba

520
00:43:29,993 --> 00:43:33,349
It was always you and me...

521
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:38,943
Almighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants, herbs, stones...
