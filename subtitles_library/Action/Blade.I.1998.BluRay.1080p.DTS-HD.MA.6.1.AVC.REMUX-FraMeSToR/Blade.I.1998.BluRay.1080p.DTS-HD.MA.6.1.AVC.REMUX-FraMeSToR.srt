1
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,399
Police found her in the street.

2
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,151
Looks like she was bitten
by some kind of an animal.

3
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:12,489
Jesus. Her water's broken.
She's going into uterine contractions.

4
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,199
We have to do a C-section.

5
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,719
- What you got down there, little man?
- That's my heat-seeker.

6
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,095
I'll bet it is.

7
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,727
- So where we going?
- It's a surprise, baby.

8
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:28,065
Yeah, I like surprises. Yeah.

9
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,612
Oh, my God.

10
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,323
What the fuck are we doing here?

11
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,702
Whoo. Look at all that.

12
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,332
What the fuck is that?

13
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,923
Hey.

14
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,969
What did you just say?

15
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,259
Wow.

16
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,737
Hey, what's up? Oh, man.

17
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,457
Whoo! All right.

18
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah. Whoo!

19
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
What's happening?

20
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,618
Hey, man.

21
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,000
Fuck.

22
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,429
Fuck, I need a drink.

23
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,228
No. No.

24
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,402
What's wrong, baby?

25
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,408
No!

26
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,414
Oh, no.

27
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,690
Shut up, man.

28
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,420
- Is that him?
- Jesus, it's him.

29
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,214
It's the Day Walker.

30
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,988
Come on, Day Walker!

31
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,470
Hey! I'm gonna rip your fucking head off.

32
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,490
- Look out! Hey, out of the way!
- Get out of there!

33
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,819
That's him. That's him.
Get him. Fuck him up.

34
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:53,158
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad. Whoo!

35
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,348
Quinn...

36
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,436
...I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

37
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:11,027
Thought I might try fire, for a change.

38
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,990
Give my regards to Frost.

39
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,871
No, please. Please don't.

40
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,957
Over here, sergeant.

41
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,262
- Put him out.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,514
Paramedics, coming through.

43
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,582
Got a charred cadaver here for you.
It's still warm too.

44
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,250
One, two, three.

45
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,175
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

46
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,469
Paramedics said he was still
screaming when they found him...

47
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,097
...stapled to a wall.

48
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,516
That's very pretty.

49
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,866
Did you check the chem panel?
Blood sugar's three times the norm.

50
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,118
Phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

51
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,495
You took this off a DOA?

52
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,123
Yeah.

53
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,500
But this doesn't make any sense.

54
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,965
The red blood cells are biconvex,
which is impossible.

55
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,344
Look at the polys, they're binucleated.

56
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,684
- Okay, Curtis, it's 3:00 in the morning...
- This is not a joke.

57
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,063
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

58
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,733
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

59
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,486
I just want you to come
down and take a look.

60
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:26,663
Okay. Show me the body.

61
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,998
And I don't wanna hear a word about us.

62
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,543
Done. We've had that conversation.

63
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,091
You haven't started
on the internal organs yet?

64
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,386
No, just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

65
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,015
The maxilla looks a little deformed.

66
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,685
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

67
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,854
I'm gonna go ahead start the Y
and check the tracheal mucosa.

68
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,279
Let me ask you something.

69
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,073
Honestly.

70
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,368
You ever have second thoughts about us?

71
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:08,788
Sometimes.

72
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,543
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

73
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,336
You wanna cut me some slack here?

74
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,089
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

75
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,550
- Look, Curtis, it's over.
- I'm trying. Really, I am.

76
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,698
- Call security!
- Get back!

77
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,298
Came back to finish you off.

78
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,342
Get out of my way, you freak.

79
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,892
Freeze!

80
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,480
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?

81
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,782
- He's there, right there.
- Go ahead.

82
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,450
- Go.
- Hey, you, freeze.

83
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,035
- Come on. Come on.
- Fire.

84
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,704
Keep going. Keep going.

85
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,376
Come back out.

86
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,254
- Go.
- He can't get out.

87
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,430
- Freeze!
- Hold it right there.

88
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,640
- Don't do it.
- Hey, hey...

89
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,030
My shoulder...

90
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,700
...is dislocated.

91
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,433
<i>I feel rivers overflowing</i>

92
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,435
Whistler.

93
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,982
Whistler.

94
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,489
Bringing home strays now?

95
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,201
She's been bitten.

96
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,291
Should've killed her, then.

97
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,418
Yeah, I know...

98
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,838
...but I didn't.

99
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:20,850
You watch her close.
She starts to turn, you finish her off.

100
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,772
Or I will.

101
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,489
She's borderline.

102
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,953
Another hour,
she'd be well into the change.

103
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,125
Dr. Karen Jenson, listen close.

104
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,838
I'm gonna inject you
with allium sativum. Garlic.

105
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,007
This is gonna hurt a lot.

106
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,051
It was Quinn.

107
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,762
Frost's little errand boy?

108
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,890
- You get a lead on him?
- No.

109
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,559
Too bad.

110
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,272
Hold her.

111
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:23,162
I give her fifty-fifty, if she
makes it through the night.

112
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,900
Blade, the Day Walker.

113
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,611
Still pursuing his ridiculous crusade.

114
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,450
How many died?

115
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,580
We don't have an exact count.
Apparently, he used a lot of silver.

116
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,167
- We're having difficulty...
- Send in Frost.

117
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,635
Deacon Frost.

118
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,891
You can come in now.

119
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,927
These nightclubs of yours are dangerous.

120
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,763
Are they?

121
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,558
They draw needless attention to our kind.
You know our policy.

122
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,727
Your policy, not mine.

123
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,896
Our livelihood...

124
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,901
...depends on our ability to blend in...

125
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,527
...on our discretion.

126
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,782
Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

127
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,201
We should be ruling the humans...

128
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,329
...not running around making
back-alley treaties with them.

129
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,957
For fuck's sake, these people
are our food not our allies.

130
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,877
- You're out of line, Frost.
- Am I?

131
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,756
Maybe I'm just the first to say out
loud what we've all been thinking.

132
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:43,469
We have existed this way
for thousands of years.

133
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:48,224
Who are you to challenge our ways?

134
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,559
You're not even a pureblood.

135
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,189
Like it matters.

136
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,152
I was born a vampire...

137
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,031
...as was every other
member of this house.

138
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,366
But, you, Frost...

139
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,413
...you were merely turned.

140
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,503
The world belongs to us,
not the humans.

141
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,005
You know that.

142
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,804
Do we have any other business to discuss?

143
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,976
Well, there's the matter of our offshore
accounts. We're having difficulty...

144
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,769
And have you made the transfer...?

145
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:39,233
Gaetano, you may wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.

146
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,978
- You're a week early.
- Yeah.

147
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:26,780
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

148
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,076
Yeah, I figured that might happen.

149
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,546
You take care, all right?

150
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,319
I must be getting soft in my old age...

151
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,322
...letting you bring home a stray like that.

152
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,911
It was damn stupid of you.
You might have lucked out though.

153
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,165
I checked her background.

154
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:47,087
Turns out she's a hematologist.

155
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,549
She might be useful to us.

156
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,343
I doubt it.

157
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,971
I'm serious.

158
00:25:56,138 --> 00:26:01,143
I took a look at that notebook of hers.
She's on to something.

159
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,563
I had to increase the dose.

160
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,401
It's over 50 milligrams now.
That's getting dangerous.

161
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:14,031
Just do it, old man.

162
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,551
Wander off the beaten path, doctor?

163
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,263
Who are you people?

164
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,848
My name's Abraham Whistler.

165
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,600
You've met Blade.

166
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,660
So am I a prisoner here?

167
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,080
Not at all.

168
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:49,418
We just had to take certain
precautions before we let you go.

169
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,838
You gotta understand, they're everywhere.

170
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,840
Vampires.

171
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,633
The <i>Hominis nocturna.</i>

172
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,469
We hunt them, you see.

173
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,223
Moving from one city to the next
tracking their migrations.

174
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,641
They're hard to kill.

175
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:08,395
- They tend to regenerate.
- And I'm supposed to believe all this?

176
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:11,565
Well, you already met
Mr. Crispy at the hospital.

177
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,317
What do you think?

178
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:19,239
So, what do you use, then?
Stakes? Crosses?

179
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:24,119
Crosses don't do squat.
Some of the legends are true, though.

180
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,998
Vampires are severely allergic to silver.

181
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,959
Feed them garlic and they go
into anaphylactic shock.

182
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,463
Then, of course, there's always
sunlight, ultraviolet rays.

183
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:40,135
I got this sucker running.
You wanna give it a try tonight?

184
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,559
Still heavy.

185
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,395
But you're so big.

186
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,401
If you wanna live to see another day,
you'll be out of town by nightfall.

187
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,320
So where am I supposed to go?

188
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,618
You've been exposed to them.

189
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,538
One way or another,
somebody's gonna take you out.

190
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,462
There's a war going on out there.

191
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,757
Blade, myself, a few others...

192
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:22,010
...we've tried to keep it from spilling
over onto the streets...

193
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,515
...but sometimes, people like yourself
get caught in the crossfire.

194
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,309
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

195
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,937
They own the police.

196
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,606
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

197
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,484
Chances are you've seen them
yourself and didn't know it.

198
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,361
On the subway or in a bar.

199
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,573
So that's it?

200
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,411
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way.

201
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,377
Here. Vampire Mace.

202
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,255
Silver nitrate, essence of garlic.

203
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,966
You keep your eyes open.

204
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,468
Be careful.

205
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,224
One other thing...

206
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,185
...buy yourself a gun.

207
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,147
If you start getting
sensitive to daylight...

208
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,486
...if you find you're thirsty, regardless
of how much you've had to drink...

209
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,866
...then I suggest you take
that gun and use it on yourself.

210
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,955
Better that than the alternative.

211
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,306
You have been warned before.

212
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:35,936
These archives are restricted
to the members of the House of Erebus.

213
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:41,900
You are wasting your time.
It's a dead language.

214
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,654
The ancient texts can
never be translated.

215
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:49,282
You wouldn't even understand them.

216
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,954
Damn it, Frost, I'm talking to you!

217
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,833
Shh.

218
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,877
Keep your voice down, Gaetano.

219
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,090
We're in a library.
You don't need to shout.

220
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,885
What are you up to, Frost?

221
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,108
What are you gonna do? Hm?

222
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,656
What?

223
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,496
You bore me.

224
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,783
Remember what we told you.

225
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,162
You keep your eyes open.
They're everywhere.

226
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,665
But it's daytime.

227
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,591
- Hey, hey, hey, that's mine.
- Spare some change?

228
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,202
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

229
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,685
How you doing?

230
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:46,186
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa! Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on. I'm a police officer.

231
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:49,272
I'm sorry, okay? Police officer.
I didn't mean to scare you.

232
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,025
- The front door was open.
- What are you doing in here?

233
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,486
I'm just here on a routine check.

234
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,822
Look, I'm Officer Krieger, 42nd Precinct.

235
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,742
You're Karen Jenson, right?

236
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,494
Yeah.

237
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,915
Your co-workers at the hospital said
that you were kidnapped last night.

238
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,334
Are you okay?

239
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,587
What happened to the other
doctor I was with?

240
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,008
Curtis Webb, he died.

241
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,012
No, look, don't worry
about that right now, okay?

242
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:26,267
- Why?
- Because you're dead too, bitch.

243
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,482
Son of a bitch, what is this?

244
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,568
What is this, garlic?

245
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,738
Yeah, well, he said it would
work against vampires.

246
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,824
Vampires?

247
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,034
Who said I was a vampire, huh?

248
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,496
Nobody.

249
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,086
He's a familiar.

250
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,506
A vampire wannabe.

251
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,175
If he's loyal enough...

252
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,804
...and he proves himself,
maybe his master will turn him.

253
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,850
Wait a minute. You used me as bait?

254
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,518
Get over it.

255
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,650
Is all that necessary?

256
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,241
That's a glyph, a vampire cattle brand.

257
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,119
It means Officer Krieger here
is somebody's property.

258
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,788
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker...

259
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,915
...then they have to answer to his owner.

260
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:37,422
Deacon Frost. We've been
tracking him for a long time.

261
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:43,470
All right, Officer Krieger, you gonna be
a good little bloodhound, huh?

262
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,555
Tell us what your master's been up to?

263
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,391
Great, now you're robbing him.
You gonna rob me too?

264
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,519
How do you think that we fund
this organization, huh?

265
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,731
We're not exactly the March of Dimes.

266
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,444
It's fake.

267
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,033
Well, looks like our friend
here's been blood running.

268
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,995
Hillburn Clinic. I know this place,
it's a blood bank.

269
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,040
Owned by vampires,
and there's one in every city.

270
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:15,001
And they always deliver.
So where were you taking it?

271
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,128
I don't know what you're talking...

272
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:20,465
Look, take it easy.

273
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:25,220
I'm only gonna ask you one more time.
Where were you taking it?

274
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,471
Go fuck yourself.

275
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,224
- Fuck me? No, you suck this.
- No, look.

276
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,892
Get out of the way.

277
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,189
Oh, my God.

278
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,361
Look, right over there.

279
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,368
You better wake up.

280
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,496
The world you live in is just
a sugarcoated topping.

281
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:55,208
There is another world
beneath it, the real world.

282
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,879
And if you wanna survive it,
you'd better learn to pull the trigger.

283
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,260
Wait a minute. I'm coming with you.

284
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,553
You're useless.

285
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,559
I have to stick with you.

286
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,813
It's the only way that I'll stay alive
long enough to find a cure for myself.

287
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,440
There is no cure.

288
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,911
He's not gonna come back.

289
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,830
Nobody's that stupid.

290
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,916
When you understand
the nature of a thing...

291
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,960
...you know what it's capable of.

292
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,356
- It's Krieger. I'm at 16009.
- <i>Yes?</i>

293
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,443
- Get me Pearl.
- <i>Pearl is feeding.</i>

294
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:10,617
<i>I got a delivery from Frost here
and I just had a run-in with Blade.</i>

295
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,374
We've gotta clear out
that clinic on Hillburn now.

296
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,524
Looks like we hit pay dirt.
That's a vampire mark.

297
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,361
It means there's a safe house
around here somewhere.

298
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:49,656
A place they can go if dawn is coming.

299
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,326
See the valets over there?
They're vampires.

300
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,079
So is the doorman.

301
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,414
And the whore on the corner.

302
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:03,211
- How can you tell?
- By the way they move.

303
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:05,546
The way they smell.

304
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,301
It's like a bad dream.

305
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,971
There's worse things out
tonight than vampires.

306
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,474
- Like what?
- Like me.

307
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,602
Okay, Vampire Anatomy 101.

308
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:23,398
Crosses and running water don't do dick,
forget what you've seen in movies.

309
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:27,777
You use a stake, silver, or sunlight.
You know how to use one of these?

310
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:31,781
- No, but I damn sure learn quick.
- Safety's off, round's chambered.

311
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:35,284
Silver hollow-point filled with garlic.
Aim for the head or the heart.

312
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,412
Anything else is your ass.

313
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,751
Do you have an invitation?

314
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,591
Kenji.

315
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:48,149
Where's the entrance?

316
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:51,110
I can't tell you that, man, if...

317
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,116
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where's the entrance?

318
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:02,371
Okay. Look, it's in the freezer.

319
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:15,176
Come on, man, I told you!
It's in the fridge!

320
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,813
- Okay.
- You give Frost a message from me.

321
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,650
You tell him it's open season
on all suck-heads.

322
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,194
Some kind of archive.

323
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,450
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

324
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,369
Isn't this just a little high-tech?

325
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:27,748
They've got their claws into everything.
Politics, finance, real estate.

326
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,002
They already own half of downtown.

327
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,442
- Hey, how's it going?
- I'm surprised they were there.

328
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:56,485
Frost throws a good party.

329
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,697
Yeah, but where is he?

330
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,879
Come on, baby.

331
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,600
Don't keep everyone waiting.

332
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,164
<i>Deacon, there's someone
here to see you.</i>

333
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,711
I gotta talk to you, Frost.

334
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,464
I'm sorry. I had to come here.

335
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:02,677
It's a mistake going to Pearl's.
I know that. Dumb fucking me.

336
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,471
- I know you're disappointed.
- Am I that transparent?

337
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,056
- You wanna meet him?
- Yeah.

338
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,434
I can get you guys in with him, we're tight.
We're like brothers.

339
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,979
Fuck. Frost...

340
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,397
- Hey.
- Yeah.

341
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,985
Deac, Deac, I've been telling
these bitches all about you, man.

342
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,653
They've been dying to meet you.

343
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,614
They are so psyched, these
badass bitches. I meet them...

344
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,741
- Nice.
- Deac?

345
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:28,411
Frost, it's about Blade.

346
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,830
He's busy. When he's
focused on something...

347
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,583
- ...he doesn't have time to fuck around.
- Frost, this is important.

348
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,796
Blade was waiting for me.
Look, they're using the girl as bait.

349
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,716
- And you were stupid enough to take it.
- Shut up, bitch.

350
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,219
I didn't know he was gonna be there.
It was a trap, see?

351
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:48,556
But don't worry, it's no problem.
We can still get the girl.

352
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,392
Yeah.

353
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,400
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

354
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,572
Oh, come on.

355
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,867
- Oh, yes.
- All right.

356
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,757
Forget the girl. I want Blade.

357
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,467
I know you do.

358
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,845
You hear me, Quinn? I want him alive.

359
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:29,055
What?

360
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,977
Wait a minute, man.
You want him alive?

361
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,441
What's that smell?

362
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,696
Study the image carefully, Frost.

363
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:50,743
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

364
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,286
Krieger, is that you?

365
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,747
He's here. He's here.

366
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,583
This must be Pearl, the record keeper.

367
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,086
He's here.

368
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,714
He's going to kill me.
You need me, Frost. You need me.

369
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,674
Pearl, you're history.

370
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,344
Have the good grace to die
with some fucking dignity.

371
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,555
Frost, you useless bloodsucker.

372
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,809
- <i>Congratulations, Blade.</i>
- Frost.

373
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,520
<i>I hear you've been looking for me.
I'm flattered.</i>

374
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,979
It'll pass.

375
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,525
Fuck.

376
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:28,697
- What is that?
- That, biscuit boy, is a UV lamp.

377
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,492
We're gonna play a little game
of 20 questions.

378
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:35,329
Depending on how you answer,
you may walk out of here with a tan.

379
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,540
What's that?

380
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,127
Oh, that? Oh, it's nothing.
It's routine research.

381
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,671
Actually, it's a video game.

382
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,058
That must have hurt.

383
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,520
- It's a fragment, a piece of the prophecy.
- What prophecy?

384
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:03,441
Oh, I'm not really sure.
There's so many. How could I...?

385
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,292
And there is nothing you can
do about it, Day Walker!

386
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,043
Is that so?

387
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,297
Well, that's what Frost says.

388
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,467
Then you won't mind me borrowing
this for a while, will you?

389
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,428
If he moves, fry him.

390
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,724
What's in here?

391
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,560
Nothing. It's a storeroom.
You're wasting your time.

392
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,645
There's nothing of importance to anyone.

393
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,065
- Then you won't mind if I take a peek.
- No!

394
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,797
He moved.

395
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,414
What is this?

396
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:46,669
These are the pages
from the Book of Erebus.

397
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,421
The vampire Bible.

398
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,342
It contains everything...

399
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,553
...their entire history.

400
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,182
La Magra must be one of their legends.

401
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,729
Why is Frost so interested in La Magra?

402
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,898
Shh!

403
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,520
Give me your hand.

404
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,150
Do you remember me?

405
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:10,878
Give it to him!

406
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,648
Hey. Hey! Nice one.

407
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:34,693
Well, well, well. You took my arm, man.

408
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,530
Remember? But it's cool.

409
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:40,949
I got a new one.

410
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,244
Think I'll ever play piano again?

411
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:50,167
You can slice him, you can dice him,
but the Quinn man just keeps on coming.

412
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,712
Check it out. I've got his pig-sticker.

413
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,551
You're a fuckup, Crease.

414
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:04,682
You're a fuckup. "I got his pig-sticker."

415
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:08,227
You're just full of surprises,
ain't you, chief?

416
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,321
Stay away from me, sweetness...

417
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,574
...because I'm not finished with you yet.

418
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,161
Lookie here.

419
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,834
Silver. Nice craftsmanship, huh?

420
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,877
Probably cost you a pretty penny.

421
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:38,298
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

422
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,553
...just a little too seriously, don't you think?

423
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:51,145
Come to think of it,
Blade, I owe you one.

424
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,902
Actually, if you wanna
get technical, Blade...

425
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,196
...I owe you two.

426
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,535
What's so funny, bright eyes?

427
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,582
I'm expecting company.

428
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:29,308
Catch you fuckers at a bad time?

429
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:30,684
No, no guns!

430
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:35,606
No, no, no! You idiots!

431
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,447
No, fuck him. Get Blade!

432
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,115
You asshole!

433
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,868
- Move it!
- Hurry up.

434
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:56,794
Idiots, stop it, now! I need him!
Deac wants Blade alive! Go!

435
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,091
You've been listening the whole time?

436
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,426
Radio contact.

437
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:07,221
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperone?

438
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,357
Christ, I'm too old for this.

439
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,609
Somebody get me a goddamn wheelchair.

440
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,286
Whistler.

441
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,289
He can take care of himself. Jump.

442
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,496
What are you gonna do?

443
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,000
Oh, my God.

444
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,515
What's wrong?

445
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:20,020
It's dislocated.

446
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,772
Let me help you.

447
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,315
Let me help you.

448
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:38,121
- Here, let me give you a hand...
- No. Get away.

449
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,722
You're one of them, aren't you?

450
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:02,604
No. I'm something else.

451
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:11,029
<i>I found him when he was 13.</i>

452
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:15,534
<i>He'd been living on the streets,
feeding off the homeless.</i>

453
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,204
<i>His need for blood had
taken hold at puberty.</i>

454
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,916
I took him for a vampire at first.

455
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,544
Almost killed him too.

456
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:28,422
Then I realized what he was.

457
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:32,884
Blade's mother was attacked
by a vampire while she was pregnant.

458
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,054
She died, but he lived.

459
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:39,975
Unfortunately, he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

460
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:45,564
He can withstand garlic,
silver, even sunlight.

461
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,274
And he's got their strength.

462
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,237
This time tomorrow,
all those wounds of his will be healed.

463
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,700
He still ages like a human, though.

464
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,411
See, vampires age slower than us.

465
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:05,834
Unfortunately, he also
inherited their thirst.

466
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,463
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

467
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,882
Time's running out.

468
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,136
His body's starting to reject it.

469
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:21,516
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

470
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,105
Why do you hunt them?

471
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,610
I had a family once.

472
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,946
A wife, two daughters.

473
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:40,494
Then a drifter came calling one evening.
A vampire.

474
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,289
He toyed with them first.

475
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:49,086
Tried to make me decide
which order they'd die in.

476
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,677
We kill as many of them as we
can find, but it's getting worse.

477
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,096
Because of Frost.

478
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,682
There's something happening
in the vampire ranks.

479
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,018
It's something big.

480
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:09,731
And I'd stake my life that son
of a bitch is at the center of it.

481
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,362
Blade?

482
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,215
Whistler told me what happened.

483
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,762
He told me what you are.

484
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,725
You don't know me.

485
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,687
You don't know anything about me.

486
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,066
I'm not human.

487
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,404
You look human to me...

488
01:00:57,571 --> 01:01:00,365
Humans don't drink blood.

489
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,951
That was a long time ago.

490
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,912
Maybe you should let that go.

491
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:13,670
I have spent my whole life looking
for that thing that killed my mother...

492
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,424
...and made me what I am.

493
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,804
And every time I take one
of those monsters out...

494
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:26,183
...I get a little piece of that life back.

495
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,853
So don't you tell me about forgetting.

496
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,733
My fault? He took us by surprise!

497
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,652
Two of them against your
entire security force?

498
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,030
Don't put that shit on me,
you were there too.

499
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:43,325
I'm sure Deacon will appreciate
our cutback in payroll.

500
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,703
- Ow! You little skeez.
- The amputee lifestyle really suits you.

501
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,914
I should put this stump
through that grin.

502
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,542
Face it, angel. You were sloppy.
You got what you deserved.

503
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,882
Deac, let me take this guy out, man.

504
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,468
Look what he fucking did!
He took my hand again!

505
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,304
Listen to me. I want him alive.

506
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,223
What the fuck are you talk...?

507
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,559
You want him alive? We've been trying
to kill this motherfucker for years.

508
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,478
Are you out of your fucking mind?
You want...?

509
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:16,358
Shh. Big guy, relax.

510
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,817
Be patient.

511
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:20,946
We got a lot to do here.

512
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,490
I need you, man.

513
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:30,205
- I need you.
- Yeah.

514
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,749
Good morning.

515
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:17,544
How you feeling?

516
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,221
Look at that.

517
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:34,769
Ooh! Getting a little toasty out here, huh?

518
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:40,108
When was the last time you stopped
to appreciate a good sunrise?

519
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:44,362
That's right, you were born a vampire,
so you never had the pleasure, have you?

520
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,407
That's okay. It's all right.

521
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:50,785
At least we're here together.
Share the moment.

522
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,538
Which means a lot to me
by the way, really.

523
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,582
I mean that.

524
01:03:57,167 --> 01:03:59,461
Because actually,
when you get to know me...

525
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,422
...I'm a fairly sentimental type of guy.

526
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:05,383
Bit of an innocent, you might say.

527
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,888
Do what you want, Frost.

528
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,182
Doesn't make any difference.

529
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,561
You just don't fucking get it.

530
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,899
- You're never gonna be a pureblood.
- Hold him.

531
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,945
You will never rule us.

532
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:41,628
Jesus Christ. Have a nice day.

533
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:45,382
Sorry, you old dog. You just got
a little too long in the teeth.

534
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:51,763
What, man? That was funny.
"Long, tooth." It's funny, man.

535
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,432
Did I tell you the one
about the leprechaun...?

536
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,839
What have you done with Dragonetti?

537
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,889
Let's get down to business, shall we?

538
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:37,934
I need 12 volunteers.

539
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,401
Whistler.

540
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,155
What is this?

541
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,367
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

542
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:55,952
I took it from the archives.

543
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,955
- It's written in blood.
- It's from the Book of Erebus.

544
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,672
I think it's what Frost
has been working on.

545
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,217
It's something about the blood god,
the Spirits of the 12.

546
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,761
I don't know.
I can't make out the rest of it.

547
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,472
Well, maybe this'll help.

548
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:18,683
We'll figure out something.

549
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:20,935
So, what's all of this?

550
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:25,565
Took a trip to the hospital last night,
borrowed some equipment.

551
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,526
For your miracle cure?

552
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:32,947
This is EDTA. It's an anticoagulant.

553
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,200
We use it to treat blood clots.

554
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:40,538
Look what happens when I introduce it
onto a sample of vampire blood.

555
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,209
Take a step back.

556
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,086
The reaction's energetic.

557
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:59,516
- Some cure.
- I didn't say EDTA was a cure.

558
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:04,187
But maybe you could use it
to explode some vampire heads.

559
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:08,900
Wait a minute.
I need a sample of your blood.

560
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:12,612
Later. I gotta go downtown.

561
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:15,490
- I need some serum.
- Serum can wait.

562
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:18,034
This is important.

563
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:42,016
- Is he sick?
- Cancer.

564
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,438
You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?

565
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:52,569
We have a good arrangement.
He makes the weapons, I use them.

566
01:07:56,489 --> 01:08:00,994
You know, my mother used to say,
"A cold heart is a dead heart."

567
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,139
You don't look so good.

568
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:27,228
I'm just a little tired. You know,
we've been working all night.

569
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:32,275
I guess we didn't catch it in time.

570
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,447
You got another day, two at the most.

571
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,536
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

572
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,624
You make it sound like I'm already dead.

573
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,268
Blade.

574
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,960
How you doing, chief?

575
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,172
Easy.

576
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,008
Wouldn't want our little friend here...

577
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,886
...to wind up on the back
of a milk carton, would we?

578
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,893
It's nice to finally meet you, man.
Had my eye on you for years.

579
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:54,065
I know all about you.
Your serum, Whistler, everything.

580
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,067
Sunblock.

581
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,528
Hey, it's a start, right?

582
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:02,281
The goal, of course, is to be like you.
A Day Walker.

583
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,952
You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?

584
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:09,997
All our strengths,
none of our weaknesses.

585
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,126
Well, maybe I don't see it that way.

586
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,170
Oh, so it's back to pretending
we're human again?

587
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:19,882
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, okay?

588
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:23,136
You can't keep denying what you are, man.

589
01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:28,141
You think the humans will ever accept
a half-breed like you? They can't.

590
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:30,435
They're afraid of you.

591
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,312
And they should be. You're an animal.

592
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,356
You're a fucking maniac.

593
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:42,196
Look at them. They're cattle.

594
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,198
Pieces of meat.

595
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:47,160
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

596
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:51,539
Plague, war, famine.

597
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:54,917
Morality doesn't even enter into it.

598
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:59,964
We're just a function of natural
selection, man. The new race.

599
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,134
Looks like your mascara's running.

600
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:14,270
I'm offering you a truce.
I want you with us.

601
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,190
What, do you think I'm stupid?

602
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,908
You're familiar with the blood god.

603
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,285
Frost...

604
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:32,288
...you're nothing to me...

605
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,333
...but another dead vampire.

606
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,085
You're an idiot, you know that?

607
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,546
I came down here offering
you an easy way out...

608
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,925
...and you spit it right back
in my fucking face.

609
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,552
Careful.

610
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,517
What do I care?

611
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:56,771
They're nothing but cattle,
just like you said.

612
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,483
If you wanna take the hard road,
be my guest, pal.

613
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,902
But I promise you,
by the time this is over...

614
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,572
...you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's womb.

615
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:41,941
Go home.

616
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,364
It's simple. Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

617
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:51,200
Because their own blood
can't sustain hemoglobin.

618
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,287
Right. So it's a genetic defect
just like hemolytic anemia.

619
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:57,081
That means that we have to treat it
with gene therapy.

620
01:12:57,248 --> 01:13:00,793
Rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

621
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,045
They've been using it
on sickle-cell anemia.

622
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,422
Are you sure that's safe?

623
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:08,801
I have no idea, but I don't
have a choice, do I?

624
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,763
You actually think this could work?

625
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,684
On me? Yes.

626
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:18,769
On Blade, I'm not so sure.

627
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:22,356
See, he didn't contract vampirism
from a bite like I did.

628
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:26,319
He was born with it.
It's part of his DNA.

629
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,907
I'm sure I can cure his thirst,
but it's gonna take time.

630
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,534
We're out of time.

631
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:36,412
You saw what was on that disk.

632
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,002
Damn.

633
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,546
Get out of here.

634
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,198
I said, get out of here.

635
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,707
Nice place. Took us a while to find it.

636
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,802
- Bite me and get it over with.
- I ain't gonna bite you.

637
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,359
Do your thing.

638
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,039
Whistler?

639
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,900
Frost took her.

640
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,868
Listen to me.

641
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,372
The disk...

642
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:27,208
...we decoded it.

643
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:33,964
Frost is trying to trigger
a fucking vampire apocalypse.

644
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:38,511
There's some kind of...

645
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:42,681
...vampire god he's trying to resurrect.

646
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:44,934
La Magra.

647
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,898
You're the key.

648
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:53,400
He needs your blood.

649
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:59,949
The blood of the Day Walker.

650
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:04,495
You're the chosen one.

651
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,417
Listen to me, Blade.

652
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:14,547
- You can't go after him.
- Bullshit.

653
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:20,010
If Frost gets his hands
on you, it's all over.

654
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:25,391
There'll be armies of the motherfuckers.

655
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,812
Shit.

656
01:17:33,732 --> 01:17:35,442
You're gonna have to finish me off.

657
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,738
Don't want me coming back.

658
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,658
We can treat the wounds.

659
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,036
It's too far gone.

660
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:49,331
You know that.

661
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,211
Give me your gun.

662
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:57,423
No.

663
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,135
Give me the goddamn gun.

664
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:29,914
Now walk away, you stupid son of a bitch.

665
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:37,087
Walk the fuck away.

666
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:01,779
<i>By the time you watch this,
your friend Whistler should be dead.</i>

667
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:05,157
<i>If it makes any difference to you,
he put up quite a fight.</i>

668
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,535
<i>You can find us at the Edgewood Towers.</i>

669
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,552
You seem a bit tense.

670
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,972
A bit pent-up maybe, like you
need to release something.

671
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:58,812
No? Blade not... giving it to you maybe?

672
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:02,024
I don't know, I just...

673
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:05,235
I see such a beautiful woman.

674
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:08,405
Great skin.

675
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,117
I'd like to see you happy, that's all.

676
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:16,288
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

677
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,500
Well, it's either that or a body bag.

678
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,795
Go ahead. Bite me.

679
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:25,798
I'll just cure myself.

680
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,967
I did it before, and I can do it again.

681
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:33,138
- There is no cure, baby.
- There is if you've been bitten.

682
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,808
If you were once human.

683
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,732
How'd you get that scar, Deacon?

684
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,985
A born vampire would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

685
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:50,197
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

686
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:52,699
Isn't that right?

687
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:55,411
Vampires like you aren't a species.

688
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,832
You're just infected, a virus,
a sexually-transmitted disease...

689
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,126
I'll tell you what we are, sister.

690
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:05,754
We're the top of the fucking food chain.
The blood god's coming...

691
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:09,758
...and after tonight,
you people are fucking history.

692
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:13,554
He's a hurricane, an act of God.

693
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:16,306
Anyone caught in his path
will instantly be turned.

694
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,185
Everyone you've ever known...

695
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:23,647
...everyone you've ever fucking loved.

696
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:27,109
It won't matter who's
pureblood and who's not.

697
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,737
How you gonna cure
the whole fucking world?

698
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:38,829
And Blade's blood is the key.

699
01:22:39,163 --> 01:22:40,622
We've got an intruder.

700
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,237
I don't think you understand.
This dude is bad.

701
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,448
He had 20 guys around him...
I was there.

702
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,284
- He's got shit he throws...
- He's got the sword and shit.

703
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:20,913
Yeah, he can throw it in the air,
catch it underneath. Shut the fuck up!

704
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,332
<i>There's no entrance
or exits where we are.</i>

705
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:25,584
Make it happen, all right?
It's one guy on foot.

706
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,923
Get him! Get him! Go!

707
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:32,424
That's him, get him!

708
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:54,446
Why am I hearing gunfire? Huh?

709
01:23:54,613 --> 01:23:57,658
Did I tell anybody to start shooting?
I need him alive.

710
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,160
No.

711
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,957
Please. I just work for them.

712
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:10,170
- Jesus Christ. Lock this place down.
- Yes, sir.

713
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,237
Eric?

714
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:11,958
But you died.

715
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:17,047
I came back, Eric.
That very same night.

716
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,552
And Deacon welcomed me into his arms.

717
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:40,487
Jesus Christ.
I thought you'd be happy.

718
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,826
You're finally being reunited with
your mother, and you act like this?

719
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:48,370
Blade, give it up. It's over.

720
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,373
She belongs to me, buddy.

721
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:54,960
Don't look so surprised.

722
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:59,756
You spent your whole life looking
for the vampire who bit your mother.

723
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:01,758
Well, here I am.

724
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,848
Who would have ever guessed
you'd survive your mother's death?

725
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:10,892
But you did, and here we are...

726
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,186
...one big happy fucking family.

727
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,534
I need my serum.

728
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:32,664
Maybe when we get out of this,
I'll take that miracle cure of yours.

729
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,416
There's one catch.

730
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,213
If it works...

731
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:45,802
...you'll lose your strength
and your ability to regenerate.

732
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,055
You'll be completely human.

733
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:29,596
Come here. Get up, damn it.

734
01:28:50,867 --> 01:28:54,496
Blade, Karen, glad you could make it.

735
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:58,124
Hey, man. Thanks for the shades.

736
01:28:59,543 --> 01:29:03,839
Our ancestors called this place
the Temple of Eternal Night.

737
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,176
Nice, isn't it?

738
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:11,805
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

739
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:14,099
Fortunately for us...

740
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:18,895
...I'm what you might call
a student of history.

741
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,743
Why are we here?

742
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:39,583
This temple was built
for one glorious moment:

743
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:44,045
This night, for the blood god.

744
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,722
Thanks.

745
01:29:57,851 --> 01:30:00,395
Let's see this sword of yours.

746
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,652
Titanium, right? Acid-etched?

747
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:12,032
I could get used to a weapon like this.

748
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:21,750
What? You look surprised.

749
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,629
I told you, Blade, I know
everything about you.

750
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:28,131
Hold out your arm, Quinn.

751
01:30:28,298 --> 01:30:30,550
Why, man?
Because they're, like, all better.

752
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:34,012
Hold out your arm. Now.

753
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,600
Deac, I...

754
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,856
Just kidding.

755
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,153
He was fucking with me, man.
He was, like, fucking with me.

756
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,988
Blade.

757
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:54,866
- Blade.
- He can't hear you, honey.

758
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:57,494
The thirst has got him now.

759
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:04,417
What do we have here?

760
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:07,128
The precious serum.

761
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:13,843
How long's it been since you shot up?
Twelve, 13 hours maybe?

762
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,347
I bet you're just dying
for a drink, aren't you?

763
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,227
What's it feel like?

764
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,980
Is your blood on fire?

765
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:27,649
Try some.

766
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:30,193
You might like it.

767
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,779
Thanks, but I prefer the real thing.

768
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:38,284
In any event, I don't think
you'll be needing these anymore.

769
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:49,045
It's a shame, you know?
When I think of what you've become...

770
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,840
...what you should have become.

771
01:31:52,215 --> 01:31:55,635
I guess I don't blame you. I mean,
with everything that's happened...

772
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:58,847
...it's the human side of you
that's made you weak.

773
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:03,059
- You should've listened to your blood.
- You can say what you want...

774
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:06,062
...but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

775
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:07,772
Ooh.

776
01:32:10,608 --> 01:32:11,985
Get him out of here.

777
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:18,783
Get these fucks downstairs. Now.

778
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:22,370
- Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on, now.

779
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,205
Come on.

780
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:29,711
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We haven't forgotten about you.

781
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:34,591
Oh, no, baby. We got something
real special planned for you.

782
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:37,594
Found me a surfer boy with a nice
ass and I sucked him dry.

783
01:32:37,761 --> 01:32:40,847
- And you'd figure he'd turn, right?
- But he didn't turn, did he?

784
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:45,351
No, he turned into some kind of zombie.
It happens sometimes, cutie.

785
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:48,688
- He was fucking tripped out.
- Pathetic.

786
01:32:48,855 --> 01:32:51,649
These guys are complete scum, man.
They'll eat anything.

787
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:55,570
Animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

788
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,406
...they'll even eat vampires.

789
01:32:58,573 --> 01:32:59,824
That's a plus.

790
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:04,120
And bearing that all in mind, I'd like
you to meet an old friend of yours.

791
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:13,213
It's too bad. I kind of liked her.

792
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,007
What a waste.

793
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,280
I don't know what's happening to me.

794
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:41,199
No pulse.

795
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:44,494
And, of course,
there's the question of lividity.

796
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:47,330
Curtis?

797
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,587
Karen?

798
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:56,756
Karen.

799
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:59,717
I never thought I would see you again.

800
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:03,263
Tell me, Karen, do you ever
have second thoughts about us?

801
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:23,324
Karen.

802
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,535
Karen.

803
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,078
Karen!

804
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:30,832
Karen!

805
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:32,625
Karen!

806
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:34,711
Karen!

807
01:35:39,525 --> 01:35:42,070
You poor child.

808
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,573
You're so sick.

809
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:48,618
So thirsty.

810
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,412
Don't touch me.

811
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:56,459
Eric, look at me.

812
01:35:56,709 --> 01:36:01,172
Vampires are my people now.
I'm one of them.

813
01:36:01,547 --> 01:36:03,716
Can't be.

814
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,886
Yes, it can.

815
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,933
Try to understand, Eric.

816
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:16,312
Your mother died a long time ago.

817
01:36:17,897 --> 01:36:20,149
I've hunted.

818
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,152
I've killed.

819
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:27,448
And I've enjoyed it.

820
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:30,118
Haven't you?

821
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,454
I know you have.

822
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:39,335
Sooner or later, the thirst always wins.

823
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,089
Come on.

824
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,096
Spread them out.

825
01:37:33,139 --> 01:37:36,142
One on each glyph, under the tombs.

826
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:37,977
Make it perfect.

827
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,269
Bring the elevator up.

828
01:39:00,226 --> 01:39:02,103
<i>You stupid girl.</i>

829
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:05,773
What do you think is going to happen?
La Magra? The blood god?

830
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,152
That's nothing more than a fairy
tale for pretty little vampires.

831
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:12,113
Then why are you sweating, pureblood?

832
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:14,824
Are you afraid we're
gonna steal your soul?

833
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:17,410
Your pureblood spirit?

834
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:21,038
You should be. Read the prophecy.

835
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:24,375
It's time you fucks contributed
something to the cause.

836
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:33,217
Even if Frost is right, you really
think he cares about you?

837
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:36,554
You're gonna die just
like the rest of us.

838
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:03,498
Blade.

839
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:15,426
Tonight, the Age of Man comes to an end.

840
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:17,678
No more compromises.

841
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,263
We're gonna be gods.

842
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,227
- Of course we are.
- Yeah.

843
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:30,399
I'm gonna be naughty.
I'm gonna be a naughty vampire god.

844
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,154
I'm right here.

845
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,451
Gotta stop...

846
01:40:40,785 --> 01:40:43,871
- Stop the...
- Save your strength.

847
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,873
Flow.

848
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:50,044
You're hypovolemic.
You're bleeding to death.

849
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:53,548
Need serum.

850
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:13,359
Blade.

851
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:16,028
Blade.

852
01:41:18,322 --> 01:41:20,324
Listen to me.

853
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:24,287
I want you to take some of my blood.

854
01:41:25,496 --> 01:41:27,540
No.

855
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:31,043
No.

856
01:41:31,335 --> 01:41:33,713
Look, just do it.

857
01:41:59,363 --> 01:42:00,906
Is everybody thirsty?

858
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:04,785
I hope you're all very fucking thirsty.

859
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:27,099
<i>Oh, please. Please, stop.</i>

860
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:31,729
Stop.

861
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:35,274
Oh, God.

862
01:42:36,609 --> 01:42:38,694
Don't stop.

863
01:42:52,291 --> 01:42:54,543
Don't stop.

864
01:42:58,089 --> 01:42:59,924
Oh, God.

865
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:47,138
How was it?

866
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:02,630
Eric, I'm your mother.

867
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:06,759
You wouldn't hurt your mother...

868
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:09,094
...would you?

869
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:12,932
Come here.

870
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:15,893
It's you and me.

871
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:18,938
I must release you.

872
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,659
Fuck!

873
01:46:35,723 --> 01:46:38,350
- Deacon?
- Not anymore.

874
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:56,785
Frost.

875
01:46:56,952 --> 01:46:59,663
- Kill him.
- Wait. I owe you, man.

876
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,373
I got two new hands, Blade.

877
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:04,209
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with.

878
01:47:25,064 --> 01:47:26,106
Frost.

879
01:48:11,860 --> 01:48:13,529
Frost!

880
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:50,065
I'm really going to enjoy this now.

881
01:49:38,781 --> 01:49:40,866
Hey, Blade.

882
01:49:42,993 --> 01:49:44,203
Let's do this.

883
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:37,923
<i>What the fuck?</i>

884
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:40,634
You're too late, Blade.

885
01:50:59,361 --> 01:51:01,155
My turn.

886
01:51:27,139 --> 01:51:29,600
Look at you. You're a little bitch.

887
01:51:31,393 --> 01:51:34,855
What, your serum?
Can't help you now, stud.

888
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:44,406
Nice shot.

889
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:19,942
Some motherfuckers are always
trying to ice skate uphill.

890
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:53,141
Blade.

891
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:03,527
Let's get out of here.

892
01:53:39,354 --> 01:53:43,442
I need to get back to the lab
if I'm gonna cure you.

893
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:46,320
It's not over.

894
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:48,613
You keep your cure.

895
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:53,493
There's still a war going on,
and I have a job to do.

896
01:53:54,036 --> 01:53:58,665
You wanna help?
Make me a better serum.
