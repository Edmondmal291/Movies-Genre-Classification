I've been meaning to talk with you.</font>

89

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's nice that you see me so much now, but--
- Don't start, Dad.</font>

90
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm only saying it's been... What? 4 years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?</font>

91
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 3 years.
- All right, 3, 4.</font>

This is not healthy.</font>

93
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Checkmate.</font>

95

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

96

102
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the hell's the point of having
a beeper, if you're not gonna turn it on?</font>

103
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was turned on. I was ignoring you.
Hello!</font>

105
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.</font>

106
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got static, we got snow,
all kinds of distortions.</font>

107
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Marty!

reason we have bins labeled "Recycle"!</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on?!
My God in heaven!</font>

110
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sue me. David! We got a problem!</font>

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you try to switch transponder channels?</font>

112
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please! You think I'd be this panicked,
if it was something simple?</font>

113
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's point the dish at another satellite.</font>

114
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We tried that. It didn't work.</font>

115
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's almost as though they weren't even there.</font>

116
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. What have we got here?</font>

117
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is impossible.</font>

120
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! Just leave it alone.
You'll break it, all right?</font>

121
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's so fuzzy.</font>

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucas' farm's on the other side of town!</font>

132
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>

133
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">CNS is running a story that we're covering up
some type of nuclear-testing experiment.</font>

134
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to run with it,
if they want to embarrass themselves.</font>

135
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NASA's been on my butt all morning.
They want to know our position.</font>

136
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our official position is...</font>

137
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have no official position.</font>

138
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Connie!
- What is going on here?</font>

139
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?</font>

140
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Absolutely.</font>

141
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I can't hear you.</font>

142
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the moment our satellites
are somewhat unreliable.</font>

143
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it possible that this thing
may just pass us by?</font>

144
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if it doesn't pass us by?</font>

145
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it out of the sky?</font>

146
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And risk turning one dangerous
falling object into many?</font>

147
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't yet know enough
about what we're dealing with</font>

148
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make any kind of intelligent judgments.</font>

149
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Luckily the press is making up
their own story at this point.</font>

150
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's not gonna keep.</font>

151
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.</font>

152
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General, contact NORAD. You tell them
we've upgraded to DEFCON 3.</font>

153
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what the president said.</font>

154
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't you think that's a little premature?
- I don't think so.</font>

155
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have over 50% of the armed forces
out on weekend leave.</font>

156
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to mention the commanders and troops
that are in town for the 4th of July parade.</font>

157
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead, Commander.</font>

158
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our intelligence tells us the object
has settled into a stationary orbit.</font>

159
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, that's good news.
- Not really, sir.</font>

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Part of it has broken off
into nearly 3 dozen other pieces.</font>

161
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Smaller than the whole, sir.</font>

162
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet over 15 miles in width themselves.</font>

163
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they heading?</font>

164
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They should be entering our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.</font>

165
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take us to DEFCON 3.</font>

166
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please tell me we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, there's good news and there's bad news.</font>

167
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. What's the bad news?</font>

168
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bad news is there's no penalty
for disturbing my lunch.</font>

169
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the good news is
you're not gonna charge me.</font>

170
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. The good news is that I found
the problem. It's not our equipment.</font>

171
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's some kind of weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.</font>

172
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, and that's the good news?</font>

173
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, 'cause this signal
has a definite sequential pattern.</font>

174
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, as soon as I find
the exact binary sequence,</font>

175
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I can calculate the phase reversal
with that analyser I bought for your birthday</font>

176
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and apply it,</font>

177
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we should be able to block it out completely.</font>

178
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then we'll be the only guys in town
with a clear picture!</font>

179
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, David!
That's why I love you!</font>

180
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh! That's not necessary.
- Yes!</font>

181
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Too kind.
- Yes!</font>

182
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This better be good.
- Admiral on deck!</font>

183
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, we're looking at a total
radar blackout over a 13 km area.</font>

184
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.</font>

185
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.</font>

186
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez!</font>

187
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me Atlantic Command on the line.</font>

188
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on, sir.</font>

189
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.</font>

190
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Second sighting?</font>

191
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. This just came in
from the Persian Gulf.</font>

192
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Correction, sir.</font>

193
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- <i>We now have two confirmed visual contacts.</i>
- Affirmative.</font>

194
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, they're tracking
another one off the California coastline!</font>

195
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, go ahead, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.</font>

196
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. I got this.</font>

197
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are
interrupting our regular broadcast</i></font>

hysteria that is causing are incredible.</i></font>

what you are seeing?</i></font>

201
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly</i></font>

205
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.</i></font>

206
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, we have an AWAC
off the West Coast.</font>

207
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ETA with contact point, 3 minutes.</font>

208
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.</font>

209
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering!</font>

210
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative. We have zero visibility.
Visibility is at zero.</font>

211
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.</font>

212
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain, the president is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.</font>

213
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We still have zero visibility.</i></font>

216
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wait a minute.</i></font>

217
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,550

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Line's gone, sir.</font>

220
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two more've been spotted over the Atlantic.</font>

221

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How much time do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alex, organize a military escort.</font>

224
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we move you to a secure location immediately.</font>

225
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Connie, can we expect the same
kind of panic we saw in Russia?</font>

226
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More than likely.</font>

227
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, we can discuss this
on the way.</font>

228
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not leaving.</font>

229
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to maintain a working
government in a time of crisis.</font>

230
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to take the president,
the whole cabinet, and the joint chiefs</font>

231
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and take them to a secured location.</font>

232
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm staying.</font>

233
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.</font>

234
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Connie...
- Yes, sir.</font>

235
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll initiate the emergency
broadcast system.</font>

236
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll advise people not to panic.</font>

237
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.</font>

238
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?
- Alex, contact the cabinet members,</font>

239
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have them rendez-vous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.</font>

240
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.</font>

241
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a feeling you would.</font>

242
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what happens
if they do become hostile?</font>

243
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then God help us.</font>

244
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.</i></font>

245
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It is apparently what has been causing
all the distortions in our broadcasts.</i></font>

246
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, are you watching this?</font>

247
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And that's no evidence these
phenomena are endangering anyone.</i></font>

248
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Thus far, reports of oppression...</i></font>

249
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marty, listen to this.</font>

250
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a lock on the pattern of that signal
and so we can filter it out.</font>

251
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if my calculations are right, it's gonna
be gone in, like, 7 hours anyway.</font>

252
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's reducing itself every time it recycles,</font>

253
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so eventually it's gonna disappear...</font>

254
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?</font>

255
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, haven't you been watching? David!</font>

256
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.</i></font>

906
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John Lennon. Smart man.</font>

907
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shot in the back, very sad.</font>

908
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've moved as many of our forces
away from our bases as possible.</font>

909
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we've already sustained heavy losses.</font>

910
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.</font>

911
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They agree we must launch a counter
offensive with a full nuclear strike.</font>

912
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over American soil?!</font>

913
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:37,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're saying at this point we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians? Is that right?</font>

914
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:41,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, if we don't strike soon, there may not
be much of an America left to defend!</font>

915
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir! They've taken out NORAD!</font>

916
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?!
- It's gone, sir.</font>

917
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God!</font>

918
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The vice president? The joint chiefs?</font>

919
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President...</font>

920
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must launch.</font>

921
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A delay now would be more costly than
when you waited to evacuate the cities.</font>

922
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. You're not gonna
launch nuclear weapons!</font>

923
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna kill them and us
at the same time. If we fire nukes...</font>

924
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...then everybody else who's got them, is gonna fire them.
- Sir, may I remind you</font>

925
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...that you are a guest here?
- You know what that means? Fallout!</font>

926
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever hear of nuclear winter?</font>

927
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's the end of life as we know it.
- David, you can't interfere with the conversation.</font>

928
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you hear what they're talking about?
- I know, I know.</font>

929
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't even think about it!
- Just go.</font>

930
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't have to go.
- You have to leave.</font>

931
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be allowed!</font>

932
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Hey, hey, don't tell him to shut up!</font>

933
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd all be dead now,
if it wasn't for my David!</font>

934
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of you did anything to prevent this!</font>

935
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.</font>

936
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't give me unprepared!
- Come on, Julius.</font>

937
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was, what? In the 19... What? ...50s,
whatever, you had that spaceship.</font>

938
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:37,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad, look, Dad...
- Yeah, that thing that you found in New Mexico!</font>

939
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad!
- Where was that?</font>

940
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not the spaceship.</font>

941
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Roswell! Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah!
- Don't do this.</font>

942
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you had the spaceship
and you had the bodies!</font>

943
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They were locked up in a bunker.
- Come on.</font>

944
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where was that?
- David?</font>

945
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Area 51! Right?
- I don't know.</font>

946
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Area 51! You knew then!
And you did nothing.</font>

947
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir....</font>

948
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Regardless of what you may
have read in the tabloids,</font>

949
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.</font>

950
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.</font>

951
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's no recovered spaceship.</font>

952
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Mr. President.</font>

953
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:14,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not entirely accurate.</font>

954
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Which part?</font>

955
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, everybody! Hold on!</font>

956
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

957
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The end hath come!</font>

958
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:55,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He spaketh His word,
and the end hath come!</font>

959
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hop on! We're heading out to El Toro!</font>

960
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot defy what hath come!</font>

961
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is the end!</font>

962
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">El Toro?!</font>

963
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure.</font>

964
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:30,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

965
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:40,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, let's get this off.</font>

966
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, let me help you.</font>

967
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's hurt pretty badly.</font>

968
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.</font>

969
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, no!</font>

970
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:02,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got me out here, dragging your
heavy ass through the burning desert</font>

971
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your dreadlocks sticking
out the back of my parachute.</font>

972
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:08,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta come down here with an attitude,</font>

973
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">acting all big and bad.</font>

974
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what the hell is that smell?!</font>

975
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've been at a barbecue!</font>

976
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I ain't mad.</font>

977
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right. It's all right.</font>

978
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

979
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey!</font>

980
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

981
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you need a lift, soldier?</font>

982
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.</font>

983
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It ain't on the map.</font>

984
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me, it's there.</font>

985
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ten hut!</font>

986
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, General.</font>

987
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.</font>

988
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're now 24 floors beneath the surface,</font>

989
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and... here's our main research facility.</font>

990
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see it.</font>

991
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, sir, it's a clean room.
It's to keep it static free.</font>

992
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- If we'd all get to decontamination...
- Open the door.</font>

993
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

994
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God!</font>

995
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?</font>

996
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:32,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.</font>

997
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?</font>

998
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you get funding
for something like this?</font>

999
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer,</font>

1000
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?</font>

1001
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.</font>

1002
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's been heading up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.</font>

1003
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do?</font>

1004
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President!</font>

1005
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

1006
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This...</font>

1007
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:10,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a pleasure!</font>

1008
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can imagine, they...</font>

1009
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't let us out much.</font>

1010
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can understand that.</font>

1011
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:20,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1012
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:24,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?</font>

1013
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

1014
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:19,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a beaut, ain't she?</font>

1015
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you can see from the repairs,</font>

1016
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:26,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've been trying to put her back
together since the late 1960s.</font>

1017
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell me you've had this for 40 years
and you don't know anything about them.</font>

1018
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hell, no! No, no, no, no, no!</font>

1019
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know tons about them.</font>

1020
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the neatest stuff...</font>

1021
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The neatest stuff has only happened
in the last few days.</font>

1022
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:44,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, we can't duplicate their type of power,
so we've never been able to experiment.</font>

1023
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:49,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.</font>

1024
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last 24 hours have been really exciting!</font>

1025
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exciting?! People are dying out there.</font>

1026
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think "exciting" is the word
I'd choose to describe it!</font>

1027
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?</font>

1028
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you can repair their technology.</font>

1029
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you tell us anything useful about them?</font>

1030
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I mean...</font>

1031
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:12,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not all that dissimilar from us.</font>

1032
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:16,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.</font>

1033
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably why they're interested in our planet.</font>

1034
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1035
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1036
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys wanna see them?</font>

1037
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1038
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is...</font>

1039
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the vault.</font>

1040
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or, as some of us have come to call it...</font>

1041
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the freak show.</font>

1042
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we found them,</font>

1043
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they were wearing some sort
of biomechanical suits.</font>

1044
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:17,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once we got them off, we learned
a great deal about their anatomy.</font>

1045
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eyes, ears,</font>

1046
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no vocal cords.</font>

1047
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are assuming they communicate
with each other through some other means.</font>

1048
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're obviously not thinking about
hand signals and body language.</font>

1049
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:33,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's some kind of extrasensory
perception, telepathy.</font>

1050
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

1051
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's an organic life form.</font>

1052
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can they be killed?</font>

1053
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their bodies are just as frail as ours.</font>

1054
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these two died in the crash.</font>

1055
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one a few weeks later.</font>

1056
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just... You have to get through
their technology, which is...</font>

1057
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:58,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.</font>

1058
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:03,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, you unlocked part of their technology.</font>

1059
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cracked the code.</font>

1060
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no. All I did was stumble onto their...</font>

1061
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...signal. I don't know how helpful I can be.</font>

1062
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?</font>

1063
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.</font>

1064
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:23,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.</font>

1065
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What code?</font>

1066
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.</font>

1067
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, captain. This is a restricted area.
I can't let you pass without clearance.</font>

1068
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:04,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Come here.</font>

1069
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna see my clearance?</font>

1070
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:12,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let them pass.</font>

1071
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:16,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let them pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!</font>

1072
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:19,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see that?</font>

1073
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on down.</font>

1074
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch your step.</font>

1075
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:28,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, obviously this cockpit
was designed to seat three.</font>

1076
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Though how they sat on them, I don't know.</font>

1077
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:32,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gently.</font>

1078
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You see these gizmos flashing?
- Yeah.</font>

1079
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been working around the clock
trying to get a fix on all this crap.</font>

1080
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some stuff we figured out right away.</font>

1081
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This we're pretty sure is the life
support system for the cabin.</font>

1082
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this doohickey is connected to...</font>

1083
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:54,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here, take that, will you?</font>

1084
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:59,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These configurations...</font>

1085
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:05,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, to be honest, we don't know
what the hell this crap is.</font>

1086
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:11,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But this is clearly what they use
to guide and navigate their craft.</font>

1087
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neat, huh?</font>

1088
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:18,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could somebody grab my laptop there?
Can I just have the computer inside?</font>

1089
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- See these patterns here?</font>

1090
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are repeating sequentially,
just like their countdown signal.</font>

1091
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're using that frequency
for computer communications.</font>

1092
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? That's how
they're coordinating their ships.</font>

1093
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know...</font>

1094
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're really starting to make us look bad.</font>

1095
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got one! They got one alive!</font>

1096
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They got one, alive!
- Jesus!</font>

1097
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be okay by yourself, Dave?</font>

1098
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fine by it.
- Yeah.</font>

1099
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't touch anything.</font>

1100
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody's always telling me
not to touch anything.</font>

1101
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, here.</font>

1102
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! It's all wet.</font>

1103
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right here. We got him
in the back of the pickup.</font>

1104
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General, sir. Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.</font>

1105
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess who's coming to dinner!</font>

1106
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:30,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a doctor. I need a doctor!</font>

1107
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy! Oh, boy! How long
has he been unconscious?</font>

1108
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- About 3 hours.
- Let's get him in containment, stat!</font>

1109
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son, he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention!</font>

1110
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.</font>

1111
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:47,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has a problem with his adrenal cortex.
Please!</font>

1112
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't do something about it
right now, my son will die!</font>

1113
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:57,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, just help him!
- Okay. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.</font>

1114
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, take us to him, okay? Let's go.</font>

1115
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right! Move it, move it, move it!</font>

1116
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:09,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.</font>

1117
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When were you planning
on informing the rest of us?</font>

1118
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It had been deemed classified.</font>

1119
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have told us about this
when they first arrived!</font>

1120
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack</font>

1121
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that cost the lives of hundreds
of American pilots!</font>

1122
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no way that we could have known</font>

1123
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that our fighters would have been
that ineffective against their attackers.</font>

1124
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President.</font>

1125
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The little bit of information we have comes
directly into this room, Mr. President.</font>

1126
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:35,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.</font>

1127
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Destroyed.</font>

1128
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We learned that NATO and Western Allied
installations were the first to be taken out.</font>

1129
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we were hit.</font>

1130
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:46,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They knew exactly where and how to hit us.</font>

1131
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And our forces?
- We're down to 15%.</font>

1132
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:53,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on,</font>

1133
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:57,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're looking at the worldwide
destruction of every major city...</font>

1134
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:01,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the next 36 hours.</font>

1135
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're being exterminated.</font>

1136
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President...</font>

1137
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:13,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Captain Steven Hiller.</font>

1138
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Captain.
- Mr. President.</font>

1139
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:15,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done!</font>

1140
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is it now?</font>

1141
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have it isolated down
in the containment lab, sir.</font>

1142
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to go see it.</font>

1143
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:31,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.</font>

1144
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hasn't anyone told you?</font>

1145
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">El Toro has been completely destroyed.</font>

1146
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:36,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We were lucky.
- Yeah!</font>

1147
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today was the first time I used the subway.</font>

1148
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank God for the Metro Rail.</font>

1149
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:44,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These should last us a while.</font>

1150
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move. I'll get it for you. Stay still.</font>

1151
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's your son?</font>

1152
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's my angel.</font>

1153
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:55,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was his father stationed here?</font>

1154
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he...</font>

1155
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:00,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wasn't his father.</font>

1156
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.</font>

1157
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:11,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.</font>

1158
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Ballet!</font>

1159
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Exotic.</font>

1160
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:21,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Sorry.</font>

1161
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be. I'm not.</font>

1162
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:27,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good money. Besides...</font>

1163
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My baby's worth it.</font>

1164
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dylan, come here.</font>

1226
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or, you know, for your career.</font>

1227
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it wasn't just my career.</font>

1228
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:41,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the biggest opportunity of my life.</font>

1229
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:46,100

1234
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:00,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?</font>

1235
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was part of something special.</font>

1236
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it makes any difference,</font>

01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:50,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?</font>

1299
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Abort mission right away.</font>

1300
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jasmine!</font>

1301
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're late!</font>

1302
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I like to make an entrance.</font>

1303
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:00,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.</font>

1304
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.</font>

1305
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:08,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier--
- Hey, there she is! Go on!</font>

1306
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:14,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally, Mr. President.</font>

1307
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:18,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier--
- Wait a minute. What are you saying?</font>

1308
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't stop the bleeding.</font>

1309
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we'd...</font>

1310
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing we can do for her.</font>

1311
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.</font>

1312
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've gotten bigger, I think.</font>

1313
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I did?
- Mm-hm.</font>

1314
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just keep growing and growing.</font>

1315
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't...</font>

1316
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1317
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you wait outside for a little bit,
so mom can get a rest?</font>

1318
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come on, Munchkin.</font>

1319
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.</font>

1320
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:14,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1321
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:18,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The doctors...</font>

1322
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:22,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">think that you're...</font>

1323
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gonna be just fine.</font>

1324
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liar.</font>

1325
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:27,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Mommy sleeping now?</font>

1326
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1327
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy's sleeping.</font>

1328
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1329
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David!</font>

1330
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making a mess!</font>

1331
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. This I can see.</font>

1332
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta burn the rainforest
with toxic waste,</font>

1333
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pollute the air and rip up the ozone layer!</font>

1334
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:24,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough...</font>

1335
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they won't want it anymore.</font>

1336
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:29,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait. David, David!</font>

1337
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.</font>

1338
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you listening to me?
- I'm listening.</font>

1339
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.</font>

1340
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:38,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David! Even myself.</font>

1341
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.</font>

1342
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, sometimes...</font>

1343
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have to remember what we still have.</font>

1344
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like what?</font>

1345
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:01,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well... you still have your health.</font>

1346
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, David, you need your rest. Come on!</font>

1347
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:08,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off this freezing concrete floor
before you catch a cold. Come on.</font>

1348
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:14,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you just say?
- You mean about faith?</font>

1349
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:16,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, you see, a man can live his life--
- No, no, no.</font>

1350
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the other part.</font>

1351
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:21,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What? I don't want you to catch cold.</font>

1352
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:29,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that? What's the matter with you?</font>

1353
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:32,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Genius.
- Genius?</font>

1354
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dad. A total genius.</font>

1355
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:39,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jerry, wake up.</font>

1356
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:42,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.</font>

1357
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that!</font>

1358
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?</font>

1359
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.</font>

1360
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, they're here.
- All right, Connie, what's this all about?</font>

1361
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no idea.</font>

1362
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:01,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get everybody off.</font>

1363
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:04,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, everybody. Clear the platform.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.</font>

1364
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Major Mitchell...</font>

1365
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have a pistol?
- What?</font>

1366
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:11,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.</font>

1367
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:15,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that Coke can on top of the alien craft?</font>

1368
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think you can shoot that thing off?</font>

1369
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it. Shoot it.</font>

1370
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir?
- Go ahead.</font>

1371
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you doing?!</font>

1372
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.</font>

1373
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.</font>

1374
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:39,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We can't penetrate their defenses.
- We know that already. What's your point?</font>

1375
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. My point is, if we can't beat their defenses,
then we gotta get around them.</font>

1376
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:47,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Major, one more time... Any time.</font>

1377
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.</font>

1378
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:06,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave it a virus. A computer virus.</font>

1379
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you telling us you can send out a signal</font>

1380
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that will disable all their shields?</font>

1381
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:14,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right. Just like they used
our satellites against us,</font>

1382
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can use their own signal against them.</font>

1383
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we plant a virus into that mother ship,</font>

1384
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's gonna then filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.</font>

1385
01:46:24,150 --> 01:46:25,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I don't understand.</font>

1386
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:30,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just how exactly do we infect
the mother ship with this virus?</font>

1387
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:33,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're... We're gonna...</font>

1388
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:38,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have to... fly their alien craft out of
our atmosphere and dock with it.</font>

1389
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.</font>

1390
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We then upload the virus.</font>

1391
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We then set off some kind of explosion,
which will disable it.</font>

1392
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that'll disorient the smaller ships below.</font>

1393
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:53,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that could buy you,
I think at least, some time to...</font>

1394
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to take them... take them out...
take them down.</font>

1395
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do your... Do your stuff.</font>

1396
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:04,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?</font>

1397
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. A matter of minutes.</font>

1398
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:11,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want us to coordinate
a massive worldwide counterstrike</font>

1399
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a window of only a few minutes?!</font>

1400
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:17,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- With shields down, that might be possible.
- Oh, please!</font>

1401
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:21,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!</font>

1402
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not to mention that this whole
cockamamie plan</font>

1403
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:27,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is dependent on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.</font>

1404
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:30,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't say that, sir.</font>

1405
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:34,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen these things in action. And I'm well
aware of their maneuvering capabilities.</font>

1406
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With your permission, general,
I'd like the opportunity to try.</font>

1407
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing is a wreck!</font>

1408
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It crash-landed back in the '50s!</font>

1409
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:46,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't even know if it's capable of flying!</font>

1410
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:48,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, remove the clamps.</font>

1411
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:12,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any questions?</font>

1412
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:19,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do it.</font>

1413
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:24,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you heard the president,
let's get this thing preped and ready to fly!</font>

1414
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr. President.</font>

1415
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A virus!</font>

1416
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:32,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your idea.</font>

1417
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

1418
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:43,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really think you can fly that thing?</font>

1419
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really think you can do
all that bullshit you just said?</font>

1420
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand you are upset
over the death of your wife.</font>

1421
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:01,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that's no excuse for making
another fatal mistake.</font>

1422
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! The only mistake I ever made</font>

1423
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:06,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was to appoint a sniveling little weasel
like you as Secretary of Defense.</font>

1424
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't think you understand!
- However!</font>

1425
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:13,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is one mistake I am thankful
to say that I don't have to live with.</font>

1426
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. President, please!
- Mr. Nimziki...</font>

1427
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're fired.</font>

1428
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:24,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.</font>

1429
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:25,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1430
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:27,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He can't do that.</font>

1431
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:30,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he just... did.</font>

1432
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Command has attempted to compile
a list of casualties and losses,</font>

1433
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:38,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but information is sketchy at best.</font>

1434
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sina.</font>

1435
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:45,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a strong possibility ther may be more
reinforcements hiding in the Golan Straits.</font>

1436
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's he saying?</font>

1437
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It seems they're getting a signal.
Old Morse code.</font>

1438
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's from the Americans!</font>

1439
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They want to organize a counter offensive!</font>

1440
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?</font>

1441
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:40,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions</font>

1442
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.</font>

1443
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's impressive. Considering
it's all being done with...</font>

1444
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:47,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morse code.</font>

1445
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:48,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The armed forces here?</font>

1446
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have sufficient aircraft
for the battleplan, but...</font>

1447
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:54,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- But what?
- Pilots are coming up short.</font>

1448
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then, find them.</font>

1449
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ham radio operators
from New York to Japan</i></font>

1450
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:01,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>trade rumors of military forces in hiding</i></font>

1451
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:05,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation.</i></font>

1452
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we're planning at this time
is to launch a counter offensive.</font>

1453
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:11,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, with our depleted manpower,</font>

1454
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:14,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're asking that anyone with any
flight experience come forward.</font>

1455
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:19,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Military training is preferable, but anyone
who can fly a plane would be useful.</font>

1456
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can fly. I'm a pilot.</font>

1457
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, guys, listen up!
- All right, pay close attention.</font>

1458
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These F-18s are very different
than the jets you piloted before.</font>

1459
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's kind of strong.
- You have to forgive the expression,</font>

1460
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you're about to get a crash course
in modern avionics.</font>

1461
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Keep it coming. Keep it, keep it.
- Okay, you got it!</font>

1462
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, listen up. Before we can begin,
we're gonna have to get</font>

1463
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a little background information
on your flight experience.</font>

1464
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:47,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's start with you.</font>

1465
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:48,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who, me?</font>

1466
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm Russell Casse, sir.</font>

1467
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:58,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, after 'Nam, I got into crop-dusting.</font>

1468
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And... been doing that ever since.</font>

1469
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:06,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that...</font>

1470
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:11,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago,</font>

1471
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:13,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have been dying for some payback.</font>

1472
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:17,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I just want you to know that...
I won't let you down.</font>

1473
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have one tactical nuclear missile</font>

1474
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:24,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're loading into this launcher
we're installing under the right wing.</font>

1475
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the firing mechanism.</font>

1476
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be attached to the ship's main console.</font>

1477
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:31,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like the Amraam launch pad on a Stealth.</font>

1478
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:34,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.</font>

1479
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.</font>

1480
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:40,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, gentlemen.</font>

1481
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 seconds.</font>

1482
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, tell me.</font>

1483
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's the strongest radio transmitter
we could get.</font>

1484
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.</font>

1485
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:50,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it a little too close?</font>

1486
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:54,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! We're gonna be well on our way
back home before we shoot that thing off.</font>

1487
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you? David!</font>

1488
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't... Excuse me. I don't understand...</font>

1489
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:04,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why you can't show someone else
how to plant the virus.</font>

1490
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Someone who is trained.
- No. No, something may go wrong.</font>

1491
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:10,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may have to think quickly, adjust the signal.</font>

1492
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:14,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who knows? Hey, you know how like
I'm always trying to save the planet?</font>

1493
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:20,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's my chance.</font>

1494
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now he gets ambitious.</font>

1495
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:28,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.</font>

1496
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. All right, I guess that's good enough.</font>

1497
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So... How do I look?</font>

1498
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.</font>

1499
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:42,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're late!
- Well, you know me.</font>

1500
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:45,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. You like to make a big entrance.</font>

1501
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:50,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen... Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.</font>

1502
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:52,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for what, babe?</font>

1503
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:56,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have done this a long time ago.</font>

1504
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:59,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have the ring?
- Yes, sir.</font>

1505
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:02,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, make yourself useful.</font>

1506
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:06,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witnesses?</font>

1507
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:13,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.</font>

1508
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:17,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God</font>

1509
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:20,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in the presence of these witnesses</font>

1510
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:23,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.</font>

1511
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:27,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed,</font>

1512
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:31,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please speak now
or forever hold your peace.</font>

1513
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:37,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife</font>

1514
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:40,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?</font>

1515
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:46,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health</font>

1516
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, forsaking all others,</font>

1517
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:52,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?</font>

1518
01:54:53,150 --> 01:54:55,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will.</font>

1519
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

1520
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're a little young.</font>

1521
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:17,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That they are.</font>

1522
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They look a little nervous.</font>

1523
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need all flight crews to report
to their designated areas immediately.</font>

1524
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Major, can I borrow that?
- Sir.</font>

1525
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>

1526
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:34,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Good morning.</i></font>

1527
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In less than an hour...</font>

1528
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:44,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">aircraft from here will join
others from around the world.</font>

1529
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:50,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.</font>

1530
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:53,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mankind.</font>

1531
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:57,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That word should have
new meaning for all of us today.</font>

1532
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:01,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.</font>

1533
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:06,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will be united in our common interest.</font>

1534
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:11,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps it's fate that
today is the 4th of July.</font>

1535
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.</font>

1536
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:20,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not from tyranny,
oppression or persecution.</font>

1537
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But from annihilation.</font>

1538
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're fighting for our right to live.</font>

1539
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To exist.</font>

1540
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And should we win the day,</font>

1541
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:39,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the 4th of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday,</font>

1542
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:44,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but as the day when the world
declared in one voice...</font>

1543
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:47,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We will not go quietly into the night!</font>

1544
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:50,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We will not vanish without a fight!</font>

1545
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:53,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We're going to live on!</font>

1546
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:56,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"We're going to survive!"</font>

1547
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!</font>

1548
01:57:26,050 --> 01:57:28,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go!
- Mr. President. Right this way, sir.</font>

1549
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got your gear over here.</font>

1550
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck!</font>

1551
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:34,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got you a jumpsuit for you, and the rest
of your gear is stored away in this duffel.</font>

1552
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:35,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got your choice of helmets.</font>

1553
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:41,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. President, I'd sure like to know
what you're doing.</font>

1687
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:52,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

1688
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:56,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eagle Seven, fox two.</font>

1689
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eagle Three, fox two.</font>

1690
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:08,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're just not causing enough damage.</font>

1691
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:09,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's settling directly over us.</font>

1692
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon.</font>

1693
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:24,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then let's take it out
before it takes us out.</font>

1694
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Target at 12 o'clock.</font>

1695
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:35,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God, they're everywhere!</font>

1696
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:39,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bandits on our tail! They're locked on!
- I see them. I see them.</font>

1697
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:44,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, squadron leaders,
I want a weapons check.</font>

1698
02:12:46,350 --> 02:12:48,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're out of time!
You've gotta disable it now!</font>

1699
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:54,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in range. Locking on.</font>

1700
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!</font>

1701
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:09,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a negative impact.</font>

1702
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:11,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That is an NI. Negative impact.</i></font>

1703
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:14,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!</font>

1704
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on it.</font>

1705
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:20,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus!</font>

1706
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:24,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, all missiles have been fired.</font>

1707
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're out of time!
Get your ass out of there!</font>

1708
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:28,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!</font>

1709
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?</font>

1710
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:33,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sorry I'm late, Mr. President!</i></font>

1711
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of got hung up back there!</font>

1712
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:41,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!</font>

1713
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm packing!</font>

1714
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:47,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.</font>

1715
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pilot, identify yourself.
- <i>It's me!</i></font>

1716
02:13:49,650 --> 02:13:51,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Russell Casse, sir.</i></font>

1717
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:54,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you I wouldn't let you down!</font>

1718
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:57,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will you?</i></font>

1719
02:13:57,450 --> 02:14:01,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven,
take flanking positions.</font>

1720
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to look after this guy, okay?</font>

1721
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:07,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!</font>

1722
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:09,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!</font>

1723
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll draw them off and it'll be all yours!</font>

1724
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look out! Coming through!</font>

1725
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:25,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got tone.</font>

1726
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:30,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eagle Twenty. Fox two.</font>

1727
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:39,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eagle Twenty. Fox two.</font>

1728
02:14:42,650 --> 02:14:44,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's jammed.</font>

1729
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:46,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It won't fire.</i></font>

1730
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

1731
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do me a favor.</font>

1732
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:10,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell my children I love them very much.</font>

1733
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you alien assholes!</font>

1734
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:18,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the words of my generation...</font>

1735
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:23,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up yours!</font>

1736
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:24,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad! What's he doing?</font>

1737
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:26,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come on, baby!</i></font>

1738
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:28,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, baby, come on!</font>

1739
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:33,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck, buddy.</font>

1740
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, boys!</font>

1741
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:48,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm back!</font>

1742
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:08,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did it!</font>

1743
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:10,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The son of a bitch did it!</font>

1744
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!</font>

1745
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:39,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What your father did was very brave.</font>

1746
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:43,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be proud of him.</font>

1747
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:45,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am.</font>

1748
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:05,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we know how to take them out, general.</font>

1749
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spread the word.</font>

1750
02:17:10,350 --> 02:17:13,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.</font>

1751
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.</font>

1752
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

1753
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:35,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Checkmate.</font>

1754
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:04,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's funny. I always thought
that things like these would kill me.</font>

1755
02:18:09,050 --> 02:18:10,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1756
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:19,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a pleasure.</font>

1757
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve, you too.</font>

1758
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one thing left to do.</font>

1759
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready?</font>

1760
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

1761
02:18:44,450 --> 02:18:47,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, all right! Look at us!</font>

1762
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:51,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!</font>

1763
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all take care, all right?</font>

1764
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:53,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nothing but love for you!
- Goodbye!</font>

1765
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:54,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing but love for you.</font>

1766
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think they have any clue
what's about to happen to them?</font>

1767
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:00,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a chance in hell. Good night!</font>

1768
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:09,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Peace!</font>

1769
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:25,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 30 seconds?</font>

1770
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't heard no fat lady!</font>

1771
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:29,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forget the fat lady. You're obessed
with the fat lady. Drive us out of here!</font>

1772
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really! You think?</font>

1773
02:19:48,650 --> 02:19:50,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.</font>

1774
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:52,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not hit! We're not hit!
Stop side-seat driving!</font>

1775
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:58,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit, exit, left!</font>

1776
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:01,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where the hell do you think I'm going?
- Okay, okay. We're...</font>

1777
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:21,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-oh. They're closing up on us.</font>

1778
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that closing?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!</font>

1779
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:28,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!</font>

1780
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:41,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elvis has left the building!</font>

1781
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.</font>

1782
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:45,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, man.</font>

1783
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:20,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're going down all over the world,
Tom. We got them beat.</font>

1784
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:22,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?</font>

1785
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:32,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.</font>

1786
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:36,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it!</font>

1787
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.</font>

1788
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:28,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, sir.</font>

1789
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good job.
- Thank you.</font>

1790
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:33,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well done, captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.</font>

1791
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:42,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David...</font>

1792
02:23:44,650 --> 02:23:46,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bad.</font>

1793
02:23:49,550 --> 02:23:52,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Mr. President.</font>

1794
02:23:53,050 --> 02:23:54,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not too bad at all.</font>

1795
02:23:56,050 --> 02:23:58,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, so this is healthy?</font>

1796
02:23:58,650 --> 02:24:00,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I could get used to it.</font>

1797
02:24:18,550 --> 02:24:21,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy 4th of July, Daddy.</font>

1798
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:23,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same to you, Munchkin.</font>

1799
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't I promise you fireworks?</font>

1800
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:29,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
