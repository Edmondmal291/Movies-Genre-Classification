1
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:39,213
Hey! Yo!
False alarm! Hold it!

2
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:40,294
It's ok! I'm here.

3
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:41,411
Here we are!

4
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:42,632
It's alright.

5
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:44,775
Yeah.
Set it down nice and easy?

6
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:46,358
Yeah, sure. At the impound.

7
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,837
Next time read the sign.

8
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,102
Hey! You don't understand. Look.

9
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:50,593
I'm just here to meet my wife's plane.

10
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:52,068
You got to let me have this car.

11
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,012
Yeah, sure. Tomorrow, 8:00 to 4:00.
You pay 40 bucks, we give it back.

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,781
Don't write it up!
Don't write it up!

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,708
Come on, man.

14
00:00:57,747 --> 00:00:59,277
This is my mother-in-law's car, alright?

15
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:01,003
She's already mad at me
because I'm not a dentist.

16
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:04,306
Look, I'm a cop L.A.P.D.
How about a little team spirit?

17
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,578
Oh, I was in L.A. once.

18
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:06,725
Hated it.

19
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:08,651
Well, I can understand.
I don't like it much myself.

20
00:01:08,653 --> 00:01:10,718
Hey! That's a plastic fender up there!

21
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,749
Take it easy!
Back off!

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,748
I'm doing my job!
Cut me some slack, will you?

23
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,571
Look, I used to be a cop in New York City.

24
00:01:15,573 --> 00:01:17,618
I only moved to L.A. because
my wife took a job there.

25
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,405
Come on.
What do you say?

26
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:22,590
Here we are. Washington, D.C.,
the heart of democracy.

27
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:24,013
One hand washes the other.

28
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,056
Come on, man.
It's Christmas.

29
00:01:26,303 --> 00:01:28,433
So ask Santa Claus
to give you another car.

30
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:30,423
Merry Christmas, pal.

31
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:33,789
It's all yours, Murray.

32
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:39,282
Son of a bitch.

33
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,722
Hi. Where are the telephones?
Right over there.

34
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:24,463
Thank you.

35
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:27,346
<i>Thank you, Fred.

hotter by the minute.</i>

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,444
<i>Security was tight today at Escalon Airport
in the Republic of Val Verde,</i>

38

<i>where government authorities report
that deposed general Ramon Esperanza,</i>

39
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,722
<i>will be delivered for immediate
extradition to the United States.</i>

40
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,300
<i>Only two years ago General Esperanza,</i>

41
00:02:43,302 --> 00:02:46,652
<i>led his country's army in a campaign
against communist insurgents.</i>

42
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:49,861
<i>A campaign fought with
American money and advisers.</i>

43
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:52,527
<i>Esperanza's fall from power caused ripples</i>

44
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:54,458
<i>not only in his country's recent election</i>

45
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,426
<i>but closer to home as well,</i>

46
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,140
<i>when high-ranking Pentagon
officials were charged</i>

47
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:02,221
<i>with supplying him with weapons
despite the congressional ban.</i>

48
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,960
<i>But mounting evidence
that Esperanza's forces</i>

49
00:03:04,974 --> 00:03:07,225
<i>violated the neutrality
of neighboring countries</i>

50

<i>made Congress withhold funds.</i>

51

<i>Funds which Esperanza
is accused of replacing</i>

52
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:15,005
<i>by going into the lucrative
business of cocaine smuggling.</i>

53
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,951
<i>Although Esperanza was removed</i>

54
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,911
<i>as commander in chief earlier this year.</i>

55
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:22,439
<i>The agreement to extradite him
was not reached until yesterday,</i>

56
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,266
<i>and Washington insiders say
it was a phone call that made it happen.</i>

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,985
<i>A phone call from a...</i>

58
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:34,398
Alright. Alright.

59
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,731
If I could find a phone,
I'd call you, whoever you are.

60
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:15,342
Excuse me.
Thank you.

61
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:27,066
<i>Yes, this is Lieutenant McClane.
Somebody there just beep me?</i>

62
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,541

63
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,574
<i>Honey!</i>

64
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:31,460
What are you doing?
Where are you? Did you land yet?

65
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,468
Honey, it's the '90s, remember?

66
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:38,005
Microchips, microwaves,
faxes, air phones.

67
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:41,163
Yeah, well, as far as I'm concerned,

68
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,166
progress peaked with frozen pizza.

69
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,386
Listen now,

70
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:46,909
we're gonna be about half
an hour late landing, ok?

71
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:48,915
I just wanted to let you know.

72
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,013
The kids ok?

73
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,093
Well, they're about to lose their minds,

74
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,949
from all the sugar your parents
are giving them.

75
00:04:54,853 --> 00:04:57,069
Did Mom give you a hard time
about borrowing her new car?

76
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:58,452
<i>No.</i>

77
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,643
<i>Not yet.</i>

78
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:01,580
Listen honey, when you land,

79
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,085
can we, can we just like...

80
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:04,369
you know rent a car,

81
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,225
check into a hotel?

82
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:07,654
Leave the kids with your parents.

83
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:09,889
Order some room service,

84
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,229

85
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:12,607

86
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:14,578
You're on, Lieutenant.

87
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,764
I'll see you in about
a half an hour, honey.

88
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:18,147
I love you. Bye.

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,674
Isn't technology wonderful?

90
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,868
My husband doesn't think so.

91
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,379
Well, I do.

92
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,942
I used to carry around
those awful Mace things.

93
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,400
Now...

94
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,265
I zap any bastard that screws with me.

95
00:05:43,894 --> 00:05:45,441
I tried it on my little dog.

96
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,406
Poor thing limped for a week.

97
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:58,122
Excuse me.

98
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,887
Boy, you look really familiar to me.

99
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:03,552
I get that a lot.

100
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,843
I've been on TV.

101
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,680
Yeah. Me too.

102
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:32,771
Grab the tools, will you?

103
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:33,739

00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,828
Scotch, straight up, please.
Excuse me, Officers.

162
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,140
This may sound like a wild-goose chase,
but I think I just saw...

163
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,403
Saw what?

164
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:24,782
Elvis.

165
00:10:25,548 --> 00:10:26,786
Elvis Presley.

166
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:30,582
Fucking tourists.

167
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:31,805
Ought to be a law.
Can I get you something else?

168
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,837
Excuse me, sir.

169
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,837
There's a large number of you from
the Justice Department here this evening.

170
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,255
Is there any particular reason for that?

171
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:37,337
Just routine.

172
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:38,982
Just routine?
Yes.

173
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:39,953
Any comment, sir?

174
00:10:40,444 --> 00:10:41,749
No. Not right now. Thank you.

175
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,674
Thank you, sir.
Thanks.

176
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:51,130
Hey, that's Colonel Stuart over there.

177
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:53,538
Got a little problem with personnel.

178
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:55,337
Last-minute replacement.

179
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:57,873
How's the security around this place?

180
00:10:58,218 --> 00:10:59,818
Just like we figured.
It's a joke.

181
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,423
Colonel Stuart, could we have
a few words, please?

182
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:03,807
You can have two,

183
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:04,796
fuck and you.

184
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:06,983
No pictures, you pinko bitch.

185
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:10,695
Old news.

186
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:28,851
Excuse me.

187
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:51,545
Hey, man.

188
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:55,326
What is it?

189
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:56,785
You got a key for this door?

190
00:11:57,066 --> 00:11:58,222
Yeah. Why?

191
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,506
Because I want you to open it up.

192
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,642
That's why.

193
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,138
Is there a cop on duty around here?

194
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:07,567
The airport police.

195
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:08,892
Go get them.

196
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:36,116
Hand me the wrench, will ya?

197
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:39,536
Who made you foreman?
Next you're gonna want overtime.

198
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:40,777
Good idea.

199
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:44,563
Ok, hold that end.

200
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,433
Watch it, man.

201
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,345
Alright. Perfect.

202
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:50,755
Perfect.

203
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:52,323
Good to go.

204
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:54,214
Hey!

205
00:12:55,747 --> 00:12:57,071
It's a restricted area.

206
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:58,327
What's the matter?

207
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,970
Couldn't wait for the skycap?
We work here.

208
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,399
Let's see some I.D.

209
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,941
Sure. No problem.
No problem.

210
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:07,882
Take him!

211
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,200
Jesus H. Fuck!

212
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:38,210
What is this, a tag team?

213
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:14,087
You say he came in here
and flashed a badge?

214
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,485
Yeah. He said to bring you guys back here.
Shit.

215
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:45,169
Christ.

216
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,215
Fucker!

217
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:05,933
Freeze!

218
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,058
Nice guess, asshole.

219
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,420
I'm a cop.
That was the bad guy.

220
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:13,207
Where's your I.D.?

221
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:19,770
On its way to Cleveland?

222
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,080
No, you did not explain anything.

223
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:30,804
All you did was shove me back here
into this cattle car.

224
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:33,368
Sir, you were told when you boarded
that we were overbooked.

225
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:34,860
Fine. Done. I accept that.

226
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:37,898
But why in hell can't I get
the first-class meal my network paid for?

227
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:39,418
Do you know who I am?

228
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:41,205
Yes. We've all seen your program.

229
00:16:41,408 --> 00:16:43,142
Your episode Flying Junkyards

230
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:45,629
was a very objective look
at air traffic safety.

231
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:49,349
It wasn't nearly as edifying
as Bimbos of the Sky, was it Connie?

232
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:51,166
You think you're funny.

233
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:52,938
You think you're funny.

234
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:53,900
Fine.

235
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:55,996
I've got your number.

236
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:57,665
And I've got yours.

237
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,458
So park it, sir.

238
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:02,662
Fine.

239
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:13,967
Stewardess.

240
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:15,735
Mr. Thornberg,

241
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:17,707
you cannot monopolize my time.

242
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,373
You cannot put me near that woman.

243
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:20,905
Excuse me?

244
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:25,776
He means he's filed
a restraining order against me.

245
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:28,714
I'm not allowed within 50 feet of him.

246
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,240
Fifty yards.

247
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:34,266
So by keeping me in this section,
you are violating a court order.

248
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,693
I can sue you and this airline.

249
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:39,669
That woman assaulted me,

250
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,939
and she humiliated me in public.

251
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,976
What did you do?

252
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,925
Knocked out two of his teeth.

253
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,869
Would you like some champagne?

254
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:03,664
Sorry, Officer McClane.

255
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:04,808
I had to check.

256
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,477
Here's your piece and shield back.

257
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:08,884
Thanks.

258
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,403
Hey, over here, Officer!

259
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:13,100
We understand that
there was shooting.

260
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,881
The presence of Justice
Department officials.

261
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,601
Jesus! Oh, Christ!

262
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:20,036
Hey, come on. Just a word, ok?

263
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:21,736
What the fuck are you people.

264
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,422
What are you doing here, man?

265
00:18:23,424 --> 00:18:24,460
This is a crime scene.

266
00:18:24,461 --> 00:18:26,194
You got to seal this area off,
for Christ's sake.

267
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:28,408
That's up to the captain.
Oh, it's up to the captain?

268
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,403
Maybe you better take me
up to the captain then?

269
00:18:41,711 --> 00:18:43,296
Where's Cochrane?
He didn't make it.

270
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:44,724
Oh, man.

271
00:18:53,518 --> 00:18:54,586
You're late.

272
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,909
We ran into trouble, Colonel.

273
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,745
Some cop.

274
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:01,507
He killed Cochrane.

275
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:03,807
I barely got away, sir.

276
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:05,245
Did you accomplish your mission?

277
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:07,775
Yes sir but...

278
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,406
Cochrane, sir.

279
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,822
Well, then the damage is minimal.

280
00:19:11,314 --> 00:19:12,920
The penalty could be severe.

281
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:23,050
You fail me again,

282
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,828
and the chamber won't be empty.

283
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:27,502
Dismissed.

284
00:19:44,564 --> 00:19:46,265
Who is it? Come in.

285
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,142
Captain Lorenzo?
Yeah.

286
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,144
I'm John McClane.

287
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:52,782
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are.

288
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:55,365
You're the asshole
that just broke seven F.A.A.

289
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,843
and five District of Columbia regulations,

290
00:19:57,845 --> 00:19:59,944
running around my airport with a gun,

291
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,029
shooting at people.

292
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:02,563
What do you call that shit?

293
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:04,309
Self-defense.

294
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:07,657
Well, what you think that L.A. badge
is gonna get you,

295
00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:09,528
a free lunch or something around here?

296
00:20:10,248 --> 00:20:11,025
No.

297
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,155
Maybe a little professional courtesy.

298
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:15,387
In an airport on Christmas week?

299
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:16,818
You got to be kidding.

300
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:17,993
Ok. Fuck courtesy.

301
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,528
How about just being professional?

302
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,598
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene, Captain.

303
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:25,120
You can't wrap this thing up
in 10 minutes, and you know it.

304
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:27,441
You got to seal the area off,
take pictures, dust for prints.

305
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,361
Hey, don't lecture me, hotshot.

306
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,898
I know what I'm doing.

307
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:32,756
We're gonna dust it down.

308
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:34,321
We'll take all the pictures.

309
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:36,298
We'll sweep for fibers.
When are you gonna do this?

310
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,495
After three or four hundred
more people go through there?

311
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:40,597
You'd be lucky to get a print
from one of your own people.

312
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,396
Just shut down that area and

313
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:44,027
Oh, just shut the area down?

314
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:46,337
It's that simple?
I just shut the area down?

315
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,148
Shit.

316
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,131
And I got everybody from
the Shriners convention,

317
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,662
to the goddamn Boy Scouts
traipsing through here!

318
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:53,941
I got lost kids,

319
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:56,081
lost dogs...
Not now! Later!

320
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,379
I got international diplomats.

321
00:20:58,443 --> 00:21:00,835
I got a fucking reindeer flying in here

322
00:21:00,837 --> 00:21:02,722
from the fucking petting zoo!

323
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:03,378
But,

324
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:05,963
John McClane, he's got a little problem.

325
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,400
Hell, let's shut down
the whole fucking airport!

326
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,986
What do you think they're gonna
say upstairs when I tell them that?

327
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,846
Why don't you pick up
the phone and find out?

328
00:21:12,923 --> 00:21:15,633
Because I don't need
full fucking forensics to tell me

329
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:18,303
all this was, was some punk
stealing luggage!

330
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,146
Luggage?

331
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,563
That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.
You know what that is?

332
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:23,578
It's a porcelain gun made in Germany.

333
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:25,500
It doesn't show up on
your airport x-ray machines,

334
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,364
and it costs more than
you make in a month.

335
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:29,519
You'd be surprised what I make in a month.

336
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:31,661
If it's more than $1.98,

337
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:32,805
I'd be very surprised.
Hey, McClane

338
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:34,645
don't start believing your own press.

339
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:38,595
Yeah, yeah, I know all about
you and that Nakatomi thing in L.A.

340
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:42,183
But just because the TV thinks
you're hot shit, that don't make it so.

341
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,504
Look, you are in my little pond now,

342
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:48,332
and I am the big fish that runs it.

343
00:21:49,447 --> 00:21:52,003
So you capped some lowlife.
Fine.

344
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:55,064
I'll send your fucking captain in L.A.

345
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,413
a fucking commendation!

346
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,761
Now in the meantime, you get
the hell out of my office

347
00:21:58,763 --> 00:22:01,508
before I have you thrown out
of my goddamn airport!

348
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:14,245
Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.

349
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,858
What sets off the metal detectors first?

350
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,804
The lead in your ass
or the shit in your brains?

351
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:21,431
Fat fuck.

352
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,984
Any I.D. on this guy?

353
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,113
That's somebody else's problem.
Wait here.

354
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,991
Ok, your car's ready.

355
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:40,433
If you'd just sign right here
Hi.

356
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,786
Hi.
I need to borrow this and this.

357
00:22:42,788 --> 00:22:44,662
I'll bring it right back.
Hey!

358
00:22:46,215 --> 00:22:47,382
Hey! Yo! Hold up!

359
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:49,416
Yo!

360
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:53,247
Hold up, boys.

361
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:54,463
Hold up. Hold up.

362
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:55,568
We got to check something.
What are you doing?

363
00:22:56,162 --> 00:22:57,625
Pretty gruesome fucking job.

364
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,594
In all the confusion in there,

365
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:01,958
we forgot to get this clown's prints.

366
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:03,129
Believe that?

367
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:07,639
Christ.

368
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:09,385
Hey, you're supposed
to do that at the morgue.

369
00:23:09,412 --> 00:23:10,313
Not anymore.

370
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:12,998
Got a new S.O.P.
for D.O.A.'s from the F.A.A.

371
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:18,912
I don't think this one's
gonna make it, boys.

372
00:23:19,036 --> 00:23:20,035
Thanks a lot.

373
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,963
Powell here.

374
00:25:14,988 --> 00:25:17,760
Take that Twinkie out of your
mouth and grab a pencil, will ya?

375
00:25:19,075 --> 00:25:20,343
Hey, John.
How you doing?

376
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:21,903
Holly stood me up a day,

377
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:24,134
and I'm here alone in D.C.

378
00:25:24,135 --> 00:25:25,028
<i>with my in-laws.</i>

379
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,314
The old in-laws?

380
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:30,468
Man, they do love their policemen
son-in-laws, don't they?

381
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:32,082
Listen, Al, what is the...

382
00:25:32,273 --> 00:25:34,852
<i>fax machine telephone number
there at the station?</i>

383
00:25:37,158 --> 00:25:37,932
Let's see.

384
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:41,020
555-3212.

385
00:25:41,338 --> 00:25:44,054
3212.
Hold on a second, alright?

386
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:45,924
I wanna send you something here.

387
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:46,974
Excuse me.

388
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,456
<i>You and faxes?</i>

389
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:50,144
<i>This is a first.</i>

390
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:53,490
Yeah, well, Holly told me I should
wake up and smell the '90s.

391
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:54,566
This way?

392
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:56,048
No. That way.

393
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,593
Wait. It's upside down.

394
00:25:57,594 --> 00:25:58,872
It doesn't matter.

395
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:00,272
Ok. Here it comes.

396
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,912
I'm sending you something right now.

397
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:06,856
Hold on a second, cowboy.

398
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:23,338
Fingerprints?

399
00:26:23,689 --> 00:26:25,268
<i>Got an unidentified stiff here.</i>

400
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,085
I've circled the whorls in pen

401
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:28,910
in case the transmission is a little fuzzy.

402
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:30,263
Listen, run it through state and federal,

403
00:26:30,265 --> 00:26:31,598
and if you can run it through Interpol.

404
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:32,639
Will do.

405
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,017
Well, what's this about?

406
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:35,696
Just a feeling I have.

407
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,859
When you get those feelings,
insurance companies start to go bankrupt.

408
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:42,804
Listen, the fax number is...

409
00:26:42,957 --> 00:26:44,155
ls on the top edge

410
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:45,656
of the transmission he just got.
Is on the top edge

411
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:47,293
of the transmission you just got.

412
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:51,780
Oh, an airport?

413
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,979
Listen, you're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

414
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:58,458
Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.

415
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:07,038
Just as this storm starts breaking,

416
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:10,002
the satellite feed up
and drops the other shoe on us.

417
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,395
Look at this new front moving in.

418
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,557
Makes its baby brother
look like chickenshit.

419
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:19,083
Well, I can sand down
all the runways and...

420
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,772
keep the plows going between landings,

421
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,032
but you got to downshift them up there,
give me time to work.

422
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:24,571
You got it.

423
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:27,115
Alright, everyone.

424
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:30,156
Let's call all our birds
and slow them down

425
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:31,958
before we get a parking lot
over our heads.

426
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,517
The line starts at the Mississippi
and they better start taking numbers.

427
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,856
Can I get you another?

428
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,831
No, thank you.

429
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:55,442
I only have to look at his face
for another 15 or 20 minutes.

430
00:27:57,685 --> 00:27:59,644
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.</i>

431
00:27:59,913 --> 00:28:02,543
I've just been informed
by Dulles Traffic Control,

432
00:28:02,629 --> 00:28:04,690
that there is a weather front
moving in ahead of us.

433
00:28:05,537 --> 00:28:07,912
We may be up here
a little while longer.

434
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:09,423
Thank you.

435
00:28:10,382 --> 00:28:11,214
On second thought.

436
00:28:19,138 --> 00:28:19,867
Al?

437
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,374
Hey, I'm right here, partner.

438
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:24,858
Your stiff's dossier
is coming through right now.

439
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,419
<i>What can you tell me about him?</i>

440
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:29,527
He's dead.

441
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,529
You needed a computer
to figure that one out?

442
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:33,542
No, no, no, no.
You don't follow me.

443
00:28:34,186 --> 00:28:37,676
According to the Department of Defense,
he's been dead for two years.

444
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:38,799
What?

445
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:42,062
<i>That's right. Sergeant
Oswald Cochrane.</i>

446
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,281
American adviser in Honduras.

447
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,533
Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.

448
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:48,724
Officer?

449
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:53,960
<i>Read between the lines, and I'd say
it looks like a lot of black-bag stuff to me.</i>

450
00:28:54,189 --> 00:28:56,774
Yeah, I see it.
Alright, Al. Thanks a lot.

451
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:58,084
Hey, anytime.

452
00:28:58,772 --> 00:28:59,501
Ok.

453
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,127
Say, I close in about an hour.

454
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:05,209
Maybe we can go get a drink?

455
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:09,029
Just the fax, ma'am.

456
00:29:09,529 --> 00:29:10,636
Just the fax.

457
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,420
Hey, wait a second.
I see somebody.

458
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,991
I'll call you back, ok?
Hold on. Hold on.

459
00:29:25,362 --> 00:29:26,773
The Ghost of Christmas Past.

460
00:29:26,857 --> 00:29:28,305
Nakatomi? L.A.?

461
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:29,597
You're John McClane, right?

462
00:29:29,737 --> 00:29:30,654
Who are you?

463
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:32,410
Sam Coleman. WNTW News.

464
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:34,785
Excuse me.
Hey, come on.

465
00:29:34,787 --> 00:29:36,871
Give me a break.
I saw the stiff.

466
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,782
Word is, that was your handiwork.

467
00:29:39,092 --> 00:29:39,730
No.

468
00:29:40,168 --> 00:29:41,573
I only do needle-point.

469
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:47,895
Great.

470
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,763
National just shut down.

471
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,004
Totally iced.

472
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:52,725
They're gonna be sending us
their planes.

473
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:54,152
Happy, happy holidays.

474
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:56,332
The worst part, Mr. Trudeau,
was the press.

475
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,509
They were here anyways, crawling
all over the Esperanza story,

476
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:01,153
so they got it right on the fucking news.

477
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,586
You know, bloodstains and all.

478
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,155
Personally, I'd like to lock every
damn reporter out of the airport,

479
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,048
but then they'd just pull
that freedom-of-speech crap on us.

480
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,182
Then the A.C.L.U. would be all over us.

481
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:12,908
Murder on television.

482
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:14,974
Hell of a start for Christmas week.

483
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:18,796
What is it?
A gang thing like last time?

484
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:21,429
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

485
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,081
Who the hell is this?
John McClane.

486
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,429
I'm a police officer.
In an unauthorized area.

487
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,803
L.A., Mr. Trudeau, don't mean shit.

488
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,023
Yeah? That's what I said about
my last cholesterol test.

489
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,389
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

490
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:40,346
I'm sure Captain Lorenzo
has explained to you,

491
00:30:40,348 --> 00:30:42,725
the minor little fracas
with the minor little thieves.

492
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:44,559
Maybe he can explain this.

493
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:05,242
<i>All systems tapped, Colonel.</i>

494
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:06,772
Fire it up.

495
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:23,508
H minus five minutes.

496
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:24,952
Stand by.

497
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:27,489
Alright.

498
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:30,530
We've got a body in the morgue
that seems to have died twice.

499
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:32,521
Assuming it's not a computer error,

500
00:31:32,522 --> 00:31:33,481
what do we assume?

501
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:35,692
That somebody's about
to seriously fuck with this airport.

502
00:31:35,715 --> 00:31:37,364
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

503
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:39,597
I mean, I know
we're dummies up here, McClane

504
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,767
so give us a taste of your brilliant genius.

505
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:44,204
I mean, you're talking about a hijacking,
a robbery or what?

506
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,019
Look, I'm not sure

507
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:46,517
Oh, he's not sure.

508
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,870
Well, I'm stunned.

509
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:49,241
I got to lie down.

510
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,462
The only people that go to this
much trouble are professionals.

511
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:53,333
Not luggage thieves and not punks.

512
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:54,286
Professional at what?

513
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,309
What the fuck do you think this is?

514
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,690
The safety patrol here?

515
00:31:57,777 --> 00:32:00,295
This is the résumé
of a professional mercenary.

516
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:02,126
You got the world's biggest
drug dealer on his way here,

517
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:03,898
now what you need, a slide
rule to figure this out?

518
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:06,807
Or maybe another body in a zipper bag
before you start asking questions?

519
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:09,797
Hey pal, you're the one that gave us
that fucking body, remember that.

520
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,854
Yeah, I remember that.

521
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:19,880
Lorenzo,

522
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:22,027
have all your shift
commanders report in.

523
00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:22,650
Now.

524
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,201
What? You're not buying into this?

525
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:26,468
I want them to report
anything out of the ordinary,

526
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,024
no matter how trivial.
You got that?

527
00:32:28,131 --> 00:32:29,188
Yeah, I got it.

528
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:30,597
Oh, my God!

529
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,786
What?

530
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:33,473
The runways. Look.
Son of a bitch!

531
00:32:33,669 --> 00:32:35,904
What the hell?
They're shutting down.

532
00:32:36,445 --> 00:32:37,781
Jesus Christ.

533
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:45,654
Go to emergency lighting, now.

534
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,141
Emergency.
We are in a code yellow.

535
00:32:49,608 --> 00:32:51,167
Backup systems won't come up.

536
00:32:51,211 --> 00:32:52,269
Shunt to another terminal.

537
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:54,605
Bobby, what do you got?
<i>Nothing. The whole network is down.</i>

538
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:55,955
The whole network is down.

539
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,620
Maybe we should call the power company?

540
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,735
We're on the same goddamn grid,
and we're hot.

541
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,438
<i>Dulles, what's going on?
I'm on approach.</i>

542
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,323
Maintain position. Repeat.

543
00:33:03,324 --> 00:33:04,805
<i>What's going on down there?</i>

544
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:06,357
Roger. We're on it. We're on it.

545
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,042
Western, we're unable right now.
Please delay.

546
00:33:08,044 --> 00:33:09,487
Fuji 604,

547
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,345
execute published missed
approach procedure and hold.

548
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,668
T.W.A. 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

549
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,880
Climb to and maintain
one zero thousand.

550
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:20,041
I've checked all systems.
It ain't happening!

551
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:35,556
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,683
What's it look like?

553
00:33:37,858 --> 00:33:39,175
Approach control it's gone.

554
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:40,334
Jesus.

555
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:42,010
Instrument landing system is down.

556
00:33:43,832 --> 00:33:45,886
Confirmed. I.L.S. is dead.

557
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:48,006
Every goddamn system's dead,

558
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:49,827
and NMAC monitors are down.

559
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:57,412
<i>Attention all controllers. Attention.</i>

560
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:59,021
<i>We have a code-red alert.</i>

561
00:33:59,568 --> 00:34:01,716
<i>Every aircraft approaching our sector</i>

562
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:04,184
<i>who are not already
in our landing pattern</i>

563
00:34:04,186 --> 00:34:06,422
<i>gets diverted to their
alternate airport now.</i>

564
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,026
<i>Everyone already on approach</i>

565
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:11,113
<i>or inside our pattern</i>

566
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:12,965
<i>holds at the outer markers.</i>

567
00:34:13,962 --> 00:34:15,691
<i>Stack them, pack them
and rack them.</i>

568
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:17,167
<i>Move.</i>

569
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:18,938
Get someone on it!

570
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,105
Alright. Not a word
of this leaves this room.

571
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:28,156
There must be 15,000 people
in this airport,

572
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:29,821
and we don't need panic on our hands.

573
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,797
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

574
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:36,396
After that, those planes low on fuel
aren't gonna be circling.

575
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,983
They're gonna be dropping
on the White House lawn.

576
00:34:41,794 --> 00:34:42,831
McClane,

577
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:44,547
this what you expected?

578
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,192
No.

579
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:50,208
This is just the beginning.

580
00:34:54,476 --> 00:34:56,131
F.A.A. hotline.

581
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:57,603
How could they know already?

582
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:58,963
They can't.

583
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:03,096
Maybe it's the boys
that pulled all your plugs.

584
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:04,902
Put it on speaker.

585
00:35:06,488 --> 00:35:08,205
<i>Attention, Dulles Tower.</i>

586
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,232
<i>Attention.</i>

587
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:10,697
<i>They say that blind men</i>

588
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:12,880
become very attentive
by way of compensation.

589
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:14,763
Now that you're both blind and deaf.

590
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:16,882
I think I've got your attention.

591
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,355
I'm aware your recorders are active,

592
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:21,253
so I'll be quick.

593
00:35:21,448 --> 00:35:23,532
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

594
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:25,285
How did you get on this line?

595
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:26,173
Who is this?

596
00:35:27,149 --> 00:35:28,946
Who I am is unimportant.

597
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:30,430
What I want...

598
00:35:31,608 --> 00:35:32,964
Well, if you don't want those planes

599
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,481
to start splashing into the Potomac
as they run out of fuel,

600
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:37,248
what I want is very important.

601
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,780
<i>A plane will be landing
at this airport in 58 minutes.</i>

602
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:44,051
It is FM-1, Foreign Military One.

603
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:45,946
<i>Now, I'm sure you gentlemen</i>

604
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:47,147
<i>are well aware of the unique</i>

605
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:48,237
<i>nature of this flight,</i>
Esperanza?

606
00:35:48,677 --> 00:35:50,450
<i>And the importance of its cargo.</i>

607
00:35:51,487 --> 00:35:54,007
This plane will not be met by anyone.

608
00:35:55,411 --> 00:35:57,725
It will land on a runway of my designation,

609
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,576
where it will remain isolated
and unapproached.

610
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:04,825
That will conclude my interest
in this aircraft and your responsibility for it.

611
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:06,839
At the same time,

612
00:36:07,314 --> 00:36:09,885
I want a 747 cargo conversion,

613
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:11,338
fully fueled,

614
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:13,572
<i>and placed at my disposal.</i>

615
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,889
<i>You have two more minutes to advise</i>

616
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:18,454
<i>your inbound aircraft
to hold at their outer radio marker.</i>

617
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:21,185
<i>After that, you will be able
to receive only.</i>

618
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:24,822
<i>Any attempt to restore
your systems will be met</i>

619
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:26,438
by severe penalties.

620
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,867
He's bluffing.

621
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:30,404
Damn it, you can't do this.

622
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:32,573
I am doing this.

623
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:43,167
Ok, you guys, listen up.
I need you to punch up a code 15.

624
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:44,826
I got an idea, and I need your help.

625
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:48,102
If Esperanza gets on that plane
and makes it to a country,

626
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:49,797
that has no extradition treaties,
we're fucked.

627
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,858
They're talking to us on
our own goddamn system.

628
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,927
They got to be close.

629
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:55,012
I'll have my men tear this airport apart.

630
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,714
Just in the nick of time?

631
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,867
Hey McClane,
I got a first-class unit here,

632
00:36:58,869 --> 00:36:59,933
SWAT team and all.

633
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:02,016
We don't need any
Monday-morning quarterbacks.

634
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:02,741
Fuck Monday morning.

635
00:37:02,743 --> 00:37:04,238
My wife's on one of the goddamn planes

636
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,277
these guys are fucking with.

637
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:06,818
That puts me on the playing field.

638
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:08,217
And if you'd have moved your fat ass,

639
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:10,653
when I told you to we would
not be hip deep in shit right now.

640
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,663
That's it. Security. You're out of here.
Mr. Trudeau!

641
00:37:12,676 --> 00:37:15,803
Mr. Trudeau, do I have to remind you
about F.A.A. regulations,

642
00:37:15,805 --> 00:37:18,575
regarding unauthorized personnel
in the control tower?

643
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:20,806
All we have to do is find
a way to transmit.

644
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:21,643
Yeah, right.

645
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:23,643
Somebody wanna run down
to Radio Shack and get a transmitter?

646
00:37:23,645 --> 00:37:24,764
We already have one.

647
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:27,614
The new terminal wing they're
building 20 airlines when it's done,

648
00:37:27,615 --> 00:37:29,531
all with their own
reservation computers,

649
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:31,578
all tied in to a nice big antenna array.

650
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,856
Alright, better see Mr. McClane out.

651
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:34,190
Take him out of here
Get your fucking hands off me!

652
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,616
You got no business being up here.

653
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:36,386
I'm telling you guys.

654
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,240
Everything we need is over
by the annex sky-walk,

655
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:39,076
just sitting there,

656
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:40,979
waiting to go on line.
The annex sky-walk?

657
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:43,485
Goddamn it, Trudeau.
You're dealing with pros here.

658
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:46,067
You can't fuck with these people!
Listen to me!

659
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:47,544
Sam Coleman, WNTW news.

660
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:49,983
Mr. Trudeau, there are a lot of
rumors flying around here today.

661
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:51,466
No way. No way, lady.

662
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,646
Hell, no. No. You...

663
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,696
This is off limits, Coleman.
You know that.

664
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:56,376
Get them out of here.
Out of here.

665
00:37:56,378 --> 00:37:58,595
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of too!

666
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,485
What's the hell!
Get your fucking hands off me.

667
00:38:00,502 --> 00:38:02,754
For shit's sake,
just get them both out of here!

668
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:06,077
Lobby Security, come in.

669
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:08,797
Tomlinson here.
<i>This is Captain Lorenzo here,</i>

670
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:11,391
with two unauthorized personnel
in the fucking tower.

671
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:13,215
Now, would you get your
thumb out of your ass,

672
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:14,358
<i>get them out of the elevator</i>

673
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,100
<i>or you're gonna find a goddamn
pink slip in your Christmas stocking.</i>

674
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:18,629
10-4.
Let's go.

675
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:21,462
Goddamn!

676
00:38:22,496 --> 00:38:24,748
Anything who can think of?
Can't fuck with what guy?

677
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,401
Shit. Hang on over there.

678
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:27,777
What for?
Just hang on.

679
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:31,699
Big drug dealer on his way to prison,

680
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:33,198
gunfight at airport,

681
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:35,987
every controller in the coffee shop
getting beeped and hauling ass

682
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:37,152
and you rocking the boat.

683
00:38:37,434 --> 00:38:39,927
Connection? Come on, McClane.
Just a few words.

684
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:41,850
Ok, just a few words.
Fuck off.

685
00:38:42,457 --> 00:38:44,863
Thanks, but I already
got that from Colonel Stuart.

686
00:38:46,916 --> 00:38:47,758
Stuart?

687
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:50,724
The guy that got canned by Congress.
That's who he was.

688
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:53,001
Who he who?
What? Hey just...

689
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:55,592
It's ok.
I've done this before.

690
00:39:06,895 --> 00:39:08,222
Hey.
Hi.

691
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:11,348
Where's the other one?
Claustrophobic, I guess.

692
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,112
It's a VHF system, but the planes
are so close it doesn't matter.

693
00:39:17,197 --> 00:39:19,278
I can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,

694
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:21,011
wire in a crossover, and we're hot.

695
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:23,016
Even the planes would not
know the difference.

696
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,298
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

697
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:27,609
I want my SWAT team
to go with him as cover.

698
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:30,339
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of too.

699
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,478
Oh, man.
I can't fucking believe this.

700
00:39:39,017 --> 00:39:40,792
Another basement.
Another elevator.

701
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:44,380
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

702
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:44,114
Who are you?

703
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:47,346
I'm Marvin.

704
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:49,746
Marvin. Marv... I'm...
I'm Marvin.

705
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:52,499
I thought you was trying
to steal my records, that's all.

706
00:40:53,214 --> 00:40:54,654
I'm just the janitor.

707
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:06,025
This is Dulles Approach
to all aircraft holding at Potomac VORTAC.

708
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,915
<i>We are experiencing
some technical problems here.</i>

709
00:41:08,957 --> 00:41:11,659
<i>The weather conditions,
which have been deteriorating all day,</i>

710
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:13,755
<i>have now been complicated by,</i>

711
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:15,480
<i>by an unforeseen human factor.</i>

712
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:19,430
<i>This has affected all
of our electronic equipment,</i>

713
00:41:19,454 --> 00:41:21,387
<i>and their redundant backups as well.</i>

714
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:25,273
<i>As a result, our nav
and approach systems are down and...</i>

715
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:27,638
<i>we expect to lose voice
in another minute.</i>

716
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:32,165
<i>We want you to continue holding
at the outer marker as directed</i>

717
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,137
<i>and wait for further instructions.</i>

718
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:36,627
<i>As soon as we're back on line we'll</i>

719
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:39,570
<i>expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.</i>

720
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:42,536
Good luck.

721
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,254
God bless.

722
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,041
Alright. Change the boards.

723
00:42:22,048 --> 00:42:23,395
Ok, stand back.

724
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,988
The sky-walk annex.
No, goddamn it. The annex sky-walk.

725
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,466
Listen to me. The annex sky-walk.

726
00:42:28,468 --> 00:42:30,122
It's the last thing I heard before
they kicked me out there.

727
00:42:30,595 --> 00:42:32,224
Well, let me see here now.

728
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:34,921
Well, this must be it right there.
See?

729
00:42:35,871 --> 00:42:39,058
That's the raised platform,
and there is the new terminal.

730
00:42:39,232 --> 00:42:40,514
There's your sky-walk.

731
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:42,510
Goddamn bottleneck.

732
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:44,318
Nice place for an ambush.

733
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:48,782
What's the fastest way you can
get me out to that spot?

734
00:42:52,123 --> 00:42:54,422
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

735
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,782
Don't worry, Mr. Barnes.
We'll watch your back.

736
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,047
Yeah? Who watches yours?

737
00:43:10,642 --> 00:43:12,221
Main ventilation duct.

738
00:43:12,812 --> 00:43:14,449
Main ventilation duct.

739
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:16,928
And bingo.

740
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,276
Just once.

741
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,582
I'd like a regular, normal Christmas.

742
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:24,825
Eggnog,

743
00:43:26,048 --> 00:43:27,342
a fucking Christmas tree

744
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:29,924
a little turkey.

745
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:32,511
But no,

746
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,903
I got to crawl around in
this motherfucking tin can.

747
00:43:41,057 --> 00:43:43,496
We're in the annex sky-walk.
I can see the array.

748
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:46,679
I'll give you a call for a protocol test
as soon as it's hot.

749
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,082
That's all for now.

750
00:43:48,481 --> 00:43:50,525
Sergeant, we may need
some more equipment.

751
00:43:50,612 --> 00:43:52,580
I'd like to send one
of your guys back for it.

752
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:54,048
Right, sir. You got it.

753
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:57,990
What the hell?

754
00:43:57,991 --> 00:43:59,386
What the hell's going on?

755
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:00,229
Hey!

756
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,557
Put that back on!

757
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:06,402
Hey asshole,
what do I look like to you?

758
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:08,543
A sitting duck.

759
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:11,400
Take him!

760
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,341
Shit!

761
00:44:16,746 --> 00:44:17,523
Damn it.

762
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:18,814
I hate it when I'm right.

763
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,205
Look out!
Get down!

764
00:44:33,554 --> 00:44:35,351
Keep your head down!

765
00:44:46,123 --> 00:44:47,322
You son of a bitch!

766
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:06,913
Stay down!

767
00:46:21,503 --> 00:46:22,142
Fuck!

768
00:46:23,582 --> 00:46:24,613
Motherfucker!

769
00:46:32,124 --> 00:46:32,881
Come on.

770
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:55,796
Fucking son of a bitch!

771
00:47:12,755 --> 00:47:13,637
Shit.

772
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:19,994
Fuck.

773
00:47:24,517 --> 00:47:26,696
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

774
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,660
Geez.

775
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:03,405
You alright?

776
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,215
Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:07,781
But the antenna array,
I got to get to it and set it up.

778
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:13,802
Get down!

779
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,599
Goddamn.

780
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:38,223
Bait.

781
00:48:40,949 --> 00:48:42,143
Jerk us off

782
00:48:43,893 --> 00:48:45,966
make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.

783
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:51,854
Make you waste your time,

784
00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:57,251
time we don't have.

785
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:13,825
I think you're closer than 50 yards.

786
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:15,820
So's that airplane.

787
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:17,384
Practically.

788
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:18,328
Yeah.

789
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,047
There's quite a few of them out there.

790
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:21,755
It looks like a regular traffic jam.

791
00:49:22,051 --> 00:49:23,581
There's nothing regular about it.

792
00:49:24,846 --> 00:49:26,223
See? You're intrigued.

793
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:28,431
That's my gift, Mrs. McClane.

794
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:29,743
I notice things,

795
00:49:29,744 --> 00:49:31,490
things other people would not see.

796
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:34,211
That's how I make people curious.

797
00:49:34,757 --> 00:49:36,398
Don't you mean nauseous?

798
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:40,338
Look. The people have a right to know
everything about everybody.

799
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:42,821
You got in the way of that.

800
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:44,068
Listen buster,

801
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:45,490
you endangered my children,

802
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:48,288
and you didn't do it for anything
as noble as the people.

803
00:49:49,338 --> 00:49:51,093
The only time you even see the people

804
00:49:51,095 --> 00:49:53,455
is when you look down to see
what it is you're stepping.

805
00:49:58,564 --> 00:50:00,648
Me? Yeah, I'll live

806
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,683
but Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead,

807
00:50:03,081 --> 00:50:05,287
and the antenna array is gone.

808
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:07,100
Didn't you see it?

809
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:10,784
I'm tired of looking for a new miracle.

810
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:16,006
Just hold a minute.
No, I'll be right back.

811
00:50:16,008 --> 00:50:18,215
Just hold for a second.
Something's going on here.

812
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:20,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just hold on for a minute.

813
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:23,354
I say again, Annex Team,
give us a sit rep.

814
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:27,325
Annex Team, come in.
Do you copy?

815
00:50:29,535 --> 00:50:31,192
It's got some kind of scramble on it.

816
00:50:31,742 --> 00:50:33,230
Can you do anything with it?

817
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:35,459
No.

818
00:50:35,772 --> 00:50:38,235
This scramble mode must
activate on this code panel.

819
00:50:38,606 --> 00:50:41,151
Even if we scan their frequency,
we can't listen in.

820
00:50:41,784 --> 00:50:44,139
These guys are pros.
So you break the code.

821
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:45,990
I wanna hear what these bastards
are saying to each other.

822
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:47,727
This is a 10-digit control panel,

823
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:49,110
six-digit readout.

824
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:51,523
Hell, that could be
a million combinations.

825
00:50:52,063 --> 00:50:53,831
Next time you kill one of these guys,

826
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,881
get him to enter the code first.

827
00:50:58,754 --> 00:50:59,375
Sir,

828
00:50:59,749 --> 00:51:01,635
we just monitored a call
from their chief engineer.

829
00:51:01,904 --> 00:51:04,051
Our people took out
their SWAT team completely.

830
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:06,141
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

831
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:07,222
We're right on schedule.

832
00:51:07,224 --> 00:51:09,620
Losing our own team
wasn't part of the plan.

833
00:51:16,497 --> 00:51:17,879
Attention, Dulles Tower.

834
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:20,021
<i>Attention, Dulles Control Tower.</i>

835
00:51:20,352 --> 00:51:22,110
<i>Mr. Trudeau, I know you're listening.</i>

836
00:51:22,638 --> 00:51:24,407
<i>Unfortunately, you're not obeying.</i>

837
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,502
Try me face-to-face, and we'll see.

838
00:51:26,504 --> 00:51:28,644
You were warned not to try
to restore your systems.

839
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:32,479
<i>You've wasted lives and precious time
on a futile and obvious target.</i>

840
00:51:33,307 --> 00:51:35,152
Now you're gonna pay the penalty.

841
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,700
I got five dead officers down here,
Colonel Stuart.

842
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:39,083
<i>Isn't that penalty enough?</i>

843
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:42,357
McClane, you keep out of this.
You've been nothing but a pain...

844
00:51:44,654 --> 00:51:45,881
<i>Oh, McClane.</i>

845
00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:48,327
John McClane.

846
00:51:49,257 --> 00:51:52,346
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

847
00:51:53,381 --> 00:51:55,140
<i>I read about you in People magazine.</i>

848
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:57,572
<i>You seemed out of your league
on Night-line, I thought.</i>

849
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,262
Hey, Colonel, blow me.

850
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,525
How much drug money
is Esperanza paying you to turn traitor?

851
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,403
I think Cardinal Richelieu said it best.

852
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:07,702
Treason is merely a matter of dates.

853
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:11,302
<i>This country's got to learn
that it can't keep cutting the legs off</i>

854
00:52:11,304 --> 00:52:13,014
of men like General Esperanza,

855
00:52:13,268 --> 00:52:16,640
men who have the guts to stand up
against communist aggression.

856
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:20,452
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

857
00:52:20,563 --> 00:52:22,556
<i>What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?</i>

858
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:27,258
No. I think we can find
something in between.

859
00:52:30,131 --> 00:52:31,212
Watch this.

860
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:35,132
Give me a flight number,
one that's low on fuel.

861
00:52:37,162 --> 00:52:39,241
Windsor 114.
Transatlantic from London.

862
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,827
Fuel tank's dry as a martini.

863
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:44,272
Activate the I.L.S. landing system,

864
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:45,920
but recalibrate sea level

865
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:49,278
minus 200 feet.

866
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:14,944
Oh, Jesus!

867
00:53:15,424 --> 00:53:17,734
They've reset ground level minus 200 feet.

868
00:53:18,433 --> 00:53:20,312
<i>Windsor Flight 114.</i>

869
00:53:20,314 --> 00:53:21,817
<i>This is Dulles Approach.</i>

870
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:22,806
<i>Do you copy?</i>

871
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:26,046
<i>Dulles Approach, this is Windsor 114.</i>

872

<i>Where the devil have you been?</i>

873
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,559
<i>Windsor 114. Dulles Approach.</i>

874

<i>We've been right here
all along, old buddy.</i>

875
00:53:31,988 --> 00:53:34,812
<i>Our systems only came back
on line just this very second.</i>

876
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:39,328
Windsor 114 you are cleared
for I.L.S. approach,

877
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:41,174
<i>runway two-niner.</i>

878
00:53:41,562 --> 00:53:43,866
<i>Contact Dulles Tower frequency
at the outer marker.</i>

879
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:45,897
Jesus Christ!
He's gonna crash the fucking plane!

880
00:53:45,945 --> 00:53:47,818
<i>Roger, approach and about time.</i>

881
00:53:47,846 --> 00:53:50,783
I've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.

882
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:53,493
<i>Roger, 114. Understand.</i>

883
00:53:53,494 --> 00:53:55,056
<i>Calibrate Dulles altimeter</i>
Oh, Jesus.

884
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:56,942
<i>Setting 2-9</i>
They'll fly right into the concrete.

885
00:53:56,944 --> 00:53:58,473
<i>9-2.</i>
Son of a bitch!

886
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,466
Why are they listening to him?

887
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:02,205
It's our frequency why should not they?

888
00:54:02,388 --> 00:54:04,013
<i>Dulles, this is Windsor 114.</i>

889
00:54:04,464 --> 00:54:05,236
Barnes!

890
00:54:05,238 --> 00:54:07,827
<i>This is Dulles Tower.
We have radar contact.</i>

891
00:54:09,353 --> 00:54:10,434
Give me your coat!

892
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:13,203
What are you gonna do?

893
00:54:15,363 --> 00:54:16,519
Whatever I can.

894
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:20,956
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

895
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,099
as you've probably noticed
we've started our descent.

896
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:25,143
<i>We're sorry for the inconvenience</i>

897
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:27,115
<i>but we'll all be on the ground
in a few minutes.</i>

898
00:54:27,506 --> 00:54:28,810
Thank you.
Please keep your seat belts on.

899
00:54:30,693 --> 00:54:32,780
Oh, not to worry, we've made
arrangements for your next flight,

900
00:54:32,782 --> 00:54:34,236
so you won't miss it, ok?
Thank you.

901
00:54:35,217 --> 00:54:37,543
In your seat, please.
Come on. In your seat.

902
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:40,276
Oh, hey.

903
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:42,248
We're just like British Rail, love.

904
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:44,029
We may be late, but we get you there.

905
00:54:44,805 --> 00:54:45,799
Don't worry.

906
00:55:02,808 --> 00:55:04,151
Good luck, McClane!

907
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:29,525
<i>Dulles, this is Windsor 114,</i>

00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:34,203
This is Dulles Tower.

We have radar contact

912
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:38,513
You're in the glide path,
and you're looking good.

913
00:55:48,624 --> 00:55:50,024
There's somebody out there!

914
00:55:55,068 --> 00:55:56,093
It's McClane.

915
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,928
Christ.

916
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:03,550
Approach flaps.

917

Approach flaps.

Altitude 1,000 feet.

922
00:56:13,796 --> 00:56:15,750
800, guys!
You're only at 800 feet!

923
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,283
<i>Fire and Rescue,

Looking good, Windsor.

928
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:27,834
Now watch it.

929
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:30,078
30-knot crosswinds
and the runway is icy.

930
00:56:31,026 --> 00:56:32,585
Attaboy. We've got you.

931
00:56:34,316 --> 00:56:35,537
We've got you.

932
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:48,934
No!

933
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:50,102
Pull up!

934
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,135
Jesus!

935
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:08,416
<i>We're gonna die!</i>
We've got you.

936
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:34,143
No.

937
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:36,913
God.

938
00:57:42,176 --> 00:57:43,403
Motherfucker.

939
00:57:47,098 --> 00:57:48,022
Motherfucker.

940
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:07,520
That concludes our object lesson
for this evening.

941
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:11,099
If the 747 we requested
is ready on time

942
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:13,688
and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested

943
00:58:14,441 --> 00:58:15,885
further lessons can be avoided.

944
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:17,300
Out.

945
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:20,013
God.

946
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:43,483
Come on, you guys!

947
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:51,873
Hurry! Hurry!

948
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,563
We need a truck over there!

949
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:08,035
We got no sign of survivors down here!
It's a goddamn nightmare!

950
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,682
Barnes!

951
00:59:24,882 --> 00:59:28,614
We've got to warn those planes there is a lunatic
down here who likes to pretend he's the tower.

952
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,300
Get up to the cabin.
Get me on the air.

953
00:59:30,325 --> 00:59:31,225
How?

954
00:59:31,227 --> 00:59:32,513
You figure it out!

955
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:34,539
Here's the manifest.

956
00:59:55,183 --> 00:59:56,890
McClane, I know how you must feel.

957
01:00:02,578 --> 01:00:04,334
I wanted to help those people tonight.

958
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,363
I was pretty goddamn useless.

959
01:00:12,851 --> 01:00:14,603
We called the government for help.

960
01:00:14,605 --> 01:00:15,333
They're...

961
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:17,731
gonna send in a special army unit

962
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,811
a counter-terrorist team.

963
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,994
Your wife's plane?

964
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:34,016
Well, they're still broadcasting
even though we can't answer.

965
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,458
They're gonna run out
of fuel in 90 minutes.

966
01:00:51,956 --> 01:00:52,874
Listen, Dick.

967
01:00:53,409 --> 01:00:54,817
That is your name...

968
01:00:55,244 --> 01:00:55,826
Dick.

969
01:00:56,979 --> 01:00:58,871
If you're going to continue
to get this close,

970
01:00:58,873 --> 01:01:01,647
do you think you might consider
switching aftershaves?

971
01:01:02,933 --> 01:01:04,125
Anything else?

972
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:07,323
Stronger mouth wash might be nice.

973
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:12,143
Well Colonel,

974
01:01:12,144 --> 01:01:13,872
they've done everything
we've anticipated...

975
01:01:14,682 --> 01:01:15,595
so far.

976
01:01:15,597 --> 01:01:18,386
<i>But still there has been
no official word from authorities.</i>

977
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:22,833
<i>Meanwhile, despite the fact that only one
runway has been closed due to the tragedy,</i>

978
01:01:23,131 --> 01:01:26,000
<i>several dozen airliners are
visible from where I stand,</i>

979
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:27,551
<i>endlessly circling the field.</i>

980
01:01:27,878 --> 01:01:31,033
<i>Other reports say that there was
trouble in the tower before the crash</i>

981
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,322
<i>and that that may have
even contributed to it.</i>

982
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:34,826
<i>One thing is certain,</i>

983
01:01:34,827 --> 01:01:36,233
<i>with weather
conditions worsening</i>

984
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,260
<i>the problem here and in the sky above us
will continue to grow.</i>

985
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,870
<i>I'm Samantha Coleman</i>

986
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:42,608
<i>at Dulles International Airport.</i>

987
01:01:50,257 --> 01:01:51,744
Victor. Victor. Victor.

988
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:53,240
Yeah, what's up?

989
01:01:53,326 --> 01:01:54,926
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot

990
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:56,056
or did you put them in your carry-on?

991
01:01:56,057 --> 01:01:57,246
Are you crazy?

992
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,520
I would not let those assholes check them in.
I love you.

993
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,660
Give me one of the receivers.

994
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:08,421
Can you tune in to the cockpit frequency?

995
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,741
Yeah. Why?

996
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:12,606
I wanna hear what's going on.

997
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,139
Should be right here on our band.

998
01:02:19,009 --> 01:02:19,674
Nothing.

999
01:02:19,676 --> 01:02:21,590
You just told me it would work.
Is it working or not?

1000
01:02:21,592 --> 01:02:22,789
It is working, but it's...

1001
01:02:22,888 --> 01:02:25,359
All I'm getting is some
kind of airport beacon.

1002
01:02:25,965 --> 01:02:26,847
It's weird.

1003
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:29,202
It's like the tower isn't there.

1004
01:02:32,045 --> 01:02:33,133
Stay on it.

1005
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:36,552
Let me know when there is
something there.

1006
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:37,375
Ok.

1007
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:19,056
Major Grant. We're Blue Light.
Rollins, Department of Justice.

1008
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:21,013
Trudeau, chief of air operations.

1009
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,349
Lorenzo, terminal police.

1010
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,351
You want something, you got it.

1011
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,990
This is it?
One fucking platoon?

1012
01:03:28,563 --> 01:03:30,033
One crisis, one platoon.

1013
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:32,293
Who are you? John McClane.

1014
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:35,431
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

1015
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:36,152
Yeah.

1016
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:38,444
Now show some good sense.

1017
01:03:38,887 --> 01:03:40,241
Let the pros handle this.

1018
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:42,921
Well, it looks like the pros
are on the wrong team tonight.

1019
01:03:43,355 --> 01:03:44,909
Isn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?

1020
01:03:45,128 --> 01:03:46,565
No, not anymore he's not.

1021
01:03:46,851 --> 01:03:48,920
Now we're here to take
Colonel Stuart down.

1022
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,859
And we will take him down.

1023
01:03:50,984 --> 01:03:52,315
You see, I served with him.

1024
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:54,203
I taught him everything he knows.

1025
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:57,045
Well, maybe he's learned
a few more things since then.

1026
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:00,859
Let's hustle!

1027
01:04:01,101 --> 01:04:03,740
Command post will be set up
in the airport police station.

1028
01:04:03,910 --> 01:04:07,017
I want to be tied in to the tower
in 15 minutes.

1029
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:08,348
Alright, let's do it!

1030
01:04:10,807 --> 01:04:11,930
Hey, Trudeau.

1031
01:04:14,299 --> 01:04:16,101
Things just get better or worse?

1032
01:04:20,532 --> 01:04:22,332
Lights big, portable lights.

1033
01:04:22,714 --> 01:04:23,889
We set up the field,

1034
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,695
and then we...
Wait for those lunatics

1035
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:27,272
to shoot them out?
And where do we get those big,

1036
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:28,956
portable lights borrow them from Batman?

1037
01:04:29,144 --> 01:04:30,599
What about the air phone idea?

1038
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:31,928
There's 18 planes up there.

1039
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,619
Only five of them have those phones.

1040
01:04:33,657 --> 01:04:36,033
We got through to three.
We're still trying on the others.

1041
01:04:36,217 --> 01:04:38,200
That leaves 13 accidents
waiting to happen.

1042
01:04:38,218 --> 01:04:39,448
Are they still bucking headwinds?

1043
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:40,260
I just checked the weather.

1044
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:42,618
Headwinds are slamming
everybody over the outer marker.

1045
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:45,119
The planes with enough fuel
have already been shunted to Atlanta,

1046
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:46,307
Memphis and Nashville.

1047
01:04:47,248 --> 01:04:48,498
Outer marker.

1048
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:49,852
Damn!

1049
01:04:50,878 --> 01:04:52,124
The outer marker!

1050
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:54,340
It's a beacon, right?

1051
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:56,479
A radio beacon that sends out
this beep, beep, beep

1052
01:04:56,481 --> 01:04:57,693
so they know they're over it, right?

1053
01:04:57,695 --> 01:04:58,297
So?

1054
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:00,755
So who says that radio signal
has to just beep?

1055
01:05:00,757 --> 01:05:02,281
Right. We switch the frequency,

1056
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:04,370
from the tower over
to the one in the beacon.

1057
01:05:04,677 --> 01:05:05,939
We pump up the wattage.

1058
01:05:06,044 --> 01:05:09,197
And we can talk to our planes and those
bastards who did this will never know!

1059
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:13,691
Traced the signal.

1060
01:05:14,048 --> 01:05:15,316
Found it in the luggage area.

1061
01:05:15,736 --> 01:05:18,056
They've been tapped
into your tower chatter all night.

1062
01:05:18,492 --> 01:05:20,535
Punks stealing luggage, Carmine?

1063
01:05:24,486 --> 01:05:26,309
How you doing, Telford?
No good.

1064
01:05:27,079 --> 01:05:29,398
I called Langley.
They're rigging a portable decoder.

1065
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:30,681
It'll be here in two hours.

1066
01:05:30,939 --> 01:05:32,234
My wife doesn't have two hours.

1067
01:05:32,251 --> 01:05:34,393
I was only transferred
to Grant's team yesterday.

1068
01:05:34,505 --> 01:05:36,290
The regular guy got appendicitis.

1069
01:05:37,353 --> 01:05:39,590
The word is nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

1070
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:40,819
Attention!

1071
01:05:41,032 --> 01:05:42,532
Except maybe Colonel Stuart.

1072
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,985
I want to hear about the plane
those bastards asked for.

1073
01:05:47,729 --> 01:05:49,291
Then I'll fill you in on my orders.

1074
01:05:49,292 --> 01:05:50,757
Pilots' briefing room. Now.

1075
01:05:51,093 --> 01:05:52,109
Keep working.

1076
01:05:52,111 --> 01:05:52,902
Albertson!

1077
01:05:52,903 --> 01:05:54,031
Sir!
With me.

1078
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:54,717
Yes, sir!

1079
01:05:59,345 --> 01:06:00,510
No civilians.

1080
01:06:11,977 --> 01:06:13,049
What the fuck?

1081
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,809
What is it?

1082
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,523
The outer marker beeper.

1083
01:06:17,994 --> 01:06:19,700
It isn't beeping.
It's talking.

1084
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:22,987
<i>Attention all aircraft
in Dulles landing pattern.</i>

1085
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:24,892
<i>This is Chief Engineer Leslie Barnes.</i>

1086
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,707
I have been authorized
to brief you in full.

1087
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:31,822
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

1088
01:06:32,935 --> 01:06:34,434
Here is the situation.

1089
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,569
Approximately two hours ago,

1090
01:06:40,642 --> 01:06:41,984
Wait till you get a load of this.

1091
01:06:41,995 --> 01:06:44,341
<i>Do not accept any instructions
claiming to be from our tower</i>

1092
01:06:44,343 --> 01:06:47,595
<i>unless you hear your own
flight recorder access code.</i>

1093
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:49,598
<i>The terrorists have got all our systems</i>
Holy shit!

1094
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,107
<i>And now have control of everything</i>
Get this on tape.

1095
01:06:51,146 --> 01:06:52,491
<i>Except this channel.</i>

1096
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:54,836
<i>This channel is secure,</i>
Give us a second here, please.

1097
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:57,485
<i>But your own transmissions are not.</i>

1098
01:06:57,753 --> 01:06:59,309
<i>Do not repeat,</i>

1099
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:03,116
<i>do not attempt to reply on your own
frequencies to this broadcast.</i>

1100
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,248
<i>These people have already caused one
crash by impersonating our tower.</i>

1101
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,116
Jesus.

1102
01:07:19,209 --> 01:07:20,158
<i>Repeat.</i>

1103
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:22,124
<i>The terrorists have cut off
the two systems</i>

1104
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,724
<i>that can allow you to land</i>

1105
01:07:24,049 --> 01:07:25,966
<i>field lights for a visual landing,</i>

1106
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:27,842
<i>and the I.L.S. for an instrument.</i>

1107
01:07:28,407 --> 01:07:30,915
<i>A special U.S. Army unit
is already here</i>

1108
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:32,686
<i>and preparing to take out the terrorists.</i>

1109
01:07:32,968 --> 01:07:34,834
My God.
<i>Don't accept any instructions</i>

1110
01:07:35,414 --> 01:07:36,284
Yo, Marvin.

1111
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,336
Hey, you interested in a nice coat?

1112
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:40,257
No. It never looked good on me anyway.
Come here.

1113
01:07:40,626 --> 01:07:42,740
Listen, you got to get me
up to the pilots' briefing room.

1114
01:07:42,741 --> 01:07:43,711
They're having a little soiree.

1115
01:07:43,713 --> 01:07:46,534
I got to hear what they're saying
even if I got to put a fucking glass to the door.

1116
01:07:46,536 --> 01:07:48,125
Which one of these maps gets me in there?
Don't touch it!

1117
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:49,668
Don't touch it!
Find the map, Marvin.

1118
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:52,805
I'll find it. You'll mess up my
whole damn filing system here.

1119
01:07:52,807 --> 01:07:55,744
Let's see. Pilots' briefing room.
I think that's in the main terminal.

1120
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:57,329
So would that be under,

1121
01:07:57,737 --> 01:07:59,785
P for pilots' briefing room?

1122
01:07:59,793 --> 01:08:00,585
Now, Marvin.

1123
01:08:00,611 --> 01:08:02,133
Or maybe it would be under M,

1124
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:03,749
for miscellaneous.

1125
01:08:08,426 --> 01:08:09,362
Oh, shit!

1126
01:08:09,364 --> 01:08:11,178
<i>This is Garber.
Request permission to reduce</i>

1127
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:12,846
<i>sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.</i>

1128
01:08:12,972 --> 01:08:14,971
<i>My men are getting cold.
They're getting antsy. Over.</i>

1129
01:08:15,156 --> 01:08:16,121
<i>This is Colonel Stuart.</i>

1130
01:08:16,122 --> 01:08:19,120
<i>Garber, please have the men not on
watch assemble for a briefing. Over.</i>

1131
01:08:19,276 --> 01:08:20,820
<i>Roger, Colonel.
Over and out.</i>

1132
01:08:20,822 --> 01:08:21,716
What's the matter?

1133
01:08:24,706 --> 01:08:25,514
Gentlemen,

1134
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:28,212
tonight the pattern ends.

1135
01:08:29,489 --> 01:08:31,609
The dominoes will fall no more,

1136
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:33,584
and the ramparts will remain upright.

1137
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:36,534
Sir, General Esperanza's plane
just came on the scope.

1138
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:44,145
Tracking.

1139
01:08:44,146 --> 01:08:45,320
Attention, Dulles Tower.

1140
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:47,486
<i>We will be lighting up a runway.</i>

1141
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:48,861
<i>Do not, repeat,</i>

1142
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:51,078
<i>do not attempt to land any planes.</i>

1143
01:08:51,681 --> 01:08:53,371
Remember, we're monitoring you.

1144
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,150
What do we do?

1145
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:00,712
Obey.

1146
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,428
<i>Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.</i>

1147
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:12,333
Dulles Tower to Foxtrot Michael One.

1148
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,484
This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.
We read you. Over.

1149
01:09:16,201 --> 01:09:18,392
<i>Foxtrot Michael One,
you are to come in on runway</i>

1150
01:09:18,394 --> 01:09:21,259
1-5, repeat, 1-5.

1151
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,702
I found it on the floor, by the coat,
next to the luggage belt.

1152
01:09:39,767 --> 01:09:41,961
What the hell you so excited about that for?

1153
01:09:42,188 --> 01:09:43,802
The code's still punched into this one.

1154
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:44,816
You like it?

1155
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,640
How about you give me 20 bucks for it?

1156
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:49,948
How about I let you live?

1157
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:53,051
Man knows how to bargain.

1158
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,659
This is contrary to our instructions.

1159
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:58,600
We are to land at runway 1-0.

1160
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:01,628
Where we are to be met
by representatives of your Justice...

1161
01:10:03,256 --> 01:10:04,330
Captain,

1162
01:10:04,332 --> 01:10:07,252
please tell the tower
you will proceed as ordered.

1163
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:19,674
Roger, Dulles.

1164
01:10:21,228 --> 01:10:23,185
Proceeding to runway 1-5.

1165
01:10:39,655 --> 01:10:41,218
Foxtrot Michael One, come in, please.

1166
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,937
What are you going to do now?

1167
01:10:44,423 --> 01:10:46,841
You going to shoot me?
So who will fly the plane?

1168
01:10:47,352 --> 01:10:49,931
Don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.

1169
01:10:57,136 --> 01:10:58,679
Michael One, do you copy?

1170
01:11:02,642 --> 01:11:04,987
Foxtrot Michael One, come in, please.

1171
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:15,593
Eagle Nest.

1172
01:11:15,594 --> 01:11:17,056
<i>This is Falcon. Mayday.</i>

1173
01:11:17,282 --> 01:11:18,345
<i>Eagle Nest.</i>

1174
01:11:18,346 --> 01:11:19,587
<i>This is Falcon. Mayday!</i>

1175
01:11:22,036 --> 01:11:23,293
Go ahead, Falcon.

1176
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:25,339
<i>I've lost cabin pressure.</i>

1177
01:11:25,674 --> 01:11:26,940
<i>Near zero visibility.</i>

1178
01:11:27,464 --> 01:11:29,950
I must drop out of this weather
and land now,

1179
01:11:30,192 --> 01:11:31,787
<i>on the first accessible runway.</i>

1180
01:11:31,963 --> 01:11:32,911
<i>Repeat.</i>

1181
01:11:33,236 --> 01:11:34,613
<i>I've lost cabin pressure.</i>

1182
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:36,121
<i>Near zero visibility.</i>

1183
01:11:36,636 --> 01:11:38,238
<i>I must drop out of the storm.</i>

1184
01:11:38,386 --> 01:11:39,465
<i>I can land,</i>

1185
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:40,966
<i>but I must land now</i>

1186
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:42,848
<i>on the first outgoing runway.</i>

1187
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:44,059
<i>Repeat.</i>

1188
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:46,438
<i>I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.</i>

1189
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:52,149
I'll make you a deal, Marvin.

1190
01:11:52,867 --> 01:11:54,510
You show me a shortcut
out to those runways

1191
01:11:54,512 --> 01:11:56,153
and I'll get you a liner for that coat.

1192
01:11:56,237 --> 01:11:59,529
Repeat. I cannot circle around
to runway 1-5.

1193
01:11:59,657 --> 01:12:00,527
Shit.

1194
01:12:00,957 --> 01:12:02,154
Stand by, Falcon.

1195
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:05,251
Here, sir.

1196
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:06,517
He's coming in from the ocean, sir.

1197
01:12:08,796 --> 01:12:11,214
<i>A bullet has damaged my instruments.</i>

1198
01:12:11,558 --> 01:12:13,038
<i>I'm not sure of my bearing</i>

1199
01:12:13,254 --> 01:12:15,630
<i>and I must make
a visual landing immediately.</i>

1200
01:12:15,715 --> 01:12:17,122
<i>Do you copy, Eagle Nest?</i>

1201
01:12:17,528 --> 01:12:18,550
Roger, Falcon.

1202
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,319
<i>That would be 2-5 right.</i>
What?

1203
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,679
<i>Repeat, 2-5 right.</i>

1204
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,501
<i>Roger.</i>
Make up your fucking mind!

1205
01:12:24,551 --> 01:12:25,325
<i>Repeat.</i>

1206
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,664
<i>Runway 2-5 right.</i>
Oh, we are just up to our ass

1207
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:29,061
in terrorists again, John.

1208
01:12:29,063 --> 01:12:31,341
<i>Affirmative. 2-5 right. Over.</i>

1209
01:12:31,721 --> 01:12:32,654
2-5 right.

1210
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,417
I got to quit smoking cigarettes.

1211
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:39,237
<i>Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.</i>

1212
01:12:39,978 --> 01:12:41,738
But if you could show it to me as well,

1213
01:12:41,739 --> 01:12:43,021
<i>I would be grateful.</i>

1214
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,691
<i>I see the lights.</i>

1215
01:12:56,193 --> 01:12:58,616
<i>They are directly in front of me.
Gracias, compadre.</i>

1216
01:12:59,211 --> 01:13:00,355
<i>Reducing airspeed.</i>

1217
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:02,023
<i>Approaching runway.</i>

1218
01:13:02,303 --> 01:13:03,348
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

1219
01:13:03,694 --> 01:13:04,976
Roger, Falcon.

1220
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,863
We copy.
We'll have you in five minutes.

1221
01:13:09,514 --> 01:13:11,915
That's right, asshole.
We'll have you in five minutes.

1222
01:13:36,305 --> 01:13:37,427
<i>I see your lights.</i>

1223
01:13:38,101 --> 01:13:39,381
<i>E.T.A. 90 seconds.</i>

1224
01:13:48,782 --> 01:13:50,728
Come to papa, scumbag.

1225
01:14:46,455 --> 01:14:47,515
Oh, shit!

1226
01:15:48,121 --> 01:15:49,043
Freedom.

1227
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:51,594
Not yet.

1228
01:15:54,176 --> 01:15:57,060
You're supposed to stay in your seat
until the plane reaches the terminal.

1229
01:15:57,497 --> 01:15:59,353
No frequent-flyer mileage for you.

1230
01:15:59,738 --> 01:16:00,718
Who are you?

1231
01:16:00,943 --> 01:16:01,730
A cop.

1232
01:16:01,988 --> 01:16:02,542
A cop?

1233
01:16:02,543 --> 01:16:03,962
Yeah, one of the good guys.

1234
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:05,474
You see you're one of the bad guys.

1235
01:16:05,476 --> 01:16:08,378
And now that I got your sorry ass,
I'm gonna trade it for my wife.

1236
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:18,810
Sit down!

1237
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:23,812
I'm going in!
I got you covered.

1238
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,018
Where'd he go?

1239
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:32,039
In there.

1240
01:16:42,401 --> 01:16:44,691
I don't believe this 2 months of planning,

1241
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:47,110
and you can't anticipate one
pendejo nfa cop.

1242
01:16:47,112 --> 01:16:49,237
Come on, General.
Where the hell is Colonel Stuart?

1243
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:55,424
General!
I am alright.

1244
01:16:56,207 --> 01:16:57,486
He said he was a policeman.

1245
01:16:57,937 --> 01:16:59,516
I thought you had this place secured.

1246
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:01,207
He went in the cockpit.

1247
01:17:01,792 --> 01:17:02,941
He's going to hell!

1248
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,481
McClane!

1249
01:17:06,464 --> 01:17:08,303
I assume it's you, McClane.

1250
01:17:09,444 --> 01:17:11,042
You're quite a little soldier.

1251
01:17:12,317 --> 01:17:14,555
You can consider this a military funeral!

1252
01:17:40,156 --> 01:17:41,452
How many grenades we got?

1253
01:17:41,454 --> 01:17:42,418
Three each!

1254
01:17:43,301 --> 01:17:44,253
Use them!

1255
01:17:55,074 --> 01:17:56,045
Oh, fuck.

1256
01:17:58,005 --> 01:17:58,661
Shit

1257
01:18:10,569 --> 01:18:11,538
Go!

1258
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:30,338
Oh, shit!

1259
01:18:39,746 --> 01:18:41,199
You lucky fuck.

1260
01:18:44,562 --> 01:18:45,631
Fire trucks, sir.

1261
01:18:46,006 --> 01:18:47,240
Fall back to the church.

1262
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:48,145
Now!

1263
01:19:10,569 --> 01:19:12,203
Where's the fucking door?

1264
01:19:27,573 --> 01:19:29,399
You know they're getting a little
nervous back there.

1265
01:19:29,406 --> 01:19:30,657
In fact, so am I.

1266
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:32,404
We're right over Washington.

1267
01:19:32,406 --> 01:19:33,687
See if you can get any TV.

1268
01:19:33,688 --> 01:19:34,774
That'll settle them down.

1269
01:19:35,356 --> 01:19:36,541
Works for me.

1270
01:20:01,025 --> 01:20:04,017
Writing your acceptance speech
for the Video Sleaze Awards?

1271
01:20:05,275 --> 01:20:06,350
Try Pulitzer.

1272
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:07,267
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

1283
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,003
Put me through to Ruben
in the newsroom.

1284
01:20:49,448 --> 01:20:51,500
<i>He's about to go live.</i>
I know he's about to go on.

1285
01:20:51,502 --> 01:20:52,519
That's why I need him.

1286
01:20:52,913 --> 01:20:54,008
<i>You'll have to hold on.</i>

1287
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:56,501
Put me through, Celia,
or start typing your résumé.

1288
01:20:58,129 --> 01:20:59,465
Esperanza's down.

1289
01:21:01,177 --> 01:21:02,147
But he's hurt.

1290
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:04,555
He took a round in his shoulder.

1291
01:21:05,231 --> 01:21:06,507
Plus I got one more of their guys.

1292
01:21:06,509 --> 01:21:07,910
That's six they lost altogether.

1293
01:21:07,912 --> 01:21:11,066
Well maybe if we knew how many
they had to start with, we could get excited.

1294
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,512
But if they got 50 guys,

1295
01:21:12,513 --> 01:21:14,791
it's a little early to break
out the champagne!

1296
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,791
We appreciate your effort, McClane, but
we don't need a loose cannon on this deck!

1297
01:21:18,876 --> 01:21:20,745
What if they decide
to crash another plane

1298
01:21:20,746 --> 01:21:22,470
in retaliation for your little stunt?

1299
01:21:22,472 --> 01:21:24,322
They can't do that anymore, right, Barnes?

1300
01:21:24,763 --> 01:21:27,557
Besides, if I grabbed
Esperanza, this would all be over by now.

1301
01:21:27,641 --> 01:21:30,310
Well, maybe they're just
a little bit more creative than you think!

1302
01:21:30,394 --> 01:21:32,144
Well, at least I'm thinking, goddamn it!

1303
01:21:32,146 --> 01:21:33,614
Listen, you wise-ass,

1304
01:21:33,692 --> 01:21:37,442
we're here to jerk off that cocksucker
until he tries to take off, period!

1305
01:21:37,526 --> 01:21:40,653
Now you're the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time!

1306
01:21:43,457 --> 01:21:44,648
The story of my life.

1307
01:21:46,287 --> 01:21:47,051
Major,

1308
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:48,995
Pentagon Situation Room, sir!

1309
01:21:49,288 --> 01:21:51,241
Pentagon. I'll take it in here.

1310
01:21:51,752 --> 01:21:52,590
Thank you, Telford.

1311
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,145
You men come with me.

1312
01:21:57,349 --> 01:21:59,103
McClane.
Yeah, Barnes.

1313
01:21:59,392 --> 01:22:01,283
You said those guys showed
up out there right away?

1314
01:22:01,285 --> 01:22:02,030
Yeah.

1315
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:04,584
So. So that must mean
they're on the field or close.

1316
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:06,899
And I think I know where.

1317
01:22:07,633 --> 01:22:09,069
Come here.
Let me show you something.

1318
01:22:11,685 --> 01:22:15,688
These are the old plans when the longer
runways went in. That's, that's 12 years ago.

1319
01:22:16,393 --> 01:22:18,880
Looks like they've done
some modifications on-site,

1320
01:22:18,882 --> 01:22:22,247
moved TRACON phones, I.L.S.,
all the underground stuff,

1321
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:24,029
so they could handle drainage.

1322
01:22:24,323 --> 01:22:25,263
If I'm right,

1323
01:22:25,264 --> 01:22:27,888
all of it would run right
along the airport property

1324
01:22:27,904 --> 01:22:29,679
and go right past this neighborhood.

1325
01:22:33,831 --> 01:22:35,496
We should have been
on the ground two hours ago!

1326
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:37,408
I understand,
but if you just relax a little.

1327
01:22:37,455 --> 01:22:39,018
Come on, lady.
Who you trying to kid?

1328
01:22:39,019 --> 01:22:40,046
It's hopeless.

1329
01:22:41,342 --> 01:22:44,584
Somebody ought to get their ass
kicked for this mess. That's for sure.

1330
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:48,943
Well unfortunately there really isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

1331
01:22:48,973 --> 01:22:49,805
Oh, yeah?

1332
01:22:49,806 --> 01:22:51,734
What about that porker Willard Scott?

1333
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,893
I should have taken the bus.

1334
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,973
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1335
01:22:57,304 --> 01:22:58,277
Excuse me.

1336
01:22:58,711 --> 01:22:59,471
Yes?

1337
01:23:00,637 --> 01:23:01,851
I was just wondering.

1338
01:23:02,652 --> 01:23:06,322
This flight originally was supposed
to be five and a half hours, right?

1339
01:23:07,335 --> 01:23:10,263
Do we have enough fuel
to keep circling like this?

1340
01:23:10,396 --> 01:23:13,190
Oh, of course.
They anticipate little problems like this.

1341
01:23:31,849 --> 01:23:34,434
Barnes, we looked at 12 fucking houses,
and we're nowhere.

1342
01:23:34,815 --> 01:23:36,615
This is our last possibility.

1343
01:23:37,832 --> 01:23:39,522
Over here there is an old church.

1344
01:23:39,606 --> 01:23:40,365
Let's go.

1345
01:23:45,706 --> 01:23:46,433
Wait.

1346
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:55,804
There's the church over there.

1347
01:24:04,478 --> 01:24:05,799
Could be a sentry.

1348
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,759
And he could just be out for a walk.

1349
01:24:08,015 --> 01:24:10,475
Then why is he going over
his own footsteps?

1350
01:24:13,232 --> 01:24:14,143
Come on.

1351
01:24:16,669 --> 01:24:17,366
Alright.

1352
01:24:18,378 --> 01:24:20,222
Just stay here and get
ready to call the marines.

1353
01:24:20,415 --> 01:24:21,776
I thought they were the army.

1354
01:24:22,031 --> 01:24:24,023
Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.

1355
01:24:41,252 --> 01:24:42,160
Oh, shit.

1356
01:24:44,236 --> 01:24:45,129
Not now.

1357
01:24:59,587 --> 01:25:01,515
Lorenzo, it's Barnes.

1358
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,776
<i>Barnes, where the hell did you go?
Where's McClane?</i>

1359
01:25:03,823 --> 01:25:04,492
He's with me.

1360
01:25:04,493 --> 01:25:07,007
We're at the Highland Lake Community
Church on the west side of the airport.

1361
01:25:07,233 --> 01:25:08,183
You're where?

1362
01:25:08,184 --> 01:25:10,435
Goddamn it!
You crazy idiot, why didn't...

1363
01:25:10,437 --> 01:25:11,729
<i>This must be their base of operations.</i>

1364
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:13,688
<i>Shut up and get your ass over here!
Move it!</i>

1365
01:25:13,783 --> 01:25:15,336
Code red! Sit rep.

1366
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:18,456
We got positive I.D. on Stuart's location.

1367
01:25:18,457 --> 01:25:19,163
Let's move.

1368
01:25:19,345 --> 01:25:20,800
Yo!
Yes, sir.

1369
01:25:31,552 --> 01:25:34,178
Our escape plane will be ready
within 30 minutes, General.

1370
01:25:36,306 --> 01:25:38,269
If there are no more surprises.

1371
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:55,904
Gentlemen, we have a situation here.

1372
01:27:13,855 --> 01:27:14,654
Over here.

1373
01:27:27,899 --> 01:27:30,151
Geez, McClane, you alright?
You want a medic?

1374
01:27:30,337 --> 01:27:33,506
McClane, what the hell you think
you're doing out there, playing John Wayne?

1375
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:35,841
How would you like
to spend the night in a cell?

1376
01:27:35,843 --> 01:27:38,341
Lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.

1377
01:27:38,342 --> 01:27:39,470
Go seal off the street.

1378
01:27:39,513 --> 01:27:41,658
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.

1379
01:27:41,791 --> 01:27:42,847
Oh, no, Carmine?

1380
01:27:43,019 --> 01:27:46,811
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat
out of Mr. McClane's face now.

1381
01:27:46,895 --> 01:27:48,387
With pleasure, sir.

1382
01:27:51,142 --> 01:27:51,916
Major,

1383
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:54,277
the men are in position, sir.

1384
01:27:54,513 --> 01:27:56,445
Close up the back.
Then we go in.

1385
01:27:56,467 --> 01:27:57,709
Fire only on my order.

1386
01:27:57,711 --> 01:27:58,754
Roger that, sir.

1387
01:27:59,337 --> 01:28:00,786
Guess I was wrong about you.

1388
01:28:01,574 --> 01:28:03,494
You're not such an asshole after all.

1389
01:28:03,903 --> 01:28:05,030
No, you were right.

1390
01:28:05,519 --> 01:28:07,164
Well I'm just your kind of asshole.

1391
01:28:16,446 --> 01:28:18,217
Garber, sit rep!

1392
01:28:18,872 --> 01:28:20,801
Army Special Forces on three sides,

1393
01:28:20,802 --> 01:28:22,461
closing in fast around the back!

1394
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,778
Another problem, Colonel?

1395
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:25,076
No problem, General.

1396
01:28:25,946 --> 01:28:27,955
Gentlemen, you know what to do.

1397
01:28:39,843 --> 01:28:41,606
Down!
Get down! Get down!

1398
01:29:10,435 --> 01:29:11,243
General!

1399
01:29:12,453 --> 01:29:13,285
It's time.

1400
01:29:20,316 --> 01:29:21,633
Come on. Let's move it!

1401
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:38,923
They're pulling out!
What?

1402
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:40,004
Out the back!

1403
01:29:47,933 --> 01:29:48,717
Move it!

1404
01:29:59,209 --> 01:30:01,185
Albertson, take your men
around the back.

1405
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:29,804
This equipment,
it could land our planes.

1406
01:30:29,936 --> 01:30:30,973
Don't touch anything.

1407
01:30:30,975 --> 01:30:32,337
There were trip wires outside.

1408
01:30:32,338 --> 01:30:33,557
They could have booby-trapped...
They did.

1409
01:30:33,753 --> 01:30:36,962
Got one here. Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

1410
01:30:37,188 --> 01:30:38,962
Clear the area!
Everybody, now!

1411
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,007
They booby-trapped all the equipment.

1412
01:30:45,009 --> 01:30:46,448
Seal off the building!
Shit!

1413
01:30:47,374 --> 01:30:49,451
Secure the area.
Post sentries. No civilians allowed.

1414
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:52,353
Hey, where the fuck is McClane?

1415
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,391
Miller, take him!

1416
01:31:45,654 --> 01:31:46,708
I'll cover you!

1417
01:32:10,938 --> 01:32:11,788
Goddamn!

1418
01:32:33,896 --> 01:32:35,702
So much for the element of chance.

1419
01:32:37,329 --> 01:32:38,274
Let's move out.

1420
01:32:56,419 --> 01:32:58,006
I had the bastard in my sights.

1421
01:32:58,068 --> 01:32:59,185
I know I did.

1422
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,332
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1423
01:33:16,683 --> 01:33:17,892
<i>Attention, Tower.</i>

1424
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:19,587
<i>Attention, Dulles Tower.</i>

1425
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:22,140
<i>This is Colonel Stuart.
Is our plane prepared?</i>

1426
01:33:22,718 --> 01:33:24,395
It is.
It's in Hangar 11.

1427
01:33:24,397 --> 01:33:26,122
It's the most remote building we've got.

1428
01:33:27,444 --> 01:33:28,856
We're on our way.

1429
01:33:29,549 --> 01:33:32,592
<i>Have a ground crew there
to confirm the condition of the plane.</i>

1430
01:33:33,549 --> 01:33:35,992
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

1431
01:33:36,623 --> 01:33:39,747
Colonel, you're quite capable
of confirming it yourself.

1432
01:33:39,831 --> 01:33:42,982
<i>Now please, don't ask us
to gift wrap potential hostages for you.</i>

1433
01:33:42,999 --> 01:33:44,403
Major Grant, isn't it?

1434
01:33:44,825 --> 01:33:46,188
<i>If you remember me Colonel,</i>

1435
01:33:46,691 --> 01:33:48,756
<i>then you remember I know
the drill as well as you do.</i>

1436
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,137
Check out your own fucking plane.

1437
01:33:52,866 --> 01:33:54,319
We move out in five minutes.

1438
01:33:54,926 --> 01:33:56,531
Flak-jackets for everybody.

1439
01:33:56,851 --> 01:33:58,489
Body armor for the assault team.

1440
01:33:58,913 --> 01:34:00,532
Night scopes for the snipers.

1441
01:34:01,165 --> 01:34:04,007
We will take them in the hangar,
and I will pull that detonator

1442
01:34:04,009 --> 01:34:06,487
out of Stuart's dead fucking hand myself.

1443
01:34:07,819 --> 01:34:08,740
Lorenzo,

1444
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:10,742
take all your men back to the airport. Sir.

1445
01:34:10,744 --> 01:34:12,186
Seal off every exit

1446
01:34:12,512 --> 01:34:14,258
in case any of them tries to slip past us,

1447
01:34:14,326 --> 01:34:15,742
to break out onto the ground.

1448
01:34:15,743 --> 01:34:16,886
You got it.

1449
01:34:19,217 --> 01:34:21,078
Alright, here we go.

1450
01:34:21,985 --> 01:34:24,808
<i>Dick, this is nuts. Every station
in town has people at the airport</i>

1451
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:26,920
<i>and none has heard
a whisper of this shit you're running!</i>

1452
01:34:26,922 --> 01:34:30,089
Well, none of them is me.
You want proof? Try this.

1453
01:34:30,864 --> 01:34:33,470
<i>Repeat.
Terrorists have murdered civilians</i>

1454
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:36,184
<i>and cut off the two systems
that can allow you to land.</i>

1455
01:34:36,689 --> 01:34:39,209
<i>A special U.S. Army unit is already here</i>

1456
01:34:39,637 --> 01:34:41,478
<i>and preparing to take out the terrorists.</i>
Jesus Christ.

1457
01:34:41,813 --> 01:34:43,267
<i>I want you to go live now.</i>

1458
01:34:43,329 --> 01:34:45,288
<i>Key me in from the files
a publicity shot, whatever.</i>

1459
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:47,187
Connie's got one and a map.
Steal one from weather.

1460
01:34:47,189 --> 01:34:48,234
We're on it. We're on it.

1461
01:34:48,235 --> 01:34:49,560
We're cutting in five minutes!

1462
01:34:50,126 --> 01:34:52,448
Tell the affiliates if they want in,
they got three minutes to shout.

1463
01:34:52,662 --> 01:34:53,741
Let's do this.

1464
01:34:55,278 --> 01:34:56,624
Network, here I come.

1465
01:35:00,178 --> 01:35:04,173
Hey Telford, what was your chickenshit
outfit doing while we were taking Grenada?

1466
01:35:07,196 --> 01:35:08,068
Grenada,

1467
01:35:08,834 --> 01:35:11,699
five minutes of firefight,
five weeks of surfing.

1468
01:35:12,383 --> 01:35:13,978
I wish I was with you guys for that.

1469
01:35:14,345 --> 01:35:15,208
Yeah.

1470
01:35:15,455 --> 01:35:16,455
Me too, kid.

1471
01:35:17,004 --> 01:35:17,963
Really, sir?

1472
01:35:18,396 --> 01:35:19,303
Sure.

1473
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,356
Then we would not have to do this.

1474
01:35:38,058 --> 01:35:40,133
Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.

1475
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:42,414
On schedule

1476
01:35:43,096 --> 01:35:44,079
and in position.

1477
01:35:44,295 --> 01:35:46,457
Roger, Hatchling.
We are secure here.

1478
01:35:46,939 --> 01:35:48,339
You have a green light.

1479
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:49,595
I repeat,

1480
01:35:49,924 --> 01:35:51,282
a green light.

1481
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,373
Jesus Officer,

1482
01:36:04,374 --> 01:36:06,456
where'd you come from, Pearl Harbor?

1483
01:36:11,827 --> 01:36:13,226
Alright, let's clear it out, please.

1484
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:16,612
Stand by.

1485
01:36:17,672 --> 01:36:19,547
Five, four, three

1486
01:36:20,799 --> 01:36:23,742
<i>This is a special bulletin from WZDC News.</i>

1487
01:36:23,826 --> 01:36:26,197
<i>There was a plane crash
earlier this evening at Dulles,</i>

1488
01:36:26,251 --> 01:36:28,252
<i>where other aircraft continue to circle,</i>

1489
01:36:28,325 --> 01:36:31,064
<i>with no explanation from airport
or F.A.A. officials.</i>

1490
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:34,396
Quiet!
<i>And now, with an exclusive WZDC report</i>

1491
01:36:34,654 --> 01:36:37,528
<i>here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.</i>

1492
01:36:37,535 --> 01:36:38,295
Can you turn it up?

1493
01:36:38,448 --> 01:36:41,964
<i>I'm one of the thousand people who
has been circling our nation's capital</i>

1494
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:44,070
<i>under the assumption
that whatever problem</i>

1495
01:36:44,071 --> 01:36:46,538
<i>was going on far below
was a normal one.</i>

1496
01:36:47,105 --> 01:36:49,027
<i>But the truth is far from normal.</i>

1497
01:36:49,395 --> 01:36:50,964
<i>The truth is terrifying.</i>

1498
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,709
Look out!
Lady, look out!

1499
01:36:54,567 --> 01:36:56,492
Look out! Look out!

1500
01:36:56,493 --> 01:36:57,903
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

1501
01:36:58,881 --> 01:37:00,027
Get out of the way!

1502
01:37:00,055 --> 01:37:01,827
Move!
Get out of the way, lady!

1503
01:37:01,902 --> 01:37:03,746
Go! Go! Hey!
Hey! Look out!

1504
01:37:04,035 --> 01:37:06,116
This is a recording of a conversation,

1505
01:37:06,118 --> 01:37:09,045
between Dulles Tower
and the captive aircraft overhead.

1506
01:37:11,282 --> 01:37:13,192
Hey! Get out of the way!

1507
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:14,805
Scary!
Lorenzo!

1508
01:37:15,554 --> 01:37:16,492
Lorenzo!

1509
01:37:16,979 --> 01:37:18,630
McClane, are you out of your fucking mind?

1510
01:37:18,632 --> 01:37:19,631
The Blue Light Team, where are they?

1511
01:37:19,633 --> 01:37:22,873
Stuart's got explosives on the equipment
in the church rigged with a remote.

1512
01:37:22,887 --> 01:37:23,512
Where's Grant?

1513
01:37:23,538 --> 01:37:25,865
Grant's boys are gonna kill that
son of a bitch and get it problems.

1514
01:37:25,867 --> 01:37:27,696
They're gonna do, they're gonna
get on the same goddanm plane

1515
01:37:27,697 --> 01:37:28,568
with him and take off with him!

1516
01:37:28,594 --> 01:37:29,777
Get the fuck out of here!

1517
01:37:29,779 --> 01:37:30,990
When the army canned Stuart,

1518
01:37:30,991 --> 01:37:32,588
he must have loaded
that unit with his own men!

1519
01:37:32,613 --> 01:37:34,494
Are you nuts? That firefight out...

1520
01:37:34,495 --> 01:37:36,607
That firefight Sideshow to jerk us off,
buy them some time.

1521
01:37:36,609 --> 01:37:38,776
McClane, you are completely
around the fucking bend.

1522
01:37:38,778 --> 01:37:40,795
You know that and you know
what else you're under arrest.

1523
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:41,747
You motherfucker!

1524
01:37:48,225 --> 01:37:48,923
Here!

1525
01:37:49,076 --> 01:37:50,873
These are the bullets
they used out there tonight!

1526
01:37:51,309 --> 01:37:52,231
Blanks!

1527
01:37:55,493 --> 01:37:56,556
Jesus Christ.

1528
01:38:04,721 --> 01:38:06,480
<i>This is Chief Lorenzo.</i>

1529
01:38:06,764 --> 01:38:08,411
<i>I want every officer recalled</i>

1530
01:38:08,412 --> 01:38:10,468
<i>and assembled in body
armor and full weaponry</i>

1531
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:12,185
<i>in the motor pool in five minutes.</i>

1532
01:38:14,939 --> 01:38:16,575
It's time to kick ass.

1533
01:38:19,068 --> 01:38:21,445
Just like lwo Jima!

1534
01:38:21,447 --> 01:38:24,317
<i>Since then, this reporter
has learned that the terrorists</i>

1535
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:26,756
<i>have virtual control of the entire airport.</i>

1536
01:38:27,478 --> 01:38:29,933
<i>A fact that the authorities have repressed.</i>

1537
01:38:30,372 --> 01:38:32,361
<i>The terrorists promise more bloodshed</i>

1538
01:38:32,363 --> 01:38:34,176
<i>unless their demands are met.</i>

1539
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:37,547
And now that the special army commandos
have arrived at the airport,

1540
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:42,026
the likelihood of a full-scale
and deadly battle is dangerously close.

1541
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,865
That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.

1542
01:39:07,112 --> 01:39:08,580
It's all over the airport.

1543
01:39:14,001 --> 01:39:16,160
<i>And unfortunately they may not be the last.</i>

1544
01:39:16,871 --> 01:39:19,628
<i>The horrifying fact is that no one is safe,</i>

1545
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:23,273
<i>either in the planes above Dulles
or in the terminal below.</i>

1546
01:39:24,044 --> 01:39:26,718
<i>The threat of a new and higher
body count at the airport</i>

1547
01:39:26,803 --> 01:39:28,902
<i>hangs over the heads of everyone</i>

1548
01:39:29,138 --> 01:39:32,828
<i>and the holiday season
of peace and love has become a nightmare.</i>

1549
01:39:39,739 --> 01:39:41,544
Alright, listen up all units!

1550
01:39:41,897 --> 01:39:44,340
I want you to converge on Hangar 11.

1551
01:39:44,537 --> 01:39:45,462
All sides!

1552
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,488
This car, McClane! Get in!

1553
01:39:47,981 --> 01:39:50,526
When the city blue show up
with their backup,

1554
01:39:50,770 --> 01:39:53,602
they'll pick up the pieces!
Now, move out!

1555
01:39:54,842 --> 01:39:56,834
McClane, say hi to my brother Vito.

1556
01:39:57,656 --> 01:39:59,024
Merry Christmas.

1557
01:39:59,964 --> 01:40:00,675
Hi.

1558
01:40:05,176 --> 01:40:05,652
Shit!

1559
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:08,713
Goddamn it to hell!

1560
01:40:08,715 --> 01:40:11,564
Move that piece of shit!
What's the matter with you?

1561
01:40:11,670 --> 01:40:13,264
I didn't even see you, man.

1562
01:40:13,266 --> 01:40:15,917
Will you move that goddamn
piece of shit out of here!

1563
01:40:16,075 --> 01:40:20,346
Vito, get the fuck out of the car and get your
ass in gear and help me, for Christ's sake!

1564
01:40:20,677 --> 01:40:24,317
Will you get move that car back right now, lady!

1565
01:40:24,402 --> 01:40:25,838
Right there. Right there.
Get that.

1566
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:26,611
Hey!

1567
01:40:27,133 --> 01:40:28,121
Coleman!

1568
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:29,358
Sam!

1569
01:40:30,026 --> 01:40:31,150
Sam Coleman!

1570
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:34,018
Hey, Coleman!

1571
01:40:34,434 --> 01:40:35,147
Hi!

1572
01:40:35,522 --> 01:40:36,390
Coleman!

1573
01:40:38,064 --> 01:40:39,483
But at least the truth,

1574
01:40:40,059 --> 01:40:41,663
is not among the hostages,

1575
01:40:42,121 --> 01:40:43,377
because I,

1576
01:40:43,742 --> 01:40:46,239
Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here,

1577
01:40:46,966 --> 01:40:48,259
to put his life...

1578
01:40:48,799 --> 01:40:49,718
and talent,

1579
01:40:50,473 --> 01:40:52,315
on the line for humanity

1580
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:53,340
and country.

1581
01:40:53,342 --> 01:40:55,598
And if this should be my final broadcast

1582
01:40:58,405 --> 01:40:59,689
Amen to that,

1583
01:41:00,192 --> 01:41:00,826
Dick.

1584
01:41:01,981 --> 01:41:02,584
<i>Dick?</i>

1585
01:41:03,216 --> 01:41:04,224
<i>We're live, Dick.</i>

1586
01:41:05,130 --> 01:41:06,238
<i>Where are you now?</i>

1587
01:41:06,646 --> 01:41:07,427
<i>Dick?</i>

1588
01:41:09,905 --> 01:41:11,490
Truck lights approaching, sir.

1589
01:41:11,574 --> 01:41:12,467
<i>They're here,</i>

1590
01:41:12,468 --> 01:41:13,648
<i>right on schedule.</i>

1591
01:41:14,598 --> 01:41:16,187
The hangar door, open it.

1592
01:41:17,094 --> 01:41:18,039
Clockwork.

1593
01:41:41,799 --> 01:41:44,174
Geez, you give me this story,
and I'll have your baby.

1594
01:41:45,858 --> 01:41:47,618
Not the kind of ride I'm looking for.

1595
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:02,733
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1596
01:42:02,897 --> 01:42:03,956
Thank you, Major.

1597
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,065
You're not so bad yourself.

1598
01:42:06,337 --> 01:42:08,255
Congratulations on your escape, sir.

1599
01:42:08,339 --> 01:42:09,164
Thank you, Major.

1600
01:42:09,752 --> 01:42:11,933
Maybe you should save them
until we are all safe?

1601
01:42:12,565 --> 01:42:14,758
Sir.
My congratulations, gentlemen.

1602
01:42:15,325 --> 01:42:17,430
You've won a victory for our way of life

1603
01:42:17,515 --> 01:42:19,414
my pride, my admiration,

1604
01:42:19,415 --> 01:42:21,309
and a kick-ass vacation.

1605
01:42:21,394 --> 01:42:22,603
Now get on board.

1606
01:42:53,794 --> 01:42:55,136
What's the matter cowboy,
ride too rough?

1607
01:42:55,137 --> 01:42:56,302
I don't like to fly.

1608
01:42:56,612 --> 01:42:58,790
Then what are you doing here?
I don't like to lose either.

1609
01:42:59,669 --> 01:43:01,511
Ok!
Here we go!

1610
01:43:11,078 --> 01:43:14,565
I don't know about you guys, but I've seen
enough fucking snow to last me a lifetime.

1611
01:43:15,087 --> 01:43:16,884
They don't get much of that
in the tropics, Major.

1612
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:18,135
For you, gentlemen,

1613
01:43:18,136 --> 01:43:19,413
we'll import it.

1614
01:43:22,553 --> 01:43:23,967
Shit! They left the hangar!

1615
01:43:27,876 --> 01:43:29,588
Right there. Right there.
Get that.

1616
01:43:30,338 --> 01:43:31,538
Alright, now what?

1617
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:32,944
Get in front of them!
Take it down!

1618
01:43:32,946 --> 01:43:34,758
Block their path
so they can't get out of there!

1619
01:43:34,842 --> 01:43:36,663
I'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

1620
01:43:36,664 --> 01:43:38,745
I'm crazy man, but I ain't that crazy.
Forget it.

1621
01:43:38,861 --> 01:43:40,671
<i>Dulles, this is Northeast 140.</i>

1622
01:43:40,772 --> 01:43:42,974
<i>Request clearance on first available runway.</i>
That's Holly's plane.

1623
01:43:43,059 --> 01:43:45,147
<i>Repeat. Request emergency clearance.</i>

1624
01:43:45,557 --> 01:43:47,979
<i>I know you're not gonna answer to me,
but you Goddamn better listen!</i>

1625
01:43:48,285 --> 01:43:50,065
We're down to fumes and we have to land,

1626
01:43:50,149 --> 01:43:51,843
and in five minutes we're coming in,

1627
01:43:51,844 --> 01:43:52,821
<i>one way or another.</i>

1628
01:43:52,823 --> 01:43:54,582
Goddamn it.
That's my wife's plane!

1629
01:43:54,583 --> 01:43:55,654
Take it fucking down!

1630
01:43:55,656 --> 01:43:57,333
I'm not getting in front of that plane!

1631
01:44:02,697 --> 01:44:04,439
Alright, how about getting over top of it?

1632
01:44:04,996 --> 01:44:06,677
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.</i>

1633
01:44:06,679 --> 01:44:07,499
Your attention.

1634
01:44:07,583 --> 01:44:08,890
We have no choice,

1635
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:10,919
but to attempt an emergency landing.

1636
01:44:11,003 --> 01:44:12,328
<i>Please fasten your seat belts</i>

1637
01:44:12,635 --> 01:44:14,003
<i>and assume crash positions</i>

1638
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,924
as instructed by your cabin attendants.

1639
01:44:16,982 --> 01:44:18,326
Let's have the emergency checklist.

1640
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,140
Attention all air traffic on
this frequency in Dulles area.

1641
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:22,550
This is Northeast 140.

1642
01:44:22,743 --> 01:44:24,620
We're going to attempt
an emergency landing.

1643
01:44:24,664 --> 01:44:25,537
Be advised.

1644
01:44:27,311 --> 01:44:31,064
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1645
01:44:31,148 --> 01:44:33,761
Just buckle your seat belt.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1646
01:44:33,763 --> 01:44:35,322
You're gonna be alright.
Lean forward now.

1647
01:44:35,323 --> 01:44:36,394
Thank you.
God!

1648
01:44:38,363 --> 01:44:39,370
God!

1649
01:44:45,284 --> 01:44:46,364
Oh, God.

1650
01:44:47,873 --> 01:44:48,651
Oh, God.

1651
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:51,674
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

1652
01:44:58,817 --> 01:45:00,709
Hang on!
What are you doing?

1653
01:45:00,711 --> 01:45:01,441
Hang on!

1654
01:45:01,504 --> 01:45:02,897
You wanted a story, didn't you?

1655
01:45:03,327 --> 01:45:04,425
Nice and easy, boys.

1656
01:45:04,427 --> 01:45:06,086
Get me in low!
You got it!

1657
01:45:08,602 --> 01:45:09,788
Where are you going?

1658
01:45:10,304 --> 01:45:11,312
Bring me down!

1659
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:13,728
You'll get yourself killed!
Come back inside!

1660
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:23,459
Bring it in low!
Keep over the wing!

1661
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:32,706
Lower!

1662
01:45:42,678 --> 01:45:43,552
John,

1663
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:46,389
what the fuck are you doing
out on the wing of this plane?

1664
01:45:54,157 --> 01:45:54,870
Damn!

1665
01:46:00,491 --> 01:46:01,988
Mierda.
What?

1666
01:46:02,073 --> 01:46:03,544
There's something wrong.

1667
01:46:04,665 --> 01:46:05,920
The ailerons.

1668
01:46:06,327 --> 01:46:07,554
We can't take off.

1669
01:46:11,374 --> 01:46:12,786
Hijo de puta.

1670
01:46:13,513 --> 01:46:14,792
It's McClane again.

1671
01:46:15,763 --> 01:46:17,294
Son of a bitch!

1672
01:46:19,110 --> 01:46:20,292
I'll do him.

1673
01:46:21,533 --> 01:46:22,552
This time do it right.

1674
01:46:22,554 --> 01:46:24,330
You just get us in the air, General.

1675
01:46:24,549 --> 01:46:26,035
You're the only man who can do it.

1676
01:46:26,037 --> 01:46:28,201
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fueled.

1677
01:47:20,877 --> 01:47:22,092
Too bad, McClane.

1678
01:47:22,382 --> 01:47:23,712
I kind of liked you!

1679
01:47:24,717 --> 01:47:25,963
Goddamn traitor!

1680
01:47:31,579 --> 01:47:33,129
I got enough friends!

1681
01:48:10,367 --> 01:48:11,545
Ok, McClane,

1682
01:48:12,033 --> 01:48:13,402
time for the main event!

1683
01:48:49,573 --> 01:48:51,414
This is for Flight 114, motherfucker!

1684
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:04,401
How's it going?

1685
01:49:08,133 --> 01:49:09,954
Bon voyage!

1686
01:49:16,934 --> 01:49:18,804
Happy landings, asshole!

1687
01:50:10,222 --> 01:50:12,281
Yippie-kai-yay, motherfucker.

1688
01:50:24,877 --> 01:50:26,711
Yeah. Alright.

1689
01:50:52,723 --> 01:50:53,484
Fuck.

1690
01:51:04,343 --> 01:51:05,860
Holly!

1691
01:51:06,627 --> 01:51:09,075
Here's your fucking landing light!

1692
01:51:16,887 --> 01:51:18,185
Oh, God.

1693
01:51:20,766 --> 01:51:25,144
Look! Look!
Ok. I see it! I see it!

1694
01:51:50,504 --> 01:51:53,181
They used the fire to see!
They used the fucking fire to see!

1695
01:51:53,183 --> 01:51:54,887
They can all do that. Let's tell them.

1696
01:51:55,752 --> 01:51:56,666
They already know.

1697
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:59,194
<i>We had a visual on Northeastern's landing.</i>
Listen.

1698
01:51:59,196 --> 01:52:01,279
<i>They were following
the fire trail in as a guide.</i>

1699
01:52:01,545 --> 01:52:03,089
<i>If they can do it, so can we!</i>

1700
01:52:21,826 --> 01:52:24,061
Any landing you can walk
away from is a good one.

1701
01:52:24,062 --> 01:52:24,778
That's great.

1702
01:52:54,359 --> 01:52:55,158
Jump!

1703
01:52:56,521 --> 01:52:57,183
Jump!

1704
01:52:58,523 --> 01:52:59,834
I got you!
Jump!

1705
01:53:29,144 --> 01:53:30,517
There you go. That's it.

1706
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,778
Holly!

1707
01:53:42,966 --> 01:53:45,589
Holly!

1708
01:53:46,468 --> 01:53:48,478
Holly!

1709
01:53:51,315 --> 01:53:53,329
Holly!

1710
01:53:56,475 --> 01:53:59,320
Holly!

1711
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:04,527
Holly!

1712
01:54:08,579 --> 01:54:11,056
Holly!

1713
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:16,662
Holly!

1714
01:54:19,078 --> 01:54:20,815
Come on!
We got you!

1715
01:54:23,132 --> 01:54:24,345
You're gonna be alright, ma'am.

1716
01:54:26,733 --> 01:54:27,796
Oh, God.

1717
01:54:28,153 --> 01:54:29,161
Oh, baby.

1718
01:54:29,533 --> 01:54:31,346
I thought I was never gonna
see you again.

1719
01:54:31,823 --> 01:54:33,552
That's what I thought about you.

1720
01:54:34,274 --> 01:54:35,690
I love you so much.

1721
01:54:39,995 --> 01:54:42,341
They told me there were
terrorists at the airport.

1722
01:54:42,886 --> 01:54:45,084
Yeah. I heard that too.

1723
01:54:53,597 --> 01:54:55,148
God, that's beautiful.

1724
01:54:55,854 --> 01:54:56,706
Yeah.

1725
01:54:58,910 --> 01:55:00,872
Yup, it sure is.

1726
01:55:03,248 --> 01:55:04,516
I love you so much.

1727
01:55:07,316 --> 01:55:08,311
Oh, John.

1728
01:55:09,813 --> 01:55:11,776
Why does this keep happening to us?

1729
01:55:17,878 --> 01:55:19,011
Let's go home.

1730
01:55:24,453 --> 01:55:26,161
Somebody help me, please!

1731
01:55:26,845 --> 01:55:28,937
Oh, honey, help me up here, please.

1732
01:55:29,307 --> 01:55:30,514
Asshole!

1733
01:55:33,739 --> 01:55:35,383
Hey, Officer! Hey!

1734
01:55:35,384 --> 01:55:37,772
Come on! Come on! Hey, hey!

1735
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:39,682
Hey! Hop on in there!

1736
01:55:39,684 --> 01:55:41,082
Get your missus in!

1737
01:55:41,355 --> 01:55:42,526
What do you say, Marv?

1738
01:55:43,197 --> 01:55:46,205
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
clean up this mess!

1739
01:55:54,009 --> 01:55:55,407
Hey, McClane!

1740
01:55:56,792 --> 01:55:59,466
You get this parking ticket
in front of my airport?

1741
01:56:01,202 --> 01:56:02,048
Yeah.

1742
01:56:03,090 --> 01:56:04,828
What the hell.

1743
01:56:05,219 --> 01:56:07,363
It's Christmas!

1744
01:56:12,180 --> 01:56:13,368
Take off, Marv!

1745
