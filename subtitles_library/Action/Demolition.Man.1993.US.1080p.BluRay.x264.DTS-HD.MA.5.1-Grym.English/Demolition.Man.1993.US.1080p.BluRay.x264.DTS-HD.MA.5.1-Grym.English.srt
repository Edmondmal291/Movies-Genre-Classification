1
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,143
Remember when they let airlines
land in this town?

2
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,272
Yeah. Well, I don't understand
where we're going...

3
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,315
...or why we're bothering anyhow.

4
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:08,027
- You're doing a good deed.
- Wanna give us a better reason?

5
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:12,156
A maniac hijacked a municipal bus
with 30 passengers on it.

6
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,702
I got a hunch where those passengers are
and who that maniac is.

7
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,328
You wanna share it with us?

8
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,582
Phoenix. Simon Phoenix.

9
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:00,330
Send a maniac to catch one.

10
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,125
Phoenix!

11
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,074
Don't move, Phoenix.

12
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,620
You're under arrest.

13
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,957
Ha-ha-ha. Arrest? Shit.

14
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:27,542
And you're trespassing.

15
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,586
Where are the passengers?

16
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,797
Oh, yes, the passengers.

17
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,465
Well, they're, uh....

18
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:36,801
Fuck you.

19
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:39,095
The passengers are gone. Ha-ha-ha.

20
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:43,224
See, I told the city, I said,
"Look, nobody comes down here."

21
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,101
Postmen figured it out...

22
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,602
...policemen figured it out.

23
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,523
But the goddamn bus drivers
just wouldn't listen.

24
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,817
Last time, Phoenix.

25
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,986
Where are the hostages?

26
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:58,114
To hell with the hostages.
This is between you and me.

27
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,994
- Yeah.
- What? What?

28
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,204
What you got, soldier boy?
Do something.

29
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,623
Go ahead. Ha-ha-ha.

30
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,126
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

31
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,089
Set your ass on fire.

32
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,021
Is it cold in here?

33
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,356
Or is it just me?

34
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:05,723
Where are they, Phoenix?

35
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:08,017
Now, where did I put them? Ha.

36
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:12,063
I swear, I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

37
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,857
I'll keep that in mind.

38
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,777
Damn it, John,
I'm tired of this Demolition Man shit.

39
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,821
You were not supposed
to come down here.

40
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:05,783
You were not supposed to attempt
the arrest of Phoenix singlehanded...

41
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,451
...or blow anything up!

42
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:10,580
It's not me. He dumped the gas
and rigged the place to blow.

43
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,248
You had nothing to do with it.

44
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,334
I know you've tried to nail
this psycho for two years.

45
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,130
But try remembering a thing called
official police procedure.

46
00:06:19,297 --> 00:06:20,923
- Where are the hostages?
- Not here.

47
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,885
- What do you mean?
- He must've stashed them someplace else.

48
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,970
Are you sure they weren't in there?

49
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:29,599
I did a thermo check and there was
eight of them, all part of his gang.

50
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,933
Wrong again!

51
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,561
- You got something to say?
- Ha-ha-ha.

52
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,479
- Get him out of here.
- Let's go.

53
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,023
Oh, you motherfucker.

54
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,609
You and I are gonna have
a nice long chat.

55
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,152
Captain! Captain!

56
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,780
Over here. There are bodies everywhere.

57
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,240
There must be 20 or 30.

58
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:47,575
They're everywhere.

59
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,913
See that? I told him.
He said he didn't care.

60
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:57,001
Oh, my God! How could you sacrifice
all those innocent people for little old me?

61
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,253
What kind of man are you?

62
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,465
We'll spend a lot of quality time together.
See you, sweetie!

63
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,425
Honey! Sugar!

64
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,845
You got a lawyer, you better call him.

65
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,030
John Spartan, you've done
great deeds for the city of Los Angeles.

66
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:11,409
So it is with some regret that I,
William Smithers...

67
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,620
...acting as assistant warden,
hereby carry out this sentence.

68
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,706
Skip it.

69
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,583
You've been sentenced to...

70
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,588
...70 years' sub-zero rehabilitation
in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

71
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,717
...for the involuntary manslaughter
of 30 innocent civilians.

72
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,385
Skip it.

73
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:32,888
You'll be placed in cryostasis
for the duration of your sentence...

74
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,517
...during which your behavior will be altered
through synaptic suggestion.

75
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:40,521
You'll be eligible for parole no earlier
than the year 2046.

76
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,740
I'm sorry, sergeant.

77
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,381
<i>All personnel...</i>

78
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,968
<i>...the next scheduled parole hearing</i>
<i>for prisoner Gilmour...</i>

79
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,305
<i>...will take place at 0715.</i>

80
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:06,268
<i>Warden William Smithers,</i>
<i>report to Level A conference room.</i>

81
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,692
Mellow greetings,
Warden William Smithers.

82
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,111
<i>Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.</i>

83
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,823
As it is a beautiful Monday morning...

84
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,618
...and as my duty log irrationally
requires it...

85
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,663
...I'm hereby querying you
on the prison population update.

86
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,498
Does the tedium continue?

87
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,334
Your questioning is as amusing
as it is irrelevant.

88
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,712
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.

89
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,882
<i>I find this lack of stimulus</i>
<i>to be truly disappointing.</i>

90
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,717
- Don't you think?
<i>- I try not to.</i>

91
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,220
<i>However, you're young.</i>
<i>Think all you want.</i>

92
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:44,348
<i>Things don't happen anymore.</i>
<i>We've taken care of all that.</i>

93
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,268
<i>I'll Fiber Op you back</i>
<i>after the parole hearings.</i>

94
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,895
<i>Have a peachy day, lieutenant. Be well.</i>

95
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,355
Be well.

96
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:52,773
<i>Vector 137.</i>

97
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,401
<i>Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard.</i>

98
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,827
<i>Retina coding accepted,</i>
<i>Warden William Smithers. Be well.</i>

99
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:06,036
Go on.

100
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,131
- Self-drive on.
<i>- Self-drive engaged.</i>

101
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:19,008
Huxley, Lenina coding on.

102
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,678
<i>No police presence</i>
<i>is requested in the city at this time.</i>

103
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:23,971
<i>Report to the station.</i>

104
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,932
Oh, boy, how exciting.

105
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,010
That's it.

106
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:06,805
Food, glorious food.
There'll be another one in 12 hours.

107
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,683
These assholes are nothing
if not predictable.

108
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,310
God, I love to hate this place.

109
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:15,189
- There's not enough of us, Friendly.
- That doesn't really matter anymore.

110
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:16,607
People are hungry.

111
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:18,859
We got nothing left to lose.

112
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:33,916
Greetings, Erwin.

113
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,251
Lovely Lenina.

114
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:41,757
Greetings, welcome to the emergency line
of the San Angeles Police Department.

115
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,718
If you'd prefer an automated response,
press 1 now.

116
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,595
Be well, lieutenant.

117
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:51,642
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

118
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,811
Let me guess, all is serene?

119
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,647
On the contrary,
it's been a horrific a.m.

120
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,441
Public buildings were defaced.

121
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,777
Walls smudged with...

122
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,487
...scandalous graffiti.

123
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,780
Really?

124
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,950
Brutal. Why wasn't there
an all-cars notified?

125
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:11,829
Because there was no need
to create widespread panic.

126
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,456
Lieutenant Huxley...

127
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:17,501
...I monitored your disheartening
and distressing comments...

128
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:19,461
...to the warden this morning.

129
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,965
Do you really long for
chaos and disharmony?

130
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:27,845
Your fascination with the 20th century
seems to be affecting your judgment.

131
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,141
You realize you're setting a bad example
for other officers and personnel.

132
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,977
Thank you for the attitude readjustment,
Chief Earle.

133
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,854
Info assimilated.

134
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:45,696
Sanctimonious asshole.

135
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,324
<i>Lenina Huxley,</i>
<i>you are fined one half credit...</i>

136
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,869
<i>...for a sotto voce violation</i>
<i>of the verbal morality statute.</i>

137
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,579
Thank you.

138
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,962
Phew, that was tense.

139
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:03,922
- That was tense?
- Yes.

140
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,175
Tell me, Garcia...

141
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:10,429
...don't you get bored code-tracing perps
who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

142
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,639
No, I find my job deeply fulfilling.

143
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:17,728
I just cannot get over the reality
of this office, Lenina Huxley.

144
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:19,813
You're still addicted
to the 20th century.

145
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:23,775
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.

146
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,111
Holy smokes!

147
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:30,282
Is there anything in this office which
doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

148
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,910
Only you, Alfredo Garcia.

149
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,330
Don't you ever want
something to happen?

150
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:38,373
Goodness, no.

151
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,418
I knew you were gonna say that.

152
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,006
What I wouldn't give for some action.

153
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,770
Mr. Simon Phoenix.

154
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:03,398
One of our first and most
illustrious members.

155
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:08,278
Allow me to welcome you
to your parole hearing.

156
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,280
Let's get this one over quick.

157
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,620
Twenty-nine years ago,
the parole system as you know it--

158
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,958
--was rendered obsolete.

00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,518
Save yourself.

316
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,645
Come on.

317
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:35,238
Stupid.

318
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:51,754
<i>Simon says, everybody stay!</i>

319
00:27:54,716 --> 00:28:00,013
<i>And the home of the brave</i>

320
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,848
<i>Play ball!</i>

321
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:12,317
We've lost every camera for six blocks.

322
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,112
Go to Century City, 1200 millimeters.

323
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,415
He's going for the vehicle's
battery coil.

324
00:28:27,582 --> 00:28:29,542
It's pure capacitance gel.

325
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,347
<i>The problem is not</i>
<i>the defacement of public buildings...</i>

326
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:46,517
<i>...or the noise pollution caused by</i>
<i>the exploding devices.</i>

327
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,686
Allow me to explain.

328
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,898
The real problem lies
in the man whose initials...

329
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,400
...mark the detonating graffiti...

330
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:57,570
...on the streets of our peaceful city.

331
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,615
The man behind the E.F.:

332
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,243
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

333
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,996
For a sadly extended period of time...

334
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:13,419
...we in San Angeles have been plagued by
a pack of subterranean hooligans.

335
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:16,547
You will come to know them as "scraps."

336
00:29:16,714 --> 00:29:20,301
Men and women who have left
the comfort of our society...

337
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,682
...only to spew hostility at the very bosom
that they have relinquished.

338
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,559
There was a time when we used
to look upon these scraps...

339
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:32,438
...as rather pathetic
and relatively harmless.

340
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,191
Now they have a leader.

341
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:41,739
Mr. Friendly seems relentless in his ambition
to infect our harmony with his venom.

342
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:45,868
He must, of course, be stopped.

343
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:49,539
This radical terrorist behavior,
led by Mr. Friendly...

344
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:52,166
...must not be allowed
to undermine our safety.

345
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,380
Safety above all.

346
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,925
I expect your trust,
confidence and certitude.

347
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,678
If you'll excuse me.

348
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:11,019
Dr. Cocteau, a CryoCon has effected
self-release from the penitentiary.

349
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:15,690
It's quite horrific.
MurderDeathKills, all categories of chaos.

350
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,526
Enhance your calm. Enhance your--

351
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,240
"Be well" them for me.

352
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,040
Get me Captain George Earle
immediately.

353
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,251
It was just....

354
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,712
I mean, it was so....

355
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,924
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

356
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,885
It was fun for him.

357
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:48,389
I want you to do everything in your power
to snare this agent of destruction.

358
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:50,350
You have my utmost confidence.

359
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,353
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

360
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:56,439
<i>Be well.</i>

361
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,446
"Utmost confidence."

362
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,282
"Everything in our power."

363
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,871
What else is there?

364
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,249
Zachary Lamb...

365
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:19,128
...how was the fiendish Simon Phoenix
apprehended back in the 20th?

366
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,964
Twelve-state manhunt.

367
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:24,467
Satellite surveillance.

368
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,720
A video bite on <i>Unsolved Mysteries.</i>

369
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,139
Heh, none of them worked.

370
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,475
In the end, it took just one man.

371
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,769
One cop.

372
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,938
John Spartan.

373
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,439
John Spartan?

374
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:39,982
That's right.

375
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:42,819
They called him the Demolition Man.

376
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:46,948
<i>Spartan file 98345, L.A.P.D.</i>

377
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:52,245
<i>Spartan file 98761C, L.A.P.D.</i>

378
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,041
Are you sure this is real life?

379
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,501
Barely.

380
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,169
Spartan is a legend.

381
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:04,507
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1000 arrests over three years.

382
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,676
All authentic criminals.

383
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,178
There was a lot more business back then.

384
00:32:09,387 --> 00:32:12,181
<i>How can you justify destroying</i>
<i>a $7-million mini mall...</i>

385
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:15,101
<i>...to rescue a girl whose ransom</i>
<i>is only $25,000?</i>

386
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,602
<i>Fuck you, lady.</i>

387
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,604
<i>Good answer.</i>

388
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,399
This is your recommendation?

389
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,860
The Demolition Man's an animal.

390
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:28,531
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.

391
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:32,201
He's a musclebound grotesque...

392
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,787
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

393
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,957
Simon Phoenix
is an old-fashioned criminal.

394
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:39,917
We need an old-fashioned cop.

395
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:10,323
<i>Cryo plugs 312 and 618 are</i>
<i>vacant and ready for routine inspection.</i>

396
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:18,247
Transporting cryoprisoner Spartan
to the MTL.

397
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:19,957
Got it. Okay.

398
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,344
<i>John Spartan, 5864.</i>

399
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:34,430
<i>Pulmonary activity approaching normal.</i>

400
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:38,059
<i>Body temperature, 63 percent and rising.</i>

401
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,103
<i>Biolink engaged.</i>

402
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:44,982
<i>Laser defibrillation sequence started.</i>

403
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:47,693
<i>Plasma transfer in 15 seconds.</i>

404
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,114
<i>Plasma transfer, 10 seconds...</i>

405
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,991
<i>...eight seconds...</i>

406
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,701
<i>...six seconds....</i>

407
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:59,789
<i>Plasma transfer complete.</i>

408
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,333
<i>MTL complete.</i>

409
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:24,855
Hunting down an escaped CryoCon...

410
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,400
...by releasing another one?

411
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:29,235
I am unconvinced.

412
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:31,821
This is within the powers of the police.

413
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:35,908
He can be released on limited parole
and reinstated to active duty.

414
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,911
It's not enough to collect the '90s,
you bring them back?

415
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:41,163
Dr. Cocteau said
everything within our power.

416
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,790
I can't think of a better idea.

417
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:45,418
That still doesn't mean it's a good one.

418
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,590
This man comes from a dissimilar
method of law enforcement.

419
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,634
I'm not sure he's any different
than Simon Phoenix himself.

420
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:54,885
Detective?

421
00:34:57,138 --> 00:35:01,017
Detective, I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

422
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,603
The year is 2032.

423
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:07,523
- The reason you have been released is--
- How long have I been under?

424
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:11,777
Thirty-six years.

425
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,782
I had a wife.

426
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,826
What happened to my wife?

427
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:24,457
Her light was extinguished
in the Big One of 2010.

428
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:30,546
Um, she died.

429
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,132
In an earthquake.

430
00:35:33,633 --> 00:35:35,301
The earthquake.

431
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,305
I had a daughter.

432
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,642
I made a promise.
What happened to her?

433
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:46,187
John Spartan,
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

434
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:49,148
We didn't thaw you out
for a family reunion.

435
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:53,569
Consider it fortunate the lieutenant
even bothered to do a probe on your wife.

436
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:56,238
This is about you
and the CryoCon Simon Phoenix.

437
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,823
What?

438
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,910
This morning, Simon Phoenix
escaped from this cryo facility.

439
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,829
We've had 11 MurderDeathKills so far.

440
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,833
You see, we have become
a society of peace...

441
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,794
...loving and understanding...

442
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,089
...and we are, quite frankly,
not equipped to deal with this.

443
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:17,218
There have been no deaths of unnatural
causes in San Angeles in 16 years.

444
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:18,511
Where?

445
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:23,015
The Santa Barbara-Los Angeles-San Diego
Metroplex merged in 2011.

446
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,685
You are in the center of
what used to be Los Angeles.

447
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:27,978
That's great.

448
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,608
- You, get me a Marlboro.
- Yes, of course. Right away.

449
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,528
What's a Marlboro?

450
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:37,863
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

451
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,825
Uh, smoking is not good for you.

452
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,869
It has been deemed that anything
not good for you is bad.

453
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:47,623
Hence, illegal.
Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat--

454
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,791
Are you shitting me?

455
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,169
<i>John Spartan,</i>
<i>you are fined one credit...</i>

456
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:54,797
<i>...for violation</i>
<i>of the verbal morality statute.</i>

457
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:55,965
What the hell is that?

458
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,719
<i>- You are fined one credit....</i>
- Bad language...

459
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:03,723
...chocolate, gasoline,
uneducational toys and anything spicy.

460
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:07,184
Abortion is illegal, but so is pregnancy
if you don't have a license.

461
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,519
Caveman...

462
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:11,772
...let's finish with all the Rip Van Winkle
and get moving.

463
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:14,275
A Mr. Phoenix
has risen from the ashes.

464
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:18,779
Uh-huh. I tracked that dirtbag
for two years...

465
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:23,242
...and when I finally bring him down,
you turn me into an ice cube for my trouble.

466
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,702
Thanks, but no, thanks.

467
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,247
The conditions of your parole
are full reinstatement into the S.A.P.D...

468
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:31,917
...and immediate assignment to
the apprehension of Simon Phoenix.

469
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,335
Or...

470
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,840
...you can go back into cryostasis.

471
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:41,010
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.

472
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:49,101
- Here you go.
- Will do.

473
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:52,104
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

474
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:54,982
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

475
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,234
Where's your John Spartan?

476
00:37:57,401 --> 00:38:00,362
He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.

477
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,822
Oh.

478
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:07,870
Sir, I formally convey my presence.

479
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,040
How you doing?

480
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,501
We are not used to
physical-contact greetings.

481
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,752
Oh, germs.

482
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:18,214
Look, I don't know if you guys know it...

483
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,342
...but you're out of toilet paper.

484
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,845
Did you say toilet paper?

485
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:30,684
Oh. They used handfuls of wadded paper
back in the 20th.

486
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:37,399
I'm happy that you're happy,
but in place of the toilet paper...

487
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,693
...you've got a shelf
with three seashells.

488
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,365
He doesn't know how to use
the three seashells.

489
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,246
I can see how that could be confusing.

490
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:52,540
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

491
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,753
No. Zach?

492
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,964
Zach Lamb?

493
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,216
What happened to you?

494
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,094
Ha-ha-ha. I got older.

495
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:10,182
My God, I remember when you were
a snot-nosed rookie pilot.

496
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,226
They finally grounded me.

497
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:14,478
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

498
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:20,192
<i>You are fined two credits for</i>
<i>violation of the verbal morality statute.</i>

499
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:22,444
I'll be right back.

500
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:26,156
They seem to be friends, yet he speaks
to him in the most profane manner.

501
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:31,453
If you'd read my study, you'd know this is
how insecure heterosexual males bonded.

502
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,830
I knew that.

503
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,208
Thanks a lot, you shit-brained,
fuck-faced, ball-breaking...

504
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,796
- ...duck-fucking pain in the ass.
<i>- You're fined five credits...</i>

505
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,632
<i>...for repeated violations</i>
<i>of the verbal morality statute.</i>

506
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,050
So much for the seashells.

507
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,846
See you in a few minutes.

508
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:54,852
<i>Waiting for command.</i>
<i>Voice check, Lenina Huxley.</i>

509
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:57,688
Unfortunately
Simon Phoenix was not coded.

510
00:39:57,855 --> 00:40:00,482
While you were sleeping,
everyone was installed code.

511
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:04,612
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau
that an organic microchip...

512
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,155
...be sewn into the skin.

513
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,283
Sensors all over the city can zero in
on anyone at any time.

514
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,329
I can't even conceive what you
police officers did before it was developed.

515
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:16,707
We worked for a living.
This fascist crap makes me wanna puke.

516
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,418
What do you think you're scratching,
caveman?

517
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,837
You really think we'd let you go
without control?

518
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:25,007
Your code was implanted
the second you thawed.

519
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:26,926
Why not just shove a leash up my ass?

520
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,262
- You dirty meat-eater!
<i>- You are fined....</i>

521
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:32,348
No matter how Viking your era was...

522
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,559
...I cannot digest how
you ever wore a badge.

523
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:38,646
You're going back, John Spartan.
Oh, yes, you're going back.

524
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:41,649
Could you two please
dump some hormones?

525
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,943
We need every cortex we can get here.

526
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,986
We don't need the Neanderthal.

527
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,697
Our computer has already
examined every scenario...

528
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,533
...resulting from the appearance
of Simon Phoenix.

529
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,537
It is determined he'll attempt to set up
a new drug lab and form a crime syndicate.

530
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,123
<i>That is correct, Chief George Earle.</i>

531
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:01,502
I hate to interrupt you two lovebirds,
but that's really fucking stupid.

532
00:41:02,878 --> 00:41:04,463
You think he wants to start a business?

533
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,425
Phoenix is going for a gun,
plain and simple.

534
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:11,845
Trust me. He's going for a gun.

535
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,639
Who cares what this primate thinks?

536
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,058
Resonate some understanding.

537
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:20,229
The only place a person
can even view a gun in this city...

538
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,356
...is at a museum.

539
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:31,991
<i>Welcome to the San Angeles</i>
<i>Museum of History.</i>

540

- Hey, hey! All right.

542
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,082
<i>- ...in downtown Los Angeles...</i>
- Now, good.

00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,886

<i>of the primitive behavior prevalent...</i>

549
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:04,273
<i>...during the late 20th century.</i>

550
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,900
Home, sweet home.

551
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:08,777
Ooh.

552
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:12,322
John Spartan,
even if Simon Phoenix was able...

553
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:14,450
...to locate the cache of firearms...

554
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:16,785
...it would be impossible to remove them.

555
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:20,539
She's right. They're located
in a maximum-security exhibit.

556
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:23,125
It's just a hunch. So trust me on this.

557
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:24,710
It's a cop thing.

558
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:26,503
And what am I, a frog?

559
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,299
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

560
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:31,467
I'll drive.

561
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,302
I see.

562
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:39,183
<i>Resetting all bio-links for new driver.</i>

00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,527

<i>Welcome, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.</i>

568
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,924
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan...

569
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,176
...but things aren't all that different.

570
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:16,470
Perhaps you'd like to hear
an oldies station?

571
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,350
This is the town's most popular station.

572
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:24,103
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials."

How do you get in here?

593
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:31,086
Hey, hey. I gotta wait that 15-day

00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:46,226
Mellow greetings.
What seems to be your boggle?

597
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,187
My boggle?

598

Where are all the phaser guns?

605
00:45:21,637 --> 00:45:22,971
Ah.

00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,432
Mellow greetings, sir.

do you find batteries in the future?

616

Patience is not one of my virtues.

What?

625
00:46:32,207 --> 00:46:35,127
Never mind. I give up trying

00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:48,223
<i>Establish</i>
<i>communication with maniac intruder.</i>

629
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,474
Wrong.

630
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,728
- Luke Skywalker, use the Force.
- Oh, dear.

631
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:55,897
- What the hell is this?
- It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

632
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:58,358
- Does it work?
- Well, um--

633
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:02,612
Guess so.

634
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,323
He's trapped in section 8.

635
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:06,658
I doubt it. Make sure that building's clear.

636
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:08,410
Done. I want a visual.

637
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:11,580
Every corridor of the museum.
I want full sensors routed to me...

638
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,540
- ...and I want it 90 seconds ago.
- Hmm.

639
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,502
You guys wait here. Give me 10 minutes.

640
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:23,258
<i>Patron, you are now</i>
<i>confined to the armory.</i>

641
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:29,139
<i>Museum patron, you are now</i>
<i>confined to the armory.</i>

642
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:37,272
<i>The armory exhibit is now sealed.</i>

643
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:42,611
<i>All museum patrons still occupying</i>
<i>the facility should remain calm.</i>

644
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,279
<i>Help is imminent.</i>

645
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:50,160
This museum is no longer sealed, is it?

646
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,289
What can I say?
I'm a blast from the past.

647
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:55,999
You should've stayed there.

648
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:58,460
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

649
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,466
Bad aim, blondie.

650
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,468
Spartan? John Spartan?

651
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:09,763
Aw, shit, they let anybody into this century.
What are you doing here?

652
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:14,851
Simon says, bleed!

653
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,689
Great. Just great.

654
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:21,650
You're making it too easy for me.

655
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:23,568
Come on, you space-age piece of shit.

656
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,321
Let me get this right.

657
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:31,159
They defrosted you just so you could lasso
my piddly ass? Damn, you been had.

658
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,579
I've been dreaming about killing you
for 40 years.

659
00:48:36,498 --> 00:48:38,375
Yeah? Well, keep dreaming.

660
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,448
Ooh, wow!

661
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,122
Oh, shit!

662
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:39,895
<i>Acc-Mag now reactivated.</i>

663
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,229
It's about time.

664
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,733
Past is over, John.
Time for something new and improved.

665
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,485
Oh, hell.

666
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:53,283
Holy shit! I love this gun! Goddamn!

667
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:02,000
How do you like me in the future,
John, huh?

668
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:14,804
Come on, Phoenix. Come on!

669
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,522
That must have hurt.

670
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,316
Huh, soldier boy? Ha-ha-ha.

671
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:28,068
- You're on TV.
- Oh, shit!

672
00:50:36,493 --> 00:50:37,619
You're dead.

673
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:39,829
Forgot to say, "Simon says."

674
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:45,669
Oh, shit.

675
00:50:45,835 --> 00:50:47,128
Good one.

676
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:52,384
Such a brave new world.
Sorry you gotta go.

677
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:53,927
Shit.

678
00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:27,669
Our noble facility has been
desecrated by hooligans.

679
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,463
Someone will pay dearly for this.

680
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:37,762
Sir, the stress breeder is inside
being demobilized as we speak.

681
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:44,561
Shit. Being frozen
must have thrown my aim off.

682
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:47,188
Don't worry,
I'll get you with the next shot.

683
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,525
I don't think so.

684
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:55,697
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

685
00:51:56,364 --> 00:51:59,200
And you were doing so well.

686
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:02,037
Now, don't you have a job to do? Hmm?

687
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:06,541
Isn't there a thought repeating
in that barbaric brain of yours?

688
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,460
The name Friendly.

689
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:10,253
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

690
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,381
Don't you have someone to kill?

691
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:24,059
- Yeah, I do.
- Excellent.

692
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:26,061
Then go and do your job.

693
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:27,979
Phoenix!

694
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:32,067
Shit. Saved by the bell.

695
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:39,449
Shit.

696
00:52:48,667 --> 00:52:49,834
Damn.

697
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:53,963
You're lucky he didn't whack you.

698
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:59,678
I must say that whacking, whatever it is,
sounds most disagreeable. Heh, heh.

699
00:52:59,928 --> 00:53:01,721
Well, you scared him away.

700
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,516
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

701
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:06,518
No problem.

702
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:11,147
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

703
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:14,401
Simon Phoenix knows
he has some competition.

704
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,778
He's finally matched his meat.

705
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:19,364
You really licked his ass.

706
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:23,993
That's "met his match"
and "kicked his ass."

707
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,706
Met? "Met his match
and kicked his ass."

708
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,624
Captain Earle.

709
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,210
Who is this man?

710
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,715
John Spartan, temporarily reinstated
to the San Angeles Police Department...

711
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,800
...to pursue the CryoCon Simon Phoenix.

712
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:43,847
You told us to do everything
in our power to capture him.

713
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,349
Oh, yes. Yes, I did. I did.

714
00:53:46,683 --> 00:53:49,269
Yes, I do recall the exploits of
Mr. John Spartan.

715
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:54,065
Yes. Didn't they call him--?
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.

716
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:55,942
It's quite all right, chief.

717
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,361
Unexpected. Creative.

718
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:00,864
But quite all right.

719
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,324
John Spartan, welcome.

720
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,329
Now, in honor of your arrival and your
protection of the sanctity of human life...

721
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,831
...namely my own, ha, ha...

722
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:12,876
...I would like to invite you to join me
to dinner tonight.

723
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,085
The both of you.

724
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:15,837
Please, I insist.

725
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:18,173
I would like you to accompany me...

726
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:19,591
...to Taco Bell.

727
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,804
Look forward to it. Thank you.

728
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,521
- Taco Bell?
- Yes.

729
00:54:36,524 --> 00:54:38,359
So let me get this right:

730
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:41,863
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now
the man in charge, the mayor/gov...

731
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,574
...who wants to take me to dinner
at Taco Bell--

732
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:46,159
Though I wouldn't mind a burrito.

733
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:47,744
--also built the goddamn cryoprison?

734
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,206
<i>- John Spartan, you are fined one credit....</i>
- Thanks.

735
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,334
Dr. Cocteau is the most important
man in San Angeles.

736
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:58,129
He practically created
our whole way of life, savage.

737
00:54:58,296 --> 00:54:59,672
Yeah? Well, he can have it.

738
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:04,886
Phoenix could be anywhere,
but not being coded could limit him.

739
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:08,598
Correct. Money is outmoded.
All transactions are through codes.

740
00:55:08,765 --> 00:55:11,851
So he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

741
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:14,687
It'd be a waste of time to mug somebody.

742
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,732
Unless he rips off someone's hand.

743
00:55:17,899 --> 00:55:20,693
But with all officers patrolling
in a citywide crisis net...

744
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,862
...should be a matter of tick-tocks
before--

745
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:26,574
More importantly,
we already have a backup plan.

746
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:30,620
We can just wait
for another code to go red.

747
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:33,498
When Phoenix performs another
MurderDeathKill...

748
00:55:33,665 --> 00:55:36,668
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

749
00:55:36,918 --> 00:55:38,586
- Great plan.
- Thank you.

750
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,547
He likes your plan, chief.

751
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:48,429
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades
for quite some time.

752
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:53,226
In fact, I perused some newsreels from
the Schwarzenegger Library. That time--

753
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:54,477
Hold it.

754
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:56,604
The Schwarzenegger Library?

755
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:59,607
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.

756
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,276
Wasn't he an actor when--?

757
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:03,403
- Stop. He was president?
- Yes.

758
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:08,449
Even though he wasn't a native,
his popularity caused the 61st Amendment--

759
00:56:08,616 --> 00:56:10,535
I don't want to know.

760
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:13,955
President.

761
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:25,550
What the hell is this?
No door? No welcome mat?

762
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,971
What is this?

763
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,642
What kind of people are these?
How do they expect you to kill somebody?

764
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:41,232
Oh, shit, I love that smell.
Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.

765
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,818
All right. A job is a job.

766
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,991
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are,
prepare for Simon Phoenix.

767
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:54,704
So, what's with this Cocteau guy
anyway?

768
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:57,248
He says I saved his life,
which I'm not sure I did.

769
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:59,792
My reward is dinner and dancing
at Taco Bell?

770
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:04,047
I mean, hey, I like Mexican food,
but come on.

771
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:06,758
Your tone is quasi-facetious,
but you do not realize...

772
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:10,178
...Taco Bell was the only restaurant
to survive the Franchise Wars.

773
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:11,512
So?

774
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,973
So now all restaurants are Taco Bell.

775
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:17,727
No way.

776
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:29,197
Welcome to Taco Bell.

777
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,282
Enjoy your meal, sir.

778
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:36,412
<i>Valley of the Jolly Green Giant</i>

779
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,583
<i>Good things from the garden</i>

780
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:44,045
<i>Garden in the valley</i>
<i>Valley of the Jolly Green Giant</i>

781
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:46,214
Be well.

782
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:47,382
I'll take that.

783
00:57:48,091 --> 00:57:50,802
Oh. Here comes the Neanderthal.

784
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:54,389
Mr. Spartan, over there, please,
and lieutenant....

785
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:56,474
Thank you. Would you...?

786
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,559
- Yes.
- Hi.

787
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,728
- How are you guys doing?
- Mellow, thank you.

788
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:02,939
Fine. Yes.

789
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:04,941
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

790
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,110
Good thing I'm hungry.

791
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:10,446
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask you
to raise your glasses...

792
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:13,741
...to the hero of the hour, my savior...

793
00:58:13,908 --> 00:58:15,827
...Detective John Spartan.

794
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:17,954
John Spartan.

795
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,664
Appreciate it.

796
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:24,544
Greetings and salutations.

797
00:58:24,711 --> 00:58:26,212
I'm Associate Bob.

798
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:30,842
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was groveling in fear at the time.

799
00:58:31,384 --> 00:58:33,261
You got the salt over there, Bob?

800
00:58:34,095 --> 00:58:37,265
Um, salt is not good for you,
hence it is ille--

801
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:40,101
So, John Spartan, tell me...

802
00:58:40,268 --> 00:58:43,688
...what do you think of
San Angeles, 2032?

803
00:58:43,855 --> 00:58:46,399
Considering the way things were going
when I went in...

804
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,985
...I thought the future would be
a writhing cesspool.

805
00:58:49,235 --> 00:58:52,321
You weren't here
when the real disturbances began.

806
00:58:52,488 --> 00:58:55,116
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

807
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:58,745
The city degenerated
into a total fear zone.

808
00:58:59,412 --> 00:59:03,416
The citizenry at home, afraid to go out.
People just wanted the madness over.

809
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:08,880
So when I saw the chance
to make things right, I seized it.

810
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:14,927
If I had not, the radiance of San Angeles
would not be here.

811
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:19,766
Just your rotting cesspool of hate
and suffering. Which would you prefer?

812
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:23,770
Can you book me a flight out of here
when the sermon's over?

813
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:25,229
John Spartan...

814
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:29,859
...for your crimes, you would surely
have died in jail before now.

815
00:59:30,276 --> 00:59:34,572
Even you must appreciate
the persuasively tranquil humanity...

816
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:37,158
...of the cryoprison system.

817
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:42,705
I don't want to spoil your dinner, pal,
but my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.

818
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:44,957
I had feelings and I had thoughts.

819
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:48,377
A 36-year nightmare about people
caught in a burning building.

820
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:50,963
You were awake? I don't think so.

821
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:52,340
I do think so.

822
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:56,427
My wife beating her fists against
a block of ice that was her husband.

823
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:58,763
You were nice enough to wake me up...

824
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,141
...let me know everything that meant
something in my life is gone.

825
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:05,394
Would have been more humane to stake me
down and leave me to the fucking crows.

826
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:10,399
What would you say if I called you
a brutish fossil...

827
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:14,403
...symbolic of a decayed era
gratefully forgotten?

828
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:16,906
I don't know. "Thanks"?

829
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:22,036
I thought during rehabilitation,
the prisoners were not conscious.

830
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:24,080
A person would go insane.

831
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:27,875
The side effects
of the cryo process are unavoidable.

832
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:29,544
You were found guilty of a crime.

833
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,796
You owed and still owe
a debt to society.

834
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,257
- There's nothing I can do.
- Yeah, there is.

835
01:00:34,423 --> 01:00:37,969
- Call for backup. I'll be across the street.
- Where are you going?

836
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:41,639
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one of those hunches.

837
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:03,953
- Come on.
- Go for the truck.

838
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,663
The food's in the truck.

839
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:10,126
Grab the big bottle. Move, move, move.

840
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:25,433
You'll regret this the rest of your life.
Both seconds of it.

841
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:31,731
Good night.

842
01:01:41,949 --> 01:01:43,117
Get him!

843
01:02:00,927 --> 01:02:03,179
What a fucking hero. Come on.

844
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:13,898
Please, don't.

845
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:21,948
What the hell?

846
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,033
Such reckless abandonment.

847
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,118
Looks like there's
a new shepherd in town.

848
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:28,913
That's "sheriff." Who were those guys?

849
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,374
They're known as scraps.

850
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,085
Outcasts and deserters who choose
to live beneath us...

851
01:02:34,252 --> 01:02:36,754
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

852
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:41,133
They're a constant irritation
to our harmony.

853
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,261
They're nothing but thugs
and hooligans.

854
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:47,515
A society of thieves. The last remaining
criminal element in the city.

855
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:51,102
But plans are in progress
to purge this peril from our day.

856
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,021
You are even better live
than on LaserDisc.

857
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:57,275
The way you paused to make
a glib witticism before doing battle...

858
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,402
...with that scrap, and those punches--

859
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:01,821
This isn't the Wild West, okay?

860
01:03:01,988 --> 01:03:04,031
The Wild West wasn't even
the Wild West.

861
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:06,367
Hurting people's not a good thing.

862
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:10,121
Well, sometimes it is, but not when
it's people looking for something to eat.

863
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:22,341
<i>San Angeles time is now 2215.</i>

864
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:23,759
Huxley coding off.

865
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,219
Auto-drive.

866
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:28,055
<i>Auto-drive engaged.</i>

867
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,645
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you back there.

868
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,983
No need to make a de-hurtful retraction.

869
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,861
I've just assimilated
too much contraband.

870
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:45,865
I fleshed you out as some "blow up the bad
guy with a happy grin" he-man type.

871
01:03:46,407 --> 01:03:49,577
But now I realize that you're
the "moody troubled-past gunslinger...

872
01:03:49,744 --> 01:03:51,620
...who will only draw when he must"
type.

873
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:53,622
- Huxley, stop.
- What?

874
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:56,125
I just do my job and things get--

875
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:57,835
Demolished.

876
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:08,637
I look around and I think of my daughter
growing up in a place like this.

877
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:11,307
I'm afraid she's gonna think
I'm a primitive.

878
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:14,602
As much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.

879
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,605
Because I don't think I'll fit in
to the picture very well.

880
01:04:17,772 --> 01:04:18,856
Not very well at all.

881
01:04:21,484 --> 01:04:25,196
It would be a misuse of police powers,
but I can do a search for you.

882
01:04:25,363 --> 01:04:26,781
No.

883
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:32,411
Sorry.

884
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:39,001
Subject change. I got what you wanted.

885
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:40,211
Oh, great.

886
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:46,217
What do you need that for?

887
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:49,303
It's just one of those cop hunches again.

888
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,398
Lights.

889
01:05:00,648 --> 01:05:03,317
No. I've changed that.

890
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,569
Illuminate.

891
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,406
Deluminate.

892
01:05:11,117 --> 01:05:13,285
Hoo! Isn't that nicer?

893
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:14,829
Go ahead, you try it.

894
01:05:16,497 --> 01:05:17,998
Illuminate.

895
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:23,754
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.

896
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,506
How did you get in?

897
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,551
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

898
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:30,428
Routes to underground kingdoms.

899
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:34,390
Complete access to the industrial
data-grid interface.

900
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,100
I don't even know
what that shit means.

901
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:39,437
I've been meaning to ask you,
because I like it.

902
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,272
I like it a lot.

903
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:45,776
Your skills have been given to you
for a reason.

904
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:48,446
Not for your personal amusement.

905
01:05:48,696 --> 01:05:53,534
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly
and stop a revolution before it precipitates.

906
01:05:53,701 --> 01:05:56,954
That was why you were rehabilitated.

907
01:05:59,206 --> 01:06:02,585
All right. I'm gonna do
your little dastardly deed for you.

908
01:06:03,711 --> 01:06:06,881
But it's gonna be a little bit more
difficult than you thought.

909
01:06:07,047 --> 01:06:09,341
And I'm gonna need some help.

910
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:13,095
I'll need about five or six more
special men.

911
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,515
And I just so happen to have a list.

912
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:20,436
I wouldn't want you to defrost any of
those killer types, know what I mean?

913
01:06:20,603 --> 01:06:24,190
And none of those motherfuckers from
New York. They're too uptight.

914
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:27,776
So you're going to be
the only killer type, right?

915
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:30,279
<i>Exactamundo.</i>

916
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:33,073
Fine.

917
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:35,284
Take care of it.

918
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,412
Just get it over with.

919
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:40,789
You're more trouble than you're worth.

920
01:06:41,332 --> 01:06:44,460
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

921
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:48,172
And what do I get out of all this?

922
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:51,800
What do you want?

923
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:54,011
Malibu.

924
01:06:54,512 --> 01:06:59,433
Santa Monica. Hell, what about
all the coastal cities? Ha-ha-ha.

925
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,268
Well, I'll bear it in mind.

926
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:04,980
- Good, I'll send you a memo.
- Just do your job!

927
01:07:09,276 --> 01:07:13,322
What is John Spartan doing here? Huh?

928
01:07:13,489 --> 01:07:15,950
Did you invite him
to this little party of ours?

929
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:21,830
Look, you finish your business
and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

930
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:23,958
Think of him as a guarantee.

931
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:26,043
A guarantee?

932
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,046
You don't have much of a guarantee.

933
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:32,424
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.

934
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,639
Now we need those men defrosted.

935
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,979
So this is where you live?

936
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:46,564
Very not bad.

937
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,023
Thank you.

938
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:50,276
So where will I be staying?

939
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:53,988
I've procured you a domicile
right down the corridor from my own.

940
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,578
Everything is voice coded,
so if you need something, just ask.

941
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,162
Lights.

942
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:04,582
What do you think?

943
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:09,336
Clicked off a lot of credits
to create a 20th-century apartment.

944
01:08:09,503 --> 01:08:10,838
Huxley, it's very....

945
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:12,631
- Isn't it?
- Ha-ha-ha.

946
01:08:14,925 --> 01:08:16,343
John Spartan...

947
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:21,015
...there is, of course, a well-known
and documented connection...

948
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:24,268
...between sex and violence.

949
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:30,441
Not so much a causal effect,
but a general state of neurological arousal.

950
01:08:30,608 --> 01:08:36,614
And after having observed
your behavior this evening...

951
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,408
...and my resultant condition...

952
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:41,493
...um...

953
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:44,663
...I was wondering
if you would like to have sex.

954
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:52,254
- With you?
- Mm-hm.

955
01:08:54,214 --> 01:08:58,218
- Here? Heh, heh. Now?
- Mm-hm.

956
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:01,305
Oh, yeah.

957
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:03,932
Great! Ha, ha.

958
01:09:05,476 --> 01:09:06,810
I'll be right back.

959
01:09:24,495 --> 01:09:25,913
<i>Love Boat?</i>

960
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:30,959
Okay.

961
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:46,809
There you go.

962
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:56,193
Now, just relax.
We'll begin in a few seconds.

963
01:09:56,694 --> 01:09:58,320
Begin what?

964
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:00,614
Having sex, of course.

965
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:54,918
<i>Yes. Yes. Yes!</i>

966
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:01,008
What's wrong? You broke contact.

967
01:11:01,175 --> 01:11:03,051
Contact? I didn't even touch you yet.

968
01:11:03,594 --> 01:11:05,846
But I thought you wanted to make love.

969
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,306
Is that what you call this?

970
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:14,605
Vir-sex produces high alpha waves
during transference of sexual energies.

971
01:11:14,772 --> 01:11:17,232
Huxley, let's do it the old-fashioned way.

972
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,610
Ew! Disgusting!

973
01:11:19,777 --> 01:11:20,861
You mean...

974
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:22,696
...fluid transfer?

975
01:11:22,863 --> 01:11:27,117
No, I mean boning, the wild mambo,
the hunka-chunka.

976
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:28,952
That is no longer done.

977
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,872
Exchange of bodily fluids,
know what that leads to?

978
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:35,042
Yeah, I do.
Kids, smoking, a desire to raid the fridge.

979
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:38,212
Rampant exchange of bodily fluids
was one of the major reasons...

980
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,214
...for the downfall of society.

981
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:44,134
After AIDS, there was NRS.
After NRS, there was UBT.

982
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:47,179
One of the first things Dr. Cocteau did
was to outlaw...

983
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:51,350
...and engineer all fluid transfer
out of societally acceptable behavior.

984
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:54,436
Not even mouth transfer is condoned.

985
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:55,729
- Kissing's not allowed?
- Ugh!

986
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,439
Damn, I was a good kisser.

987
01:11:59,399 --> 01:12:01,151
What about kids?

988
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:02,903
- Procreation?
- Yeah.

989
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:04,571
We go to a lab.

990
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:06,824
Fluids are purified, screened...

991
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,244
...and transferred by authorized
medical personnel only.

992
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,329
It is the only legal way.

993
01:12:15,624 --> 01:12:17,084
What are you doing?

994
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:19,586
Breaking the law.

995
01:12:21,171 --> 01:12:23,590
You are a savage creature, John Spartan.

996
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:26,844
I wish you to leave my domicile now.

997
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,184
Look, you know--

998
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:57,958
<i>Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.</i>

999
01:13:07,467 --> 01:13:08,802
Lights.

1000
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,406
"He doesn't know how to use
the three seashells."

1001
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:37,915
Happy Halloween.

1002
01:14:09,363 --> 01:14:11,615
"Behavioral engineering"?

1003
01:14:12,407 --> 01:14:16,912
<i>Hi, Martin, I was thinking--</i>
<i>Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.</i>

1004
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:32,052
<i>Our noble facility</i>
<i>has been desecrated by hooligans.</i>

1005
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:35,639
<i>Someone will pay dearly for this.</i>

1006
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:42,896
<i>Sir, the stress breeder is inside</i>
<i>being demobilized as we speak.</i>

1007
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:46,566
<i>Shit. Being frozen</i>
<i>must have thrown my aim off.</i>

1008
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:48,986
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>I'll get you with the next shot.</i>

1009
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:50,737
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1010
01:14:51,405 --> 01:14:53,740
<i>No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.</i>

1011
01:15:05,585 --> 01:15:08,922
- Detective.
- Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

1012
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:12,342
Here, I made this for you.

1013
01:15:16,304 --> 01:15:18,223
- For me?
- Yeah.

1014
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:21,184
Thank you.

1015
01:15:24,396 --> 01:15:25,897
Oh, I'll drive.

1016
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:29,359
- I gotta learn to do this once in my life.
- Okay.

1017
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,583
Thank you for the lovely gift.

1018
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,294
I don't know what you guys put into
my cryo sludge.

1019
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:50,047
When I thawed out,
first thing I wanted to do was knit.

1020
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:55,135
How come I know what a zipperfoot,
a shuttle, a bobbin and a petit point is?

1021
01:15:55,302 --> 01:15:57,721
I could weave a throw rug right now
with my eyes closed.

1022
01:15:57,888 --> 01:16:00,265
Ha, ha. It's part of your rehab program.

1023
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,310
For each inmate, the computer
draws up a skill or trade...

1024
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:05,312
...suited to their genetic disposition.

1025
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:07,856
And it would implant the knowledge
and the desire...

1026
01:16:08,023 --> 01:16:10,317
...to carry out whatever training
was assigned.

1027
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:13,445
I'm a seamstress?

1028
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:15,489
Oh, that's just great.

1029
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:18,075
I come out of cryoprison
and I'm Betsy fucking Ross.

1030
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:20,660
Phoenix can access computers,
operate all vehicles...

1031
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,954
...knows the location of everything
in town...

1032
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:25,123
...and is stronger than when he went in?

1033
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:31,004
- Can you get me his rehab program now?
- Sure.

1034
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,134
- I'm a seamstress.
- Access code for Simon Phoenix.

1035
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,428
<i>Access Simon Phoenix.</i>

1036
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:40,263
<i>Accessing.</i>

1037
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:42,724
<i>Access denied.</i>

1038
01:16:44,017 --> 01:16:45,769
- What?
<i>- Security override.</i>

1039
01:16:45,936 --> 01:16:47,270
This can't be right.

1040
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:53,276
<i>Access granted, Officer Huxley.</i>

1041
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:58,240
<i>Accessing Simon Phoenix,</i>
<i>Deepfile rehab 65-R.</i>

1042
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:02,327
<i>Urban Combatkill. Torture Methodology.</i>
<i>Computer Override Authority.</i>

1043
01:17:02,494 --> 01:17:03,912
There must be some mistake.

1044
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,499
<i>Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.</i>
<i>Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.</i>

1045
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,835
<i>Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior.</i>

1046
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,921
- This isn't a rehab program.
- No kidding.

1047
01:17:13,088 --> 01:17:14,422
This would create a monster.

1048
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:18,260
- Who develops these programs?
- Cocteau Industries, of course.

1049
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:23,807
But why would the benevolent Dr. Cocteau
send such a brute savage into our midst?

1050
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:25,767
Good question. Let's go ask him.

1051
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:28,186
No. You do not accuse a savior
of our city...

1052
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:32,607
...of being connected with a
multi-MurderDeathKiller like Phoenix. It's...

1053
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:34,734
...rude.

1054
01:17:35,235 --> 01:17:36,653
I'll be subtle.

1055
01:17:37,988 --> 01:17:39,114
I'm good at subtle.

1056
01:17:41,575 --> 01:17:43,160
<i>Mellow greetings.</i>

1057
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:47,747
<i>We are happy to welcome you to the</i>
<i>Cocteau Behavioral Engineering Complex.</i>

1058
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:48,999
<i>Be well.</i>

1059
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:51,042
- Enhance your calm, John Spartan.
- Mm.

1060
01:17:56,464 --> 01:18:00,218
<i>Mellow apologies for my lack</i>
<i>of physical disposition, detective...</i>

1061
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:02,053
<i>...but I have a city/gov to run.</i>

1062
01:18:02,596 --> 01:18:04,139
Well, run this.

1063
01:18:04,306 --> 01:18:07,767
You programmed Phoenix's rehab
to turn him into a terrorist.

1064
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:10,228
And I don't think
his escape was an accident.

1065
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,105
- Very subtle.
- Thank you.

1066
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:15,942
Outside the museum, why didn't he blow
your brains out? What did you say to him?

1067
01:18:16,109 --> 01:18:18,528
<i>I honestly don't remember.</i>
<i>Does it matter?</i>

1068
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:20,614
It matters. I saw the security disk.

1069
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:24,034
He had 10 seconds to figure out
where to put the hole in your fucking head.

1070
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:29,748
<i>This display of barbaric behavior</i>
<i>was unacceptable even in your time.</i>

1071
01:18:29,915 --> 01:18:33,168
Yeah. But it worked.

1072
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:40,091
When a man like Phoenix
has a gun to your head...

1073
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:43,094
...10 seconds is 9 and a half seconds
longer than you live.

1074
01:18:44,054 --> 01:18:48,808
<i>Not everyone is as eager as you to resort</i>
<i>to violence to solve life's difficulties.</i>

1075
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:52,604
<i>Even now, I'm beginning to wonder</i>
<i>if the chaos in the museum...</i>

1076
01:18:52,771 --> 01:18:56,233
<i>...was the result of Mr. Phoenix's</i>
<i>presence or your own.</i>

1077
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:58,401
Wonder about this, shithead.

1078
01:18:59,778 --> 01:19:04,366
If you think you got this maniac under
control, trust me, you don't.

1079
01:19:04,532 --> 01:19:08,119
Is there something specific you plan
to do with that archaic device?

1080
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:09,955
John Spartan.

1081
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:13,833
No, I didn't think so.

1082
01:19:14,376 --> 01:19:18,797
Detective, the only thing I haven't got
under control is you.

1083
01:19:18,964 --> 01:19:20,966
But that can be solved.

1084
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:23,510
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.

1085
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:26,263
Your family's dead, your past is dead.

1086
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,723
Dead things cannot affect the living.

1087
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:33,061
So enjoy your moment of
prehistoric bravado...

1088
01:19:33,228 --> 01:19:35,939
...because after you leave here,
it will be over.

1089
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:38,775
Like everything else in your life.

1090
01:19:38,984 --> 01:19:42,529
Officer, return this man
to cryostasis immediately.

1091
01:19:42,696 --> 01:19:43,697
Be well.

1092
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,449
Be fucked.

1093
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:49,077
<i>You are fined one--</i>

1094
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:58,670
<i>Greetings, citizen.</i>
<i>How are you on this glorious day?</i>

1095
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:00,964
- I'll wait here.
- Let's go.

1096
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:03,842
- I don't know.
- I do know. Turn that thing on.

1097
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:07,053
- I hope you know what you're doing.
<i>- Vector, 23 degrees.</i>

1098
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:11,349
You're asking me to disobey a direct order.
I'm to escort you to the cryoprison.

1099
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:15,770
Do what you got to. I gotta nail that maniac
and put him on ice or that's where I'll be.

1100
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:18,732
- Enhance your calm.
- I've had it with enhancing my calm.

1101
01:20:18,898 --> 01:20:21,067
I'm gonna find that psycho
and enhance his calm.

1102
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:24,946
When I'm done, I'm gonna turn all
my attention to that Froot Loop, Cocteau.

1103
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:27,699
You don't have to come with me.
I'll do it alone. Okay?

1104
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:32,287
Even if Simon Phoenix was programmed
to escape, extinguish life and steal...

1105
01:20:32,454 --> 01:20:34,247
...why are you going to the wasteland?

1106
01:20:34,414 --> 01:20:38,084
Your city-wide manhunt didn't work,
because Phoenix was in the one place that...

1107
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:39,878
...A, you can't monitor...

1108
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:43,757
...B, are afraid to go and,
C, don't give a shit about.

1109
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:47,802
I wanna go down there, find Phoenix
and put him in a hurt locker.

1110
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:53,016
So you wanna come with me
or you wanna arrest me, huh?

1111
01:20:53,183 --> 01:20:56,019
Okay. I'm with you.

1112
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:57,854
Let's go blow this guy.

1113
01:21:00,774 --> 01:21:03,526
Away. Blow this guy away.

1114
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:06,029
Whatever.

1115
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:13,411
Got a way with words.

1116
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:23,630
- What's wrong, Huxley?
- It's not very clean.

1117
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:30,053
A real garden spot.

1118
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:32,305
All right, which way?

1119
01:21:32,472 --> 01:21:33,723
Over there.

1120
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,975
All right, guys, be ready for anything.

1121
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:46,361
<i>My dog's better than your dog</i>

1122
01:21:46,528 --> 01:21:48,655
<i>My dog's better than yours</i>

1123
01:21:48,822 --> 01:21:51,366
<i>My dog's better 'cause he gets Ken-L Ration</i>
<i>My dog's--</i>

1124
01:21:51,533 --> 01:21:52,742
Hey.

1125
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:55,328
I'm sorry, but when I'm nervous, I....

1126
01:21:55,829 --> 01:21:57,414
Sorry.

1127
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,998
Over here.

1128
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:22,188
What is that emanation?

1129
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:23,898
Oh, yeah.

1130
01:22:24,524 --> 01:22:25,984
Oh, yeah.

1131
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:27,902
Come on, guys.

1132
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:39,164
No, hey, just relax. All I want is a burger
and a beer, if you got one.

1133
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,792
How am I gonna pay?

1134
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:46,337
- Huxley, it is better to give....
- Ow!

1135
01:22:54,179 --> 01:22:56,264
- Want a slug?
- Ugh.

1136
01:22:58,558 --> 01:22:59,893
No, thank you.

1137
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:01,978
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1138
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:03,730
Oh, God.

1139
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,649
- This is fantastic. You guys gotta try one.
- Oh, my.

1140
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:09,235
Just don't ask
where the meat comes from.

1141
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,737
What's that supposed to mean?

1142
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:13,156
Do you see any cows around here?

1143
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:23,124
Rat?

1144
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,293
This is a rat burger?

1145
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,342
Not bad.

1146
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,387
Matter of fact,
it's the best burger I've had in years.

1147
01:23:38,932 --> 01:23:40,266
See you later.

1148
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,292
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.

1149
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,795
No, they don't.

1150
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:20,557
Now, that's a thing of beauty.

1151
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:23,935
Do you know what this is?

1152
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:28,815
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

1153
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:32,527
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

1154
01:24:32,694 --> 01:24:35,905
Radial tires and bucket seats.

1155
01:24:36,406 --> 01:24:38,825
- I'm impressed.
- I studied.

1156
01:24:38,992 --> 01:24:41,744
So did I. Hand over the glow-rod.

1157
01:24:41,911 --> 01:24:43,913
Your friends too. Come on, move.

1158
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:45,790
Ow!

1159
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,127
- Easy, pal.
- Yeah.

1160
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:55,258
You got ball-balls, coming down here
after the show you put on.

1161
01:24:55,425 --> 01:24:57,510
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

1162
01:24:57,677 --> 01:25:00,513
Can you help or just bully us
with your primitive weapons?

1163
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,770
Well, maybe they're not so primitive.

1164
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:11,941
Think you're taking me in?

1165
01:25:12,609 --> 01:25:14,444
Guess what. Not happening.

1166
01:25:14,986 --> 01:25:18,364
You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
Yeah, that's right.

1167
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:20,700
It'll take an army to get rid of me.

1168
01:25:20,867 --> 01:25:23,119
I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.

1169
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:28,124
Pal, I don't know who the hell you are,
let alone want to take you anywhere.

1170
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:31,044
So stay here, be well
and Cocteau's an asshole!

1171
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:32,337
- Hey!
- Hey, man.

1172
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:35,798
Let's dump them up top.
They're only here to spy on us.

1173
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:38,551
Wait a minute.

1174
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:42,180
You're the guy outside Taco Bell.

1175
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:44,807
Yeah. What do you want?

1176
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:48,227
You weren't part of the Cocteau plan.

1177
01:25:48,394 --> 01:25:52,023
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.

1178
01:25:54,567 --> 01:25:56,903
- That's why everybody's down here?
- Got that right.

1179
01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:00,573
See, according to Cocteau's plan...

1180
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:02,825
...I'm the enemy, because I like to think.

1181
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:06,412
I like to read.
I'm into freedom of speech and choice.

1182
01:26:06,579 --> 01:26:09,666
I'm the kind of guy who likes to sit
in a greasy spoon and wonder:

1183
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,752
"Should I have steak or
jumbo barbecued ribs with gravy fries?"

1184
01:26:12,919 --> 01:26:16,673
I want high cholesterol. I want to eat bacon,
butter and buckets of cheese.

1185
01:26:16,839 --> 01:26:19,550
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar
the size of Cincinnati.

1186
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:23,012
I want to run through the streets naked
with Jell-O all over my body...

1187
01:26:23,179 --> 01:26:26,099
...reading <i>Playboy Magazine,</i>
because I might feel the need to.

1188
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,642
I've seen the future.

1189
01:26:27,809 --> 01:26:29,936
It's a 47-year-old virgin in his pajamas...

1190
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:33,064
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake,
singing, "I'm a wiener."

1191
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:34,691
Up top, you live Cocteau's way.

1192
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:36,943
What he wants, when he wants,
how he wants.

1193
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,196
Your other choice: come down here.

1194
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:41,948
Maybe starve to death.

1195
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:45,827
Why don't you take charge
and lead these people out of here?

1196
01:26:46,202 --> 01:26:47,578
I'm no leader.

1197
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:51,124
I do what I have to do.
Sometimes people come with me.

1198
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:56,421
I just want to bury Cocteau up to his neck
in shit and let him think happy thoughts.

1199
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:58,047
Then I got bad news.

1200
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:01,551
I think he wants to kill you.

1201
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:06,681
All right, gentlemen, let's review.

1202
01:27:07,265 --> 01:27:09,308
The year is 2032.

1203
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:13,354
That's 2-0-3-2.
As in the 21st century.

1204
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:18,401
And I'm sorry to say that the world
has become a pussy-whipped...

1205
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:23,781
<i>...Brady Bunch</i> version of itself
run by a bunch of robed sissies.

1206
01:27:23,948 --> 01:27:26,701
All we have to do
to run the whole thing...

1207
01:27:26,868 --> 01:27:31,080
...is to kill a man named Friendly,
who put it all together.

1208
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:35,126
Ah, but there's an extra added bonus.

1209
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:40,214
We get to kill the man who put most of us
behind the freezer.

1210
01:27:40,381 --> 01:27:43,384
You mean we get to kill John Spartan?

1211
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:44,969
Exactly.

1212
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:48,639
I want you to loot, pillage, plunder.
I want you to steal.

1213
01:27:48,806 --> 01:27:52,226
Do all the wonderful things we used to do
before all of this happened.

1214
01:27:53,936 --> 01:27:55,855
This world will be ours.

1215
01:27:56,105 --> 01:27:57,857
Let's bring back the good old days!

1216
01:27:58,024 --> 01:27:59,776
- Are you with me?
- Yeah!

1217
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:01,944
- Are you with me? Let's do it!
- Yeah!

1218
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:03,613
Yeah!

1219
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:09,535
It is a curious conclusion
which you have deduced, John Spartan.

1220
01:28:10,244 --> 01:28:12,872
But I can find no fault in your logic.

1221
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:14,832
Simon Phoenix is the perfect weapon...

1222
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:17,752
...to send to the savage nether regions
in which we stand.

1223
01:28:17,919 --> 01:28:19,670
I am impressed, John Spartan.

1224
01:28:19,962 --> 01:28:23,090
You mean they thawed this guy out
just to kill me?

1225
01:28:23,674 --> 01:28:26,803
- I'm flattered.
- Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

1226
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:29,013
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

1227
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:32,058
- That's why you're down here?
- Yeah.

1228
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:37,563
I must have done something right
in a previous life.

1229
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:40,066
Can't imagine what that
could have been.

1230
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:43,861
Two for the price of one.

1231
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,405
Let's take them, boys.

1232
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:52,036
Stay down!

1233
01:29:14,851 --> 01:29:16,686
Friendly! Up on top!

1234
01:29:25,444 --> 01:29:28,447
I'll be goddamned.
Like a New York cockroach.

1235
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,759
Fuck it.

1236
01:29:58,060 --> 01:29:59,395
I hate when things go wrong.

1237
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:07,820
Phoenix!

1238
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:19,165
There's an elevator shaft on top
of this place.

1239
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,585
Does that mean we're going up?

1240
01:30:24,337 --> 01:30:25,588
Come on.

1241
01:30:44,106 --> 01:30:47,610
How nice. They must have
been expecting me.

1242
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:04,835
Okay. Now what?

1243
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:06,545
Buckle up.

1244
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:31,278
There he is! He's in my car!

1245
01:31:37,743 --> 01:31:39,203
I'll be goddamned.

1246
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:47,920
What is happening with the cops today?

1247
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:50,589
Don't you know
you're endangering civilians?

1248
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:08,566
Shit.

1249
01:32:09,275 --> 01:32:11,193
- Auto-inflate.
<i>- Auto-inflate.</i>

1250
01:32:12,778 --> 01:32:15,114
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Damn.

1251
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,950
Oh, that is just lovely.

1252
01:32:18,117 --> 01:32:20,161
Huxley, drive.

1253
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,663
Okay, I've read all about this. Now, okay.

1254
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:28,210
So, what do I do? I just push this pedal?

1255
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:31,338
Whoa! Okay, okay. I got it, I got it.

1256
01:32:41,348 --> 01:32:43,642
- Punch it!
- Excuse me?

1257
01:32:44,018 --> 01:32:46,729
Push the pedal as hard as you can!
Just catch up to him!

1258
01:32:46,896 --> 01:32:48,647
- Hold on.
- Faster!

1259
01:32:49,315 --> 01:32:50,775
Faster!

1260
01:32:56,405 --> 01:32:57,448
Shit.

1261
01:32:58,115 --> 01:32:59,283
No free rides!

1262
01:33:04,914 --> 01:33:07,458
- Emergency, doors open.
<i>- Doors opening.</i>

1263
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:10,294
Say hello to my little friend.

1264
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:25,518
- Doors close.
<i>- Malfunction.</i>

1265
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:33,234
Computer, auto-drive.

1266
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,610
<i>Auto-drive engaged.</i>

1267
01:33:34,777 --> 01:33:36,445
Gonna give you a haircut!

1268
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:43,035
Remember those 40 bus passengers
that you blew apart trying to catch me?

1269
01:33:44,537 --> 01:33:46,497
They were already dead.

1270
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:48,791
Cold as Häagen-Dazs.

1271
01:33:56,924 --> 01:33:59,885
Man, I went to jail with a 36-year smile.

1272
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,054
You're dead, Spartan.

1273
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:04,265
Speak for yourself.

1274
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:16,277
- Self-drive.
<i>- Unable to execute.</i>

1275
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:18,070
- Self-drive now.
<i>- Malfunction.</i>

1276
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:20,156
<i>Unable to execute.</i>

1277
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:21,740
Emergency.

1278
01:34:22,283 --> 01:34:24,285
Go left. Right.

1279
01:34:26,078 --> 01:34:27,121
<i>Self-drive engaged.</i>

1280
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:30,958
Brake. Brake.

1281
01:34:32,918 --> 01:34:35,921
Brake now,
you Mickey Mouse piece of shit!

1282
01:35:08,704 --> 01:35:12,541
John Spartan?
John Spartan, are you in there?

1283
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:15,878
- John Spartan!
- Who do you think it is, Huxley?

1284
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:19,131
Here.

1285
01:35:24,386 --> 01:35:27,431
I thought your life force
had been prematurely terminated.

1286
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:29,808
Yeah, I thought I was history too.

1287
01:35:30,017 --> 01:35:33,812
What the hell happened? All of a sudden,
this car turned into a cannoli.

1288
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:36,815
It's securefoam, and it saved your life.

1289
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:39,360
Look at you, you're in shambles.

1290
01:35:39,652 --> 01:35:43,239
Don't worry, I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.

1291
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:45,658
I really didn't say that, did I?

1292
01:35:45,824 --> 01:35:47,117
Damn!

1293
01:35:53,332 --> 01:35:55,042
John Spartan.

1294
01:35:55,209 --> 01:35:57,836
You caveman, you're under arrest.

1295
01:35:58,045 --> 01:36:00,631
You are to be returned to the cryoprison
immediately.

1296
01:36:00,798 --> 01:36:03,300
I heard all about that.
We'll talk later, chief.

1297
01:36:04,260 --> 01:36:06,595
I need something, anything.
A shotgun, a flare gun.

1298
01:36:06,762 --> 01:36:08,013
Spartan.

1299
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:13,686
- Holy shit.
- Defensive red alert.

1300
01:36:15,646 --> 01:36:16,730
Stun batons on.

1301
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:19,900
Relax.

1302
01:36:20,442 --> 01:36:23,779
Look at you. You get a bump on the noggin
and think you're Pancho Villa?

1303
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:27,241
- Who?
- Never mind.

1304
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:28,867
Time to take a stand, pal.

1305
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:32,454
Well, good. While you're doing it,
loan me a gun. Loan me two guns.

1306
01:36:32,621 --> 01:36:34,748
You'd use these weapons
of mass destruction...

1307
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:36,917
...against men and women
who uphold the law?

1308
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:39,545
We use these weapons
to shop for groceries, dick.

1309
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:41,130
Spartan, wait.

1310
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:43,340
You can't leave.

1311
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:48,554
You're under arrest. This very concept
negates the possibility of your leaving.

1312
01:36:48,721 --> 01:36:50,639
Skip it, chief.

1313
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:52,725
Lieutenant Huxley.

1314
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:57,438
Chief, you can take this job
and you can shovel it.

1315
01:36:59,565 --> 01:37:02,860
"Take this job and shovel it."

1316
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:04,528
Yeah?

1317
01:37:04,737 --> 01:37:06,322
Close enough.

1318
01:37:08,324 --> 01:37:10,075
No. No.

1319
01:37:11,702 --> 01:37:16,582
I hadn't counted on this, but I must say,
you worked out beautifully.

1320
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:19,209
People are terrified of you.

1321
01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:22,212
What's new? People have always
been terrified of me.

1322
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:25,174
Yes, but this time,
they're really intimidated.

1323
01:37:27,426 --> 01:37:33,265
Now I'll have carte blanche
to create the perfect society.

1324
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:35,434
My society.

1325
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:40,564
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

1326
01:37:40,731 --> 01:37:43,609
...with the purity of an ant colony.

1327
01:37:43,817 --> 01:37:47,112
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

1328
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:49,448
You can't take away people's
right to be assholes.

1329
01:37:49,615 --> 01:37:50,699
Hmm?

1330
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:53,452
That's who you remind me of...

1331
01:37:53,952 --> 01:37:55,537
...an evil Mr. Rogers.

1332
01:37:55,954 --> 01:37:57,247
Will you please kill him?

1333
01:37:57,414 --> 01:37:58,665
He's pissing me off.

1334
01:38:09,843 --> 01:38:12,012
Put another log on the fire!

1335
01:38:13,597 --> 01:38:15,432
I'm gonna love running this place.

1336
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:24,566
Well, now...

1337
01:38:24,733 --> 01:38:28,612
...what shall I do with you, huh, Bobby?

1338
01:38:28,779 --> 01:38:31,573
I am an excellent associate, sir.

1339
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:34,993
I would be delighted to continue
my services during your administration.

1340
01:38:36,328 --> 01:38:38,163
Ah. Maybe we'll use him.

1341
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:39,957
Excuse me, the police are here.

1342
01:39:08,777 --> 01:39:10,696
Who in the hell do you think--?

1343
01:39:29,131 --> 01:39:30,799
I'm impressed.

1344
01:39:32,384 --> 01:39:33,594
Huxley!

1345
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:46,607
That man has died by my hands.

1346
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:49,234
It was either him or us, Huxley.

1347
01:39:50,277 --> 01:39:51,820
Yeah, there is that.

1348
01:39:51,987 --> 01:39:53,906
Where'd you learn to kick like that?

1349
01:39:54,573 --> 01:39:57,910
- Oh, um, Jackie Chan movies.
- Ah.

1350
01:40:05,751 --> 01:40:08,712
Looks like the Cocteau plan
just went up in smoke.

1351
01:40:09,171 --> 01:40:11,715
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

1352
01:40:12,299 --> 01:40:17,095
Oh, John Spartan, civilization as we know it
will come to an end.

1353
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:18,639
What will we do?

1354
01:40:18,805 --> 01:40:20,807
I don't know.
But trust me, this is better for you.

1355
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:23,227
What's that?

1356
01:40:27,856 --> 01:40:29,358
This is bad.

1357
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:30,776
This is very bad.

1358
01:40:30,943 --> 01:40:34,821
He's accessed the cryoprison and he's
about to defrost the entire multi-lifer wing.

1359
01:40:34,988 --> 01:40:36,281
Most of them don't like you.

1360
01:40:36,448 --> 01:40:40,160
Most of these guys don't even like
their own mothers. These are bad boys.

1361
01:40:40,327 --> 01:40:41,745
How many are there?

1362
01:40:44,998 --> 01:40:47,501
Eighty. All without rehab.

1363
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:49,670
They'll be reanimated within the hour.

1364
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:51,213
We gotta stop this.

1365
01:40:53,465 --> 01:40:57,261
I'm not at all pleased about having caused
the fatality of that deranged CryoCon.

1366
01:40:57,427 --> 01:41:02,349
But I now understand that under certain
circumstances, violence is necessary.

1367
01:41:02,558 --> 01:41:04,226
Good.

1368
01:41:08,438 --> 01:41:10,732
Then I hope you understand this.

1369
01:41:19,575 --> 01:41:21,827
Oh, I hope my butt didn't look like that.

1370
01:41:21,994 --> 01:41:24,663
Okay, who do we have left that's good?

1371
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:26,290
Let's see.

1372
01:41:26,456 --> 01:41:28,208
Wilkes, Patrick.

1373
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:30,502
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

1374
01:41:30,669 --> 01:41:32,921
We gotta get him.
How long before they're done?

1375
01:41:33,088 --> 01:41:36,758
- They're in the final stages of reanimation.
- Great. Absolutely great.

1376
01:41:39,219 --> 01:41:40,679
Gentlemen.

1377
01:41:40,846 --> 01:41:45,100
Thank you very much, but your services
will no longer be required.

1378
01:41:51,148 --> 01:41:53,900
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

1379
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:14,630

Phoenix!

1389
01:43:20,195 --> 01:43:22,030
Didn't expect that one, did you?

1390
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:23,573
Where are you going?

1391
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:25,534
I wish you the best of luck, sir.

1392
01:43:26,535 --> 01:43:27,869
Stupid.

1393
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,422
Spartan, how's it hanging, huh?

1394
01:43:38,588 --> 01:43:42,300
I'm sure you're familiar with
the long arm of the law, aren't you?

1395
01:43:46,972 --> 01:43:49,641
Why don't you struggle a little bit?
Make me work for it.

1396
01:43:49,808 --> 01:43:55,522
What do you say? How about
a little target practice? What do you say?

1397
01:44:04,156 --> 01:44:06,032
Didn't hurt your head, did you?

1398
01:44:24,634 --> 01:44:27,137
Shit. Piece-of-shit gun. Damn.

1399
01:44:34,603 --> 01:44:35,687
Fuck.

1400
01:44:47,657 --> 01:44:49,576
That's it, Spartan.

1401
01:44:49,743 --> 01:44:51,745
You're not getting out of this one.

1402
01:44:54,498 --> 01:44:57,167
I could drop you in that vat
of defrost over there...

1403
01:44:57,334 --> 01:44:59,294
...and fry your ass like a chicken.

1404
01:45:00,587 --> 01:45:03,548
Or with my little pinky,
drop your monkey ass down--

1405
01:45:06,426 --> 01:45:08,470
I'll be goddamned.

1406
01:45:49,636 --> 01:45:51,847
Shit! Goddamn! What am I doing wrong?

1407
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:58,270
<i>Cryoprisoner reanimation</i>
<i>sequence now entering final stage.</i>

1408
01:46:03,608 --> 01:46:06,528
Is it cold in here, or is it just me?

1409
01:46:08,154 --> 01:46:09,281
Good memory.

1410
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:17,372
Come here. Come here.

1411
01:46:17,539 --> 01:46:18,957
Piece of shit!

1412
01:46:29,676 --> 01:46:31,428
I hate cops!

1413
01:46:35,557 --> 01:46:38,101
Look in my eyes, John.
I'll see you in hell.

1414
01:46:38,268 --> 01:46:39,477
Not.

1415
01:47:22,687 --> 01:47:25,398
This is the best day of my life.

1416
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:57,055
Heads up!

1417
01:48:47,981 --> 01:48:51,860
You have apprehended the villain
responsible for murdering Cocteau?

1418
01:48:52,027 --> 01:48:55,030
I wouldn't exactly say apprehended.
Let's just say he's history.

1419
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:58,575
And the cryoprison, that's history too.

1420
01:49:01,786 --> 01:49:05,206
What will we do? How will we live?

1421
01:49:05,373 --> 01:49:09,044
We're all gonna go out drinking,
get shit-faced and paint the town, literally.

1422
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,296
Put up graffiti, slogans. It'll be a blast.

1423
01:49:11,463 --> 01:49:13,923
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

1424
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:16,009
Why don't you get a little dirty?

1425
01:49:16,176 --> 01:49:17,761
You, a lot clean.

1426
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:20,013
And somewhere in the middle....

1427
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:22,432
I don't know. You'll figure it out.

1428
01:49:22,891 --> 01:49:24,476
Fucking A.

1429
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:28,938
Well put.

1430
01:49:29,314 --> 01:49:32,317
Mr. Friendly? Greetings and salutations,
Edgar Friendly.

1431
01:49:32,484 --> 01:49:34,903
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

1432
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:38,656
...it would be a pleasure
to assist you in creating a more humane--

1433
01:49:38,823 --> 01:49:41,659
- Bob. Bob. Let's talk about the hair, okay?
- Hair?

1434
01:49:41,826 --> 01:49:43,620
Pick a color. And lose the kimono.

1435
01:49:43,787 --> 01:49:45,246
- You look like a couch.
- A couch?

1436
01:49:45,413 --> 01:49:47,248
Are you a surgeon with these gloves?

1437
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:55,006
Thank you for rendering me
unconscious.

1438
01:49:56,341 --> 01:49:57,759
I did it for your own good.

1439
01:49:57,926 --> 01:49:59,677
- We're supposed to be a team.
- We are.

1440
01:50:09,354 --> 01:50:10,855
Oh, my. Heh.

1441
01:50:11,397 --> 01:50:14,067
Are all fluid-transfer activities like this?

1442
01:50:14,234 --> 01:50:16,611
- Better.
- Better?

1443
01:50:17,028 --> 01:50:18,363
Oh, my.

1444
01:50:21,783 --> 01:50:23,535
I think I'm gonna like the future.

1445
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:26,329
Now that you've demolished everything.

1446
01:50:26,746 --> 01:50:28,957
But there's just one thing
I want to know:

1447
01:50:29,124 --> 01:50:32,377
How's that damn
three-seashell thing work?
