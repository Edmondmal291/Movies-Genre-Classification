Yeah?</font>

41

43
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bought a little machine

with that, uh, fish.</font>

50
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.
All right, I'll see you.</font>

on Wall Street.</font>

57
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was a Pip.
Yo, you were a pimp?</font>

58
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not a pimp. A Pip. P-l-P. Pip.</font>

59
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck is a Pip?
Why you gotta curse so much?</font>

66
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the spin?

The one on the right.</font>

70

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, do it again!
Yo, that's not him right there.</font>

71
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, that's him with an Afro.</font>

72
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,282

So he had a wig on.</font>

73

Hm?</font>

84
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fish.
Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah, he did.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not exactly.</font>

87
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Old man tied the fish to the side

91
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just kind of a waste, isn't it?
No, Depends upon how you look at it.</font>

92
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old man met his greatest adversary just when
he thought that part of his life was over.</font>

93

96
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,049

97
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,722

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All eyes on me
As I'm leaving the scene</font>

136
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Loaded with poison,
just like you like it.</font>

137
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it your birthday?</font>

138
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was some guy at work.
I didn't want to waste it.</font>

139
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy birthday,
Some Guy at Work.</font>

140
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old are you?</font>

141
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old are you?</font>

142
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't really matter.</font>

143
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
I'm breaking protocol, right?</font>

144
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Listen, hey,
come on, sit down.</font>

145
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit. Sit.</font>

146
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sit.</font>

147
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

148
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, sit down.
All right.</font>

149
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure I'm not interrupting
anything?</font>

150
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

151
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So?</font>

152
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

153
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I just kind of felt
like a quiet voice.</font>

154
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before it all goes crazy.</font>

155
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

156
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Teri.</font>

157
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bob.</font>

158
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow.</font>

159
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good.
You know, you don't look like a Bob.</font>

160
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? Thank you.</font>

161
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a Robert.</font>

162
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert reads books like this,</font>

163
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Bob watches TV.</font>

164
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My real name's Alina.</font>

165
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to your face?</font>

166
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something stupid.</font>

167
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, it's not professional.
Just tell me what you think, okay?</font>

168
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow. Alina the singer.</font>

169
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I know what I really am.</font>

170
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you can be anything
you wanna be.</font>

171
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe in your world, Robert.</font>

172
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't really happen that way in mine.
Change your world.</font>

173
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no ring.
Hm?</font>

174
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On your wedding finger, there's no ring.
No.</font>

175
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No Mrs. Robert at home?</font>

176
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

177
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there ever?</font>

178
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once.</font>

179
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you break her heart?</font>

180
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She broke mine.</font>

181
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
I see a lot of widowed guys.</font>

182
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something in your eyes.</font>

183
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's not sad.</font>

184
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just kind of...</font>

185
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lost, you know?</font>

186
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You always read books?</font>

187
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wife did. She, uh...</font>

188
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was working way through
the 100 Books Everybody Should Read.</font>

189
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She made it to 97, so I figured...</font>

190
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd give it a shot.</font>

191
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And one day we'd have something
to talk about when we get together.</font>

192
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, a hundred books.
Yeah.</font>

193
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy moly-Heh, heh.</font>

194
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many have you read, Robert?
91.</font>

195
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, this damn thing.</font>

196
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">91 books, though.</font>

197
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're almost done.
Almost.</font>

198
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you gonna do after that?
Take singing lessons.</font>

199
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'm gonna open
a donut factory.</font>

200
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heh-heh-heh.
I am. What? Why you laughing?</font>

201
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I love being up at this hour.
Yeah?</font>

202
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you know everything's so dark.</font>

203
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes everything
seem possible again.</font>

204
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, me,
I can't sleep at night.</font>

205
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
I get to hear your stories.</font>

206
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your new one about?</font>

207
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's about a guy who thinks
he's a knight in shining armor.</font>

208
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing is, he lives in a world where
knights don't exist anymore.</font>

209
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of sounds like
my world. Heh.</font>

210
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just up the block.</font>

211
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna grab a cab or something.</font>

212
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for the quiet voice,
Robert.</font>

213
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are very welcome, Alina.</font>

214
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

215
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Catch you around, all right?
Good night.</font>

216
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

217
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you.</font>

218
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do, huh?</font>

219
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do
to that customer?</font>

220
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slavi, he hit me.</font>

221
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck do you think you are? Hm?</font>

222
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right.</font>

223
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand.</font>

224
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all right, Robert.</font>

225
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's talk about you
not answering my calls.</font>

226
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bitch!</font>

227
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should we give him
a card?</font>

228
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This girl, she's no good.</font>

229
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call this number.
I send you another one. Better.</font>

230
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be shy. Make the call.</font>

231
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand.</font>

232
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coffee?</font>

233
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need more sugar out here.</font>

234
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard she's at the ICU at Shawmuts.
Someone beat her up real good.</font>

235
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dr. Paley to ICU.
Dr. Paley to ICU, please.</i></font>

236
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Dr. Mark to the pharmacy.
Dr. Mark to the pharmacy, please.</i></font>

237
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alina.</font>

238
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be okay, Alina. You'll be okay.</font>

239
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Watch it.
Don't you worry about it.</font>

240
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay.
Here you go.</font>

241
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can... It's fine. Thank you.
Got it.</font>

242
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's she doing?</font>

243
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alina. How's she doing?</font>

244
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?
Just a friend.</font>

245
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A guy hit her.</font>

246
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she hit him back.</font>

247
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A guy called Slavi.</font>

248
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Slavi made example of her.</font>

249
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They do that.</font>

250
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They burned one girl's face
with battery acid.</font>

251
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep her around as a reminder
for the rest of us.</font>

252
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They brought Teri over
very young.</font>

253
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think she got to the point where</font>

254
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she thought her life
could be hers one day.</font>

255
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slavi reminded her it never would be.</font>

256
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said he'd cut her throat
next time.</font>

257
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said a whore who fucks
and can't talk might be worth twice as much.</font>

258
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and I know what I really am.</font>

259
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's something in your eyes.</i></font>

260
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Change your world.
Anything you wanna be.</i></font>

261
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He said he'd cut her throat next time.</i></font>

262
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that piece of shit
in my parking space?</font>

263
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Slavi.</font>

264
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are they upstairs?
Yes.</font>

265
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tevi. You collect
from that fuck, Dmitri?</font>

266
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

267
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked for forgiveness.</font>

268
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgiveness?</font>

269
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him.</font>

270
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I, Jesus Christ?
Ha-ha-ha.</font>

271
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lost, dedushka?</font>

272
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did he get up here?
I don't know.</font>

273
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I get rid of him?</font>

274
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

275
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for that girl.</font>

276
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave me that
a couple of nights ago.</font>

277
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We give out lots of cards.</font>

278
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still can get it up, dedushka?</font>

279
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here about a certain girl.</font>

280
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She got beat up pretty bad.</font>

281
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm thinking that maybe
you have wrong address, dedushka.</font>

282
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This girl, she have name?</font>

283
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her name's Alina.
Alina?</font>

284
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-mm.
Ah...</font>

285
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it doesn't ring a bell.</font>

286
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But whoever she is,
I'm sure she must know how to suck the cock.</font>

287
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Okay. Um...</font>

288
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I understand.</font>

289
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These girls that you, uh...</font>

290
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you represent.</font>

291
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand it's like
they're an investment, so, urn...</font>

292
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can give you $9800.</font>

293
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cash.</font>

294
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wanting to give me $9000?</font>

295
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9800. Cash.</font>

296
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For what?
Her freedom.</font>

297
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-huh. Heh, heh.</font>

298
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you believe this guy?</font>

299
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy gonna give me $9000
for one single piece of pussy.</font>

300
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, must be Ferrari pussy.</font>

301
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking Americans think that
you can come into my place and business.</font>

302
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and just buy whatever you want.</font>

303
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beautiful Russian girls,
no problem, just throw down this bullshit money.</font>

304
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking insult me.</font>

305
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha-ha-ha.
I'm just fucking with you, man.</font>

306
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you got very big balls
coming in here. I like that.</font>

307
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, $9000</font>

308
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the troublemaker.</font>

309
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One month.</font>

310
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

311
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think
this is one-time payment?</font>

312
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I make this off this girl
in 2 weeks.</font>

313
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That girl is still child.</font>

314
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still can sell her as virgin, huh?</font>

315
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This makes prime earner
for good while.</font>

316
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take your fucking money
and go back to your house and jerk yourself off 9800 times.</font>

317
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then come crawling back here
and talk to me, huh?</font>

318
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She'll be used up by then
for sure.</font>

319
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe then I will let you have her
for nothing. Hm?</font>

320
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

321
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're okay, dedushka?
Bye-bye.</font>

322
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know amerikantsy.</i></font>

323
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You forget something?</font>

324
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">16 seconds.</font>

325

three one-thousand.</font>

327
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eight one-thousand.</font>

328
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand?</font>

329
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">28 minus 9, 19.</font>

330
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">19.</font>

331
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your heart's beating three times
the normal rate.</font>

332
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's because you're losing so much blood.</font>

333
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About 30 seconds,
your body's gonna shut down</font>

334
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're gonna suffocate.</font>

335
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alina, the girl you beat half to death,
her life will go on.</font>

336
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yours is gonna end right here,
on this funky floor</font>

337
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over $9800.</font>

338
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have taken the money.</font>

339
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

340
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,082

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

344
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. McCall, it's lunchtime.</font>

345
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. McCall.</font>

346
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lunchtime.</font>

347
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You test tomorrow
and you're still eating that salty stuff?</font>

348
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are for you.</font>

349
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open it.</font>

350
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made the weight.</font>

351
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow I'm gonna ace that test Mr, McCall.
Thanks to you.</font>

352
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?
Uh...</font>

353
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hit it on something stupid.</font>

354
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>In what investigators are calling
a gangland-style execution,</i></font>

360
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing, sir?
Morgan Pederson.</font>

361
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know who you are.
Get in the car.</font>

362
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to the murder scene.</font>

363
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We figured 2, maybe 3,
guys killed them all that quickly.</font>

364
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,441

no one saw it coming.</font>

365
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of our informants heard
about this going down.</font>

366
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Security system's hard drive was taken
so we're blind in here.</font>

367
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we know at 11:17, a waiter goes up
with a tray of food, finds them dead.</font>

368
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,283

I tend to call at odd hours.</font>

372
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if you could drive me
to my residence.</font>

373
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, wait a second, Mr. Sunshine.
Um...</font>

374
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do I look like to you?
A fucking chauffeur?</font>

375
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our town.
You're a fucking guest.</font>

376
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me apologize for my conduct.</font>

377
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a long flight on short notice,
and I like to focus, to work quickly.</font>

378
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The deaths of Mr. Pushkin's men
have interrupted his operations here.</font>

379
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Imports, movements of goods,
have all ceased.</font>

380
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's unacceptable.</font>

381
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the one Mr. Pushkin calls in
when people like you fuck up.</font>

382
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm. I don't like your tone...
I'm accountable now.</font>

383
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have taken
Mr. Pushkin's money for years.</font>

384
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Money that comes with conditions.
Non-negotiable conditions.</font>

385
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Problem you're having with me
is you still think you matter. You don't.</font>

386
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am all that matters.
And so we're clear:</font>

387
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not here to say "please."</font>

388
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to tell you what to do.</font>

389
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be ready for business.</font>

390
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We open tomorrow.</font>

391
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brian, you seen Ralphie?
Supposed to be taking that security guard test after work.</font>

392
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Called in and quit.
Quit?</font>

393
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No notice either.
Kids, right?</font>

394
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're closed.</font>

395
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. McCall.
Ralphie.</font>

396
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heard you quit today.
I got worried.</font>

397
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

398
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, uh, my mom had
a little accident here last night.</font>

399
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a fire.</font>

400
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see.
So I'm gonna help out around here now.</font>

401
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

402
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have a lot of work to do.
Okay.</font>

403
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, so...
Need some help?</font>

404
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, if you're not doing anything,
that'd be awesome.</font>

405
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Helping you.</font>

406
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen Teddy, I already check this out the Irish are clean on this one.
They had nothing to do with it, huh?</font>

407
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, You gonna sit down
with all these guys?</font>

408
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you.
Yes, I understand. Duly noted.</font>

409
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, huh?
Do me a favor, all right?</font>

410
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever you do,
don't call him "Little John," okay?</font>

411
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Frank, why you working
for these fucking Russians?</font>

412
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My money not good enough?</font>

413
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John you know I got respect for your business.
Mr. Looney.</font>

414
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand why I'm compelled
to make this visit.</font>

415
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know shit about
what went down or who you should be out looking for.</font>

416
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I wanna take over anything,
I'd fucking do it.</font>

417
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There'd be nothing left to you people.</font>

418
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So maybe you just don't
understand who the fuck I am.</font>

419
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John. Easy, huh?</font>

420
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't "easy," Frank.
Shut the fuck up! Fucking flipperhead.</font>

421
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I hate you fucking Russians.</font>

422
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all crazy and you're arrogant.</font>

423
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the Irish, we came here for a piece
of the American dream.</font>

424
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You people come over here to steal it,
so fuck all of you.</font>

425
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Mr. Looney,
I appreciate your candor.</font>

426
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's refreshing, and let me understand that you're
not smart enough to have done this.</font>

427
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck'?
Which brings me to my next issue.</font>

428
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We pay you 15 percent
to do business here.</font>

429
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The additional 10 percent you steal,
we ignore.</font>

430
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We anticipated it,
as you people are such cliches.</font>

431
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:13,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fact that you're a rat to the Feds is also tolerable,
Little John.</font>

432
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck'?
What we will not tolerate is</font>

433
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">getting nothing for our money:
no information, no protection,</font>

434
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">no assurances.
You understand, Little Johnny?</font>

435
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck do you think you are coming down here?
Who I am, or what I am?</font>

436
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who I am is complicated.
What I am is easier. I'm a threat.</font>

437
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I alter outcomes.
Throw this motherf... Unh!</font>

438
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Whoa, doctor! Call a doctor.
Unbelievable!</i></font>

00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It's Napoli in the clutch!</i></font>

440
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Holy cow!</i></font>

441
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck!</font>

442
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A tie game. Unbelievable!</i></font>

443
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That ball was absolutely massacred
by Mike Napoli.</i></font>

444
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A home run by Napoli.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Can things change in an instant.
They certainly can.</i></font>

00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This game was over
before this half-inning started.</i></font>

447
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>It is certainly over now!</i></font>

Boston over New York...</i></font>

450
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hey.</font>

451
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my town. Do you understand me?
This is my home.</font>

452
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot run around
like a fucking wild animal.</font>

453
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck was that?</font>

454
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a message.</font>

455
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It says, "I'm here."</font>

456
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What really happened in there,
Ralphie?</font>

457
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faulty wire or something.</font>

458
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We both know that's not true.</font>

459
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry I wasted your time.
Hey, you didn't waste my time, don't worry about it.</font>

460
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom doesn't have much
except this place and.</font>

461
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When stuff like this happens,
I just gotta put everything on hold for awhile</font>

462
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and help her out, you know?</font>

463
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking I wasn't gonna pass
the security guard test anyway.</font>

464
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there anything unusually strange about Slavi
before he was murdered?</font>

465
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he mention a name perhaps?
Agitated about something?</font>

466
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slavi never did his business
in front of the girls.</font>

467
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tevi handled us.</font>

00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't locate one of the other girls
from Slavi's stable. Teri.</font>

469
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
You know her?</font>

470
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where we might find her?
No. Sorry.</font>

471
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know her that well.</font>

473
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Mr. Pushkin.</font>

474
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of our associates...
Irish, Italians, Armenians.</font>

475
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are all denying any knowledge
or involvement.</font>

476
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We cannot show weakness.
I need this wrapped up quickly.</i></font>

477
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be.</font>

478
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, don't worry.</font>

479
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

480
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now enough of what you don't know.</i></font>

481
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tell me what you do know.</i></font>

482
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm still sifting through things,
but the killings were spontaneous.</font>

483
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever did this specialized in killing.</font>

484
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've rarely seen skills like this.</font>

485
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think it's someone
we've encountered before.</font>

486
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Whoever it is, just find him, Teddy.</i></font>

487
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm talking over a million barrels,
this delivery.</i></font>

488
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Understand?
It will all be well.</font>

489
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take care of it.</font>

490
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When you do, be loud about it.</i></font>

491
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't want this happening again.</i></font>

492
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

493
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

494
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stuff it in.</font>

495
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See that?</font>

496
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That son of a bitch.</font>

497
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.
Come on.</font>

498
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're closed. Get out.
Let's go.</font>

499
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Time to go.</font>

500
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you.</font>

501
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See? You pay on time,
no more problems.</font>

502
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ha-ha-ha.
All right, let's go.</font>

503
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mamacita, you need to clean
the grease.</font>

504
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll cause a fire.
Good accent.</font>

505
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you next week.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go get a blowie.
Hey, officers.</font>

507
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, put the light down.
What's up?</font>

508
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to report a crime.
Really? Call 911.</font>

509
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get out of here.
Fuck that guy.</font>

510
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah I should have shoot that motherfucker.
Take it easy.</font>

511
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you get this job?
I blew the commissioner.</font>

512

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why waste city services</i></font>

513
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,690

This fucking guy?</font>

515
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.
Back up.</font>

516
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get
that fucking number?</font>

517
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't hard.
Yeah?</font>

523
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One.</font>

Ha-ha-ha. Why would we do that?</font>

528
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,686

531
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and throw you
in the fucking Mystic, huh?</font>

532
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do that.
It's a good idea.</font>

533
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to stand
for something, punk.</font>

534
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

535
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Protect and serve. Uphold the law.</font>

536
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Justice.</font>

537
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember?</font>

538
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck are you?</font>

539
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:43,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tomorrow you'll have returned all the
money you extorted from those people.</i></font>

540
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You tell them it will never happen again.</i></font>

541
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do that,
and this video will never be seen.</i></font>

542
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You don't, and a half an hour later
you'll watch the uncut version</i></font>

543
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>on every news outlet in the area.</i></font>

544
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now, I'm offering you a chance
to do the right thing. Take it.</i></font>

545
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That fucking hurt more
than the beating.</font>

546
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. McCall. Are you done
standing around or what?</font>

547
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the other girls have...</font>

548
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:40,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">claimed that you were
very close to Teri. Huh?</font>

549
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lied to me about that.</font>

550
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty.</font>

551
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did you last talk to her?</font>

552
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over a week ago.
Mm-hm.</font>

553
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I went to the hospital.</font>

554
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw her there.</font>

555
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did anyone else visit her?</font>

556
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

557
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man.
A man?</font>

558
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
Customer?</font>

559
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A nice man. A black man.</font>

560
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wanted to know
what happened to her.</font>

561
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His name?</font>

562
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't say.</font>

563
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your friend, Teri?</font>

564
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one saw her
after she left hospital.</font>

565
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:54,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After what they did to her.</font>

566
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you contacted her?
No.</font>

567
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one saw her.</font>

568
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at me.
Are you telling me the truth?</font>

569
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You telling me the truth? The truth?
Yes. Yes.</font>

570
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You telling me the truth?
Yes.</font>

571
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Telling me the truth?
Yes.</font>

572
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like some water?</font>

573
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Moisten your throat.</font>

574
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

575
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweet.</font>

576
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My angel.</font>

577
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm? Yes.
Please. Please.</font>

578
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So beautiful. So beautiful.
Please, please, Teddy. Please, Teddy.</font>

579
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But so deceitful.
Please. Please don't.</font>

580
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So fucking deceitful.
Please don't.</font>

581
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're... You're hurting me!</font>

582
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please stop.</font>

583
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, Home Mart!</font>

584
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!
Keep it going, Home Mart!</font>

585
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go. Oh, oh, oh!</font>

586
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it! I got it! I got it!</font>

587
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

588
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

589
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go! Way to go, Bobby!</font>

590
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no place like Home Mart.</font>

591
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

592
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

593
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you!
Ralphie, bravo!</font>

594
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You passed your test!</font>

595
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking good, man.</font>

596
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, did they give you a gun?</font>

597
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell he call us in here for?</font>

598
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe he's finally done
chasing his own tail.</font>

599
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needs to go home.
Waste of fucking time.</font>

600
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that sounds about right.</font>

601
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I matched
the arrival and departure times</font>

602
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of everyone going in and out
of the restaurant and I discovered the curious.</font>

603
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This person walks in the front door
several minutes after Slavi arrived,</font>

604
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but never comes out.</font>

605
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Later. All right.
Thanks.</font>

606
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.</font>

607
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you do
a quick card refund for me?</font>

608
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentleman's in a hurry.
Open that fucking register I just said.</font>

609
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, move.
Empty the register. Now.</font>

610
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead, open this thing up.</font>

611
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell this bitch to fucking move it.
Open the register up right now.</font>

612
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move.</font>

613
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it. Give me all of it.</font>

614
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
Move, move, move.</font>

615
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That ring too. Give me that ring.
No.</font>

616
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that fucking ring, I said.
Please.</font>

617
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was my mother's.</font>

618
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck your mother. Give me that ring.</font>

619
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take it off.
It was my mother's.</font>

620
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>

621
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care.
Give me the fucking ring.</font>

622
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.
It's okay, Jenny.</font>

623
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

624
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

625
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, listen. Police said
the guy's done for like this.</font>

626
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shot a guy over in Somerville
a month ago, so...</font>

627
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's only money.</font>

628
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?
Hey, Ralphie. Still a little freaked out.</font>

629
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you need anything,
let me know.</font>

630
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Ralphie.</font>

631
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

632
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ring?</font>

633
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. McCall. Sorry to bother you.
Yeah.</font>

634
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're looking into a homicide
that occurred 2 weeks ago.</font>

635
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5 dead. Russian restaurant.</font>

636
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard about it on TV.
I happened to be there that night.</font>

637
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you were?
Yeah.</font>

638
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
That's right.</font>

639
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:59,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just checking to see if any the patrons
remembered anything suspicious that night.</font>

640
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that I recall.</font>

641
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I ask why you dined
at that particular restaurant?</font>

642
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like pirozhki.</font>

643
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's 5 authentic Russian restaurants
in walking distance of your apartment.</font>

644
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assume they all serve pirozhki.</font>

645
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. I was meeting a friend.
It was her idea.</font>

646
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I guess I should talk...
Sheila Saunders.</font>

647
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But she won't any help. She wasn't there.
Her daughter had a fever.</font>

648
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't stay long?
I didn't check my watch.</font>

649
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see. Well, thanks
for your cooperation.</font>

650
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:33,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very welcome.
Tell me, do you know this girl?</font>

651
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I don't know...</font>

652
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember where from.
What happened?</font>

653
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She fell down and broke her neck.
Did she?</font>

654
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be in touch.</font>

655
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:50,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you wanna leave me
your card, officer?</font>

656
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In case I remember anything?
That's what you policemen usually do, right?</font>

657
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Must have given them all out.
How'd you find me?</font>

658
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I paid cash. We didn't have a reservation.
How'd you find me?</font>

659
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's what we do, Mr. McCall.
We who?</font>

660
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We find people we need to find.
We who?</font>

661
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything about him is wrong.</font>

662
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his military history?</font>

663
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

664
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep digging</font>

665
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what we have
on McCall so far:</font>

666
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">College-educated.
Works a straight 40 at the Home Mart.</font>

667
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bank statements, tax returns, all jive.</font>

668
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks pretty normal.</font>

669
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All lies. Fabricated.</font>

670
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We need to take him cleanly.</i></font>

671
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alive.</font>

672
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A place without cameras,
no witnesses.</font>

673
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man with his skills,
I want to know who he really is.</font>

674
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to know who he's working for.</font>

675
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing?</font>

676
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a coffee, please.</font>

677
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An egg sandwich too. On a roll.
No cheese, please.</font>

678
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it.</font>

679
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back in a minute.</font>

680
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it just you, or are we waiting
for someone else?</font>

681
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. What?</font>

682
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your hands.</font>

683
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you really work on power lines,
your hands wouldn't look like that.</font>

684
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta be waiting
for somebody else.</font>

685
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker.</font>

686
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands where I can see them.</font>

687
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:28,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna take a little walk
across the street. Black Denali.</font>

688
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

689
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

690
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vary from these instructions
and I'll kill you, understand?</font>

691
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

692
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stand up.</font>

693
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck is this? Masters, let's go.</font>

694
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No witnesses.</font>

695
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on out there?</font>

696
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?
Let's go.</font>

697
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh.</font>

698
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is this guy doing?</font>

699
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remar, you got A side. Front, follow.</font>

700
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got C. I got B.</font>

701
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alive.</font>

702
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:51,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, alive. I'm on it.</font>

703
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:09,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker.</font>

704
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker suckered me.</font>

705
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn it.</font>

706
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

707
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Pederson, check the closets,
the kitchen, the back porch.</i></font>

708
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,606
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Closet's empty.</i></font>

709
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Nothing on the back porch.
Fucking guy. Lives like a monk.</i></font>

710
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This guy's got a lot of fucking books.</i></font>

711
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Remar, stop fucking around.
Check the computer.</i></font>

712
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This place is way too clean, boss.
Something doesn't feel right.</i></font>

713
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've got an empty script. "Meclizine."</font>

714
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's used for airsickness.</font>

715
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Travel items purchased
3 days ago.</font>

716
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Bought an open-ended plane ticket
to Mexico 2 days ago.</i></font>

717
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leaves Logan 10 a.m. tomorrow.
Guy knew this was coming.</font>

718
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's running.
Get someone down at the airport.</font>

719
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He is not going anywhere.
What are you talking about?</i></font>

720
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's watching us.</i></font>

721
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you wanna do?</font>

722
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find him, or I will
bring people who can.</font>

723
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you've come for my help,
I can't give you any.</font>

724
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.
Do you?</font>

725
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just came for tea.</font>

726
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just, uh...</font>

727
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert, I have very little influence
these days.</font>

728
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not at the Agency anymore.</font>

729
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I consult on a few things. That's it.</font>

730
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:19,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Susan, I just need to know
who this man is.</font>

731
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is he to you?</font>

732
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:32,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I'm here,
trying to find out.</font>

733
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me what's going on. Please.</font>

734
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:51,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had a nice funeral,
in case you were wondering.</font>

735
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, when they told Susan
you were dead,</font>

736
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she couldn't comprehend it.</font>

737
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said, "Oh, no. Not Robert.</font>

738
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not from something
as trivial as a car bomb."</font>

739
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you're alive</font>

740
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a big relief.</font>

741
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it didn't come
as a complete surprise to her.</font>

742
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We used to talk about you
over the years, and she said</font>

743
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if anyone could have figured
a way out,</font>

744
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a way to walk away from it all
for good, you know,</font>

745
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like a real fresh start...</font>

746
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it would have been...</font>

747
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you.</font>

748
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You didn't take out 5 pimps, Robert.</i></font>

749
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took out the East Coast hub
of Vladimir Pushkin.</font>

750
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushkin.
Mm-hm.</font>

751
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's similar to the other oligarch who jumped in bed
with the Russian mafia,</font>

752
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:20,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">only he funds everything:
gasoline, weapons, girls, you name it.</font>

753
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's built an intricate network
on both U.S. coasts</font>

754
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that are incredibly well-insulated.</font>

755
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His money and political ties
make him untouchable.</font>

756
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:35,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your friend here is who Pushkin sends
when he's got a problem.</font>

757
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teddy Rensen.
Real name, Nicolai ltchenko.</font>

758
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Skill set honed in Spetsnaz.</font>

759
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's formidable and smart.</font>

760
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ran a wing of the secret police
for years.</font>

761
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Went private when the Union fell.</font>

762
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basically, he's a sociopath
with a business card.</font>

763
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

764
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, darling.
You know these two?</font>

765
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

766
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:04,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boston P.D. Probably on
Pushkin's payroll, I assume.</font>

767
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 years. Detective Remar
and Detective Pederson.</font>

768
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only now they're dead.</font>

769
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They found them yesterday
in the trunk of their car in the precinct parking lot.</font>

770
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suffocated. Testicles blown off
and shoved down their throats.</font>

771
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Classic Russian mob hit.
Teddy's work.</font>

772
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:25,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Third one, Detective Masters hasn't
shown up for work in several days.</font>

773
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert, I don't have to tell you
what happens next.</font>

774
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't stop until he kills you
and anyone you care about.</font>

775
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't sleep a wink, did you?</font>

776
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

777
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

778
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robert, that girl, Alina...</font>

779
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

780
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:20,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't tell you
why it mattered.</font>

781
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why what they did to her,
that mattered to me so much.</font>

782
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:27,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One day somebody</font>

783
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">does something unspeakable
to someone else to...</font>

784
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">someone you hardly knew,</font>

785
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you...</font>

786
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do something about it because you can.
Mm.</font>

787
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because it's who you are? Hm?
Mm.</font>

788
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who you've always been?</font>

789
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:52,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes we make the wrong choices
to get to the right place.</font>

790
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm.</font>

791
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know a part of you died
when Vivian did.</font>

792
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not the part
she loved the most.</font>

793
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go be him.</font>

794
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

795
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget to say goodbye.</font>

796
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good bye.</font>

797
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything all right?</font>

798
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:40,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you able to help him?</font>

799
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't come for help.</font>

800
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He came for permission.</font>

801
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

802
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

803
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Testing 1, 2, 3, 4.</font>

804
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushkin.</font>

805
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to know everything:
who, what, when, where, why.</font>

806
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before you tell me
you're not gonna talk...</font>

807
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:35,041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can go fuck yourself,
you know that?</font>

808
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna give me what I need.</font>

809
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or not.
You're such a fuck.</font>

810
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:02,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you get out of here
and go fuck yourself, you fucking motherfucker?</font>

811
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
who the fuck you're dealing with, huh?</font>

812
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a cop, you moron!</font>

813
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to God, I'll fuck...</font>

814
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Open it.</font>

815
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the fucking wind...</font>

816
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

817
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Boston P.D.
I don't have a lot of time.</font>

818
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means you don't have any.</font>

819
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you are in a lot of trouble.</font>

820
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me go. Just let me go.</font>

821
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna let you go.</font>

822
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna let you go.</font>

823
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!
I'll be back.</font>

824
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:51,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker! Wait.</font>

825
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

826
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:55,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait!</font>

827
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We're here to see Andri.</i></font>

828
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Andri. Listen, this location's
been compromised.</font>

829
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta get all your shit out of here.
You gotta truck it all fuck out.</font>

830
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck I'm going to do that.
And who's this fucking piece of shit?</font>

831
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushkin made the call.
I'm just the new guy.</font>

832
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushkin.
Pushkin. I...</font>

833
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:38,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pushkin's fucking money. What the fuck
you give a fuck, Andri, huh?</font>

834
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:52,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ls that a Heckler Koch?</font>

835
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This?
Yeah.</font>

836
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he saying?
I don't fucking...</font>

837
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:05,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I see it?
Oh, you want to see my gun?</font>

838
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yes and no.</font>

839
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.
Oh, fuck!</font>

840
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right, all right!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

841
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so fucking nuts!
Fuck!</font>

842
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
Everybody settle down.</font>

843
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:22,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Frank tells me
you're the man, Andri. Yeah?</font>

844
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says your guys are incredibly loyal toward you.
They do anything you say so</font>

845
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you tell them to put their guns down,
lay down on the floor, put the hands behind their back.</font>

846
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they'll do that, won't they?</font>

847
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:38,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indulge me, Andri.</font>

848
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:41,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to lay down.</font>

849
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go. Thank you very much.</font>

850
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you go.
Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.</font>

851
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going out of business.
Closing down shop.</font>

852
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.
There you are.</font>

853
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go. You're welcome.</font>

854
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Accept these parting gifts on behalf of Mr. Pushkin.
There you go.</font>

855
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three, two...
Look at that, perfect... one.</font>

856
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
Thank you, sweetheart. Right around to the right.</font>

857
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,765

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else I can do for you?
You tell me, Frank.</font>

862
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you got an escape plan.
Where do you keep it?</font>

863
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heh. Yeah? What's
your fucking escape plan, huh?</font>

864
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not about me. It's about you right now.
Where do you keep it?</font>

865
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, you motherfucker.
You have fucked me</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">so fucking bad!</font>

867
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did this, you motherfucker!
Do you hear yourself?</font>

868
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did it to this badge, Frank.</font>

869
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You disrespected this badge.
You understand me?</font>

870
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:04,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, you motherfucker.
I got nothing, all right? I got fucking nothing you hear me?</font>

871
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:06,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got fucking nothing because of you!</font>

872
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think they're not coming for you,
you think you're not fucking next?</font>

873
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a fucking dead man!
Do something about it Frank.</font>

874
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know
who these people are!</font>

875
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a fucking dead man.
I won't last a fucking week.</font>

876
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:20,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then do the right thing.</font>

877
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:23,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfu...</font>

878
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do the right thing, Frank.</font>

879
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Police officer for 22 years,
I know you didn't get this far and not have an out.</font>

880
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you keep it?
I was a fucking good cop.</font>

881
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was.</font>

882
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand.</font>

883
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:47,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do the right thing.</font>

884
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it for the good cops, Frank.</font>

885
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you keep it?</font>

886
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me know when you're done,
detective.</font>

887
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy here.</font>

888
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was cuffed to the pipes back here,
200,000 in the trunk of his car.</font>

889
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Recording of the whole deal
with these guys on the seat.</font>

890
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crazy right. And that was tacked
to his jacket.</font>

891
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not the best part.</font>

892
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on scene for the duration.</font>

893
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get IDs on all those guys.
Check this out.</font>

894
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:02,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit!</font>

895
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</font>

896
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:07,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's gonna fucking count this?</font>

897
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've searched the city.</font>

898
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No sign of him.</i></font>

899
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>McCall has disappeared.</i></font>

900
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Mr. Pushkin has been notified.</i></font>

901
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My men will find him.</font>

902
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

903
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:32,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to piss.</font>

904
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not coming back.</font>

905
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had enough?</font>

906
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You certainly have my attention.
Because I can keep going.</font>

907
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brick by brick. Dollar by dollar.</font>

908
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Body by body.</font>

909
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:24,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you can call your boss and tell him
to shut down his operation.</font>

910
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight.</font>

911
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not much of an offer.
Only one you're gonna get.</font>

912
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you pray for rain,
you gotta deal with the mud too.</font>

913
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:39,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you look at me...</font>

914
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:41,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what do you see?</font>

915
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm?</font>

916
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer's nothing.</font>

917
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:53,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no feelings about you
one way or the other. You're like...</font>

918
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like lint or a bottle cap.</font>

919
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just a thing to remove.</font>

920
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew a Russian police captain
back in the day.</font>

921
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He told me about a case he worked on.
Can't remember the guy's name.</font>

922
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:12,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a famous scholar,
lived in Moscow.</font>

923
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a humanitarian,
an author.</font>

924
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:18,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, he decided to share
his abundance with someone less fortunate.</font>

925
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even though he had five children,
he opened his home to a sixth.</font>

926
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An orphan, 12-year-old boy.</font>

927
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:29,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid had been pounded
by the system from an early age.</font>

928
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:31,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Troubled.</font>

929
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:34,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prone to violence.
A lost cause.</font>

930
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop me if you know this one.
Oh, no. Carry on.</font>

931
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:41,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. So this good man
opened his home to this boy.</font>

932
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when the boy stole from him,
this good man loved him anyway.</font>

933
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:49,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the boy failed in school, this man
showed understanding and patience.</font>

934
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:54,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the boy lied and cheated
and clawed and fought,</font>

935
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:59,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this good man showed compassion
and love</font>

936
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:04,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until the boy, who had never felt
anything like being wanted or loved,</font>

937
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:05,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he finally did.</font>

938
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man had broken through.
It was a miracle.</font>

939
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One week later, intruders broke
into the man's house.</font>

940
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killed the man and his wife in bed.</font>

941
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They said some small things
were stolen,</font>

942
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">things a child might steal.</font>

943
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one knows for sure.</font>

944
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man's children
were sent off to relatives.</font>

945
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boy, the orphan,
shipped back to hell.</font>

946
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:34,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just when he finally had
a chance at life, it was snatched away by two bullets.</font>

947
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a well-known story.
Mm. They ever catch who did it?</font>

948
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did they?</font>

949
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe they didn't look
in the right place.</font>

950
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the answer's
right in front of you.</font>

951
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the boy killed them.</font>

952
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think the boy did it.</font>

953
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boy was scared that his foster parents
would wake up one day</font>

954
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:58,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and realize he wasn't worth it,
like all the others had.</font>

955
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:03,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he couldn't bear the thought
that this good man, this good man would do that to him.</font>

956
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would throw him away...</font>

957
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like a piece of lint or a bottle cap.</font>

958
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:12,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

959
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he decided not to find out.</font>

960
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think, Nicolai?</font>

961
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:25,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you know me?</font>

962
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You strike me as
a sentimental man, Mr. McCall.</font>

963
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's surprising.</font>

964
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I..</font>

965
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't possess that chip.</font>

966
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:40,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never could understand what comes
from feeling that way</font>

967
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except weakness.</font>

968
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The men I killed, your men,</font>

969
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave them a chance.</font>

970
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They made their decision.</font>

971
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:56,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm giving you
the opportunity to make yours.</font>

972
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
You're welcome.</font>

973
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You let me know...</font>

974
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:04,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you decide.</font>

975
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:06,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

976
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done some bad things
in my life, Nicolai.</font>

977
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things I'm not proud of.</font>

978
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promised someone
that I love very much</font>

979
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I would never go back
to being that person.</font>

980
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But for you...</font>

981
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna make an exception.</font>

982
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You asked me what I saw
when I looked at you.</font>

983
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:44,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you see when you look at me?</font>

984
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:52,560

It's simply a matter of time.</font>
