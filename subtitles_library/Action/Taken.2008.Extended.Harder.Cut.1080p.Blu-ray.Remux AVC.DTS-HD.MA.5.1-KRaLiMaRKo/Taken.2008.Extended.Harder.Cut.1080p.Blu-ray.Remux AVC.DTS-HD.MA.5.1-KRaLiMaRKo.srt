00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,157
Twelve- thirty it is.

156
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,284
I'll see you then.

157
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,661
- Here he is. And...?
CASEY: What happened?

158
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,663
- She wants to have lunch.
SAM: Okay.

159
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,041
- Just the two of us.
SAM: All right. Fantastic.

160
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,959
CASEY:
See? There's progress. That's great.

161
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,629
(CROWD CHEERING)

162
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:42,893
Who left that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

163
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,144
BRYAN: Move!
SAM: Go, go!

164
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,898
More security here now!

165
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,691
BRYAN:
That's it. Move.

166
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,200
Casey!

167
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,995
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

168
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,248
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

169
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,797
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

170
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,258
Come on, come on, drink some more.

171
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,969
(SHEERAH SOBBING)

172
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,269
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

173
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,734
You're safe now.

174
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,405
Bernie.

175
00:11:36,572 --> 00:11:38,532
Casey. Rambo.

176
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:42,077
Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

177
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,830
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

178
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,915
- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

179
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,168
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

180
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,755
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

181
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,847
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

182
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,435
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

183
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,730
Yep, since she was 5.

184
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,690
It's not what everyone thinks it is.

185
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:17,070
Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

186
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,739
It's what she wants.

187
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,953
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

188
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,122
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

189
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,875
He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

190
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,002
The second number is my manager.

191
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,755
If Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

192
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:41,053
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

193
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,571
- There she is.
KIM: Dad.

194
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,534
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

195
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,954
- Hi.
- Hi.

196
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,538
Don't look so excited.

197
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,167
I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.

198
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:13,919
I asked Mom to come.

199
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:19,716
One raspberry- banana milkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you like it.

200
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,301
- Thanks.
- Lennie-- Lenore.

201
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,179
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine, thanks.

202
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,223
So?

203
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,225
So, Dad, guess what.

204
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,018
- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

205
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,897
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.

206
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,107
How cool is that?

207
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,818
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

208
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,279
The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

209
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,323
I didn't know you were so into art.

210
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,535
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

211
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:51,456
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

212
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,335
And because you're under 18...

213
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,338
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

214
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,342
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

215
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:05,345
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

216
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,973
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

217
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,393
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.

218
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:18,859
- What?
- I'm not comfortable with this.

219
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,777
- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

220
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,114
- Dad, please.
- A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

221
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,491
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

222
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,660
Amanda's 19.

223
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,793
How about this?
How about if I go along?

224
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,796
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisible.

225
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,258
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

226
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,010
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

227
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,431
I'll think about it.

228
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,808
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

229
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,228
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

230
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,523
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

231
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:06,448
- I don't get you.
- What?

232
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,951
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

233
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,871
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

234
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,874
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

235
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,919
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- What's your problem?

236
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

237
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,551
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

238
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,012
You're pathetic.

239
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,197
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

240
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,493
BRYAN: Three conditions.

241
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,496
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

242
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:57,624
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

243
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,378
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

244
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,296
It's international. My number is in.

245
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,590
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

246
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,050
- I am.
- What did I say?

247
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:10,554
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

248
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,557
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

249
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,893
Okay, one last thing.
I get to take you to the airport.

250
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,562
Okay.

251
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,314
- There you go.
- Yes.

252
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,818
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

253
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,695
Mom!

254
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,781
I love you, Dad.

255
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,994
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go call Amanda!

256
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,500
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

257
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,296
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and I had talked about it first?

258
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,469
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
I've written them down.

259
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,888
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

260
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,850
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

261
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,728
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

262
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,938
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

263
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,815
Well, my job made me aware.

264
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:09,029
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

265
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,531
And she would tell me to ask you.

266
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:15,327
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

267
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,245
Yeah? Why?

268
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,916
I don't know. Maybe because...

269
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,752
...I was afraid to find out.

270
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,756
Like, maybe it was something
I wouldn't like.

271
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,259
I worked for the government.
You knew that.

272
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,014
So you were like a spy, right?

273
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:39,643
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

274
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:45,690
Well, no, I was a-- 
I was a preventer, actually.

275
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,692
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

276
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,028
What did you prevent?

277
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,197
Bad things from happening.

278
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:56,785
So it was a good job?

279
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,746
Yes. Yep, it was.

280
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,708
Do you miss it?

281
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,543
I missed you more.

282
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,936
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

283
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,938
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

284
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,379
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

285
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,964
Lenore.

286
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,967
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

287
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,303
- I know.
- She lied to me.

288
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,638
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

289
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,890
Why? What are you talking about?

290
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,726
Your rules and conditions.

291
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,185
What is this?

292
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,105
It's U2's European tour dates.

293
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,274
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

294
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:13,153
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

295
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,489
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

296
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:20,035
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

297
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,703
No idea what the world is like.

298
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,665
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

299
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,794
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

300
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:33,923
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

301
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,135
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

302
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:45,352
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

303
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,355
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

304
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,067
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

305
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,116
Girls.

306
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:06,915
Kim!

307
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:13,922

You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

You'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on...

Well, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we call you?

It doesn't matter what we call you...

...what does matter
is what you're doing here.

it's about the only rule we have.
