1
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,445
Another one?

2
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,198
Well, I'm still vertical,
so I'd like to change that.

3
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:24,876
Ho, ho.

4
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,964
Bitter. Pint.

5
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:31,925
You just get off?

6
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,932
I'm taking a break.

7
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,143
Between shifts,
I guess you could say.

8
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,103
You ain't driving,
are you?

9
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,907
I steer a little, but the
reindeer do most of the work.

10
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,154
This is my fourth year
as a Santa.

11
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,739
Ah.

12
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,823
How about you?

13
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,116
Lost count.

14
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,120
I forget why I started
doing it in the first place.

15
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,664
Same reason anybody
does anything.

16
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,208
The money.

17
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,002
Money. Money.

18
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,047
This whole planet
runs on greed.

19
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,012
It's the look on
the kiddies' faces, innit?

20
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,472
That's what
does it for me.

21
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,099
The look.
Yeah, that look.

22
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,603
Lasts about
two seconds.

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,897
As soon as they're
finished unwrapping,

24
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,441
they want
the next present,

25
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,110
they want
the next cool thing.

26
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,112
That's how
this world works.

27
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,239
And kids...
What kids have become.

28
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,576
They're just like
little junkies.

29
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,038
They're little shits.
They just demand.

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,665
They don't believe.

31
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,335
They just want,
crave, consume.

32
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,467
Maybe this is
my last year.

33
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,721
The last Christmas.

34
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,938
I can't stand seeing
another Santa in distress.

35
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,898
Put his
drinks on my tab.

36
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,108
Okay?
Yeah.

37
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,151
Very merry of you. Okay.

38
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,654
I better get going.

39
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,699
Presents aren't gonna
deliver themselves.

40
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,662
For your grandson.
Save me a trip.

41
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,997
It's that new video game.

42
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,875
It's <i>Astro Blaster,
Blaster Astro.</i>

43
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,168
I don't know.

44
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,461
Merry Christmas.

45
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,630
How'd he know
my grandson's name?

46
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,220
How'd he know I have a
grandson?

47
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,138
Oi! That door
leads to the roof.

48
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,223
Piss head.

49
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,600
Go easy on him.
It's Christmas.

50
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,106
Hey! You can't
be up here.

51
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,067
If you break your neck,
I'm the one...

52
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,214
My God.

53
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,097
It's...

54
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,350
Beauti...

55
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,899
Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

56
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,860
There she is.
Hello, muffin.

57
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,613
Let's go
see Grandma.

58
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,325
Ooh.

59
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,536
Merry Christmas.

60
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,456
Merry Christmas, Trudy.

61
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,833
Merry...

62
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:39,047
Merry Christmas, Daddy,
ya filthy animal.

63
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,508
She got to stay up late
and watch <i>Home Alone.</i>

64
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,343
Uh-huh.
It was so funny.

65
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,931
Yep.
That... That hurts.

66
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,349
All morning.
Okay...

67
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,309
Thank you.

68
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,937
For doing this.

69
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,022
I'm not doing it
for you.

70
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,485
It's Christmas!
Yeah!

71
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,840
Merry Christmas, AI.

72
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,216
Hi, Linda.
Merry Christmas.

73
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,010
Mr. Lightstone.
Hey, AI.

74
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,386
Hey, you back
there, Tru?

75
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,447
Yeah, I bet you're
excited for Christmas.

76
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,056
What did you
ask Santa for?

77
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,892
Not to work
on Christmas Eve.

78
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,269
Must've been naughty
this year, 'cause here I am.

79
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,331
Just make sure you let Santa
through the gates later, AI.

80
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,648
Yeah.
Have a merry one, now.

81
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,775
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, AI.

82
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,485
Merry Christmas, Tru.

83
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,154
Thank you, AI.
Yeah.

84
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,519
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

85
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,605
<i>Hope you're on
the nice list.</i>

86
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,317
That doesn't
go over there.

87
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,325
Excuse me.

88
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,331
What the hell is this?

89
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,417
You are the worst catering
company on the planet.

90
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,127
It's lengthwise,
not width.

91
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,337
Unbelievable.

92
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,730
Okay.

93
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,857
Hi. Hi, guys.
Merry Christmas.

94
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,110
Hi. I'm fine. Thank you so much.

95
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,408
I'll never get over the fact
that you grew up like this.

96
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,370
My therapist says I'll
never get over it, either.

97
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,330
I need a drink.

98
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,587
Hey, look at that.

99
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,807
Hi, Linda.

100
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,226
Hey.
How's it going, Alva?

101
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,603
You gained weight.

102
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,605
Looks
good on you, though.

103
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,524
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

104
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,317
'Sup, limp dick?

105
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,559
I got great feelings
about this Christmas.

106
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,032
You want to know why? Yeah.

107
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,825
'Cause I think
this is the year

108
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,744
that Mom's gonna
kick herself upstairs

109
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,371
and choose one of us
to start running the show.

110
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,625
And I got to tell you, Jason,
that I'm gunning for your ass.

111
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,896
What would a Lightstone
family Christmas be

112
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,589
without groveling
and infighting?

113
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,550
Your rosé,
ma'am.

114
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,261
Honey, smile.
It's Christmas.

115
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,056
Good. Good girl.

116
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,936
I am sorry
about my sister.

117
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,027
It is really
nice to see you.

118
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,655
To have you here.

119
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,662
Okay, I'm behind. Catch
me up on all the hot goss.

120
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,291
Hot goss. Okay. Um...

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,586
Well, you remember Bert,
my sister's pride and joy.

122
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,298
Yo, yo, yo.
This is the Bert Locker

123
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,635
living that bling life
on Christmas Eve.

124
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,596
Hashtag blessed.

125
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,599
He just got
what I can only assume

126
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,352
will be his first of many
sexual harassment accusations.

127
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,395
Mom paid off the school,

128
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,689
and now the gymnasium
is named after us.

129
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,024
Of course she did.

130
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,317
What about
Tragic Mike?

131
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,069
All I'm saying is,

132
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,946
if I was on one
of those planes,

133
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,341
9/11 would've ended
with a bunch of terrorists

134
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,618
skydiving over Connecticut
without their parachutes.

135
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,412
Yes. Yes. Boom.
Yeah. You like that?

136
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,914
Yeah, I do like it.

137
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,166
Kiss me in front of my son. Now?

138
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,338
He might actually be
a decent actor.

139
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,629
He's been doing
an Oscar-worthy job

140
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,777
of pretending to find my
sister appealing.

141
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,095
Now he wants Mom
to fund a film for him.

142
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,491
Not a chance.
That's not gonna work for me.

143
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,392
- It's Gertrude!
- It's Mom.

144
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,352
Okay, let's do this.
Okay, okay. Come on.

145
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,038
Come on. Bert, get over
here. No. Mom. Mom!

146
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,522
Positions.
Game time, buddy.

147
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,707
Okay. Okay.
This is my good side.

148
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,584
I'm busy. We've
gone over this! Come on!

149
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,651
Gosh. Okay.

150
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,254
Bert,
get in the middle.

151
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,529
So it begins.

152
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,507
Seriously, come. You
know what that means.

153
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,491
Shall we
jockey forward?

154
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,617
No.

155
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,871
No, we can hang back.

156
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,081
Yeah.

157
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,125
Trudy, honey?

158
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,170
Come on over here.

159
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,339
Just, like...

160
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,734
Threaten
'em or bribe 'em.

161
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,135
This isn't
rocket science.

162
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,678
Same shit
we always do.

163
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,014
That's what?

164
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,600
That's the best
you can do?

165
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,518
Excited to see
your grandma?

166
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,895
Listen,
you cocksucker.

167
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,855
It's Christmas,
so why don't you take

168
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,815
your best offer,
gift wrap it,

169
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,776
and ram it up
your fucking box.

170
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,488
Maybe you don't
realize who I am.

171
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,133
Those were Grandma words.
You know, forget them.

172
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,885
Oh, boy. Look
at Mr. Cool back here.

173
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,952
Yeah, what's your
angle, man, hmm?

174
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,622
No angle.
I'm not doing anything.

175
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,207
Oh, yeah.

176
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,185
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. No!

177
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,794
Don't shit in my mouth and
tell me it's chocolate cake.

178
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,588
Grandma's cool.

179
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,566
I can make
that story go away...

180
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,234
I think your brother's
up to something.

181
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,885
No, I just decided
to let you guys

182
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,871
have all the fun
sucking up to Mom today.

183
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,473
Please. You are
King Suck-up.

184
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,642
You named
your kid Gertrude.

185
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,145
Alva, you named
your son Bertrude.

186
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,897
Okay.

187
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,857
Sorry, Bert, but
that's not a real name.

188
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,818
Sorry, Linda. We can't all be
lucky enough to have daughters.

189
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,153
Mom, I can hear you.

190
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,366
You know something
we don't. What is it?

191
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,034
No, I don't. I don't.

192
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,327
I got it. Bingo.

193
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,662
I'm onto you, man.
Come on!

194
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,330
We were just...
Come on,

195
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,665
come on.

196
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,250
You big sack of shit.

197
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,216
Ooh. No wonder
your husband left you.

198
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,754
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

199
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,341
Merry Christmas to you,
too, Senator.

200
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,386
Merry Christmas, Mommy.
Merry Christmas.

201
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,638
Merry Christmas.

202
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,599
Why in the hell are you
standing all the way back there?

203
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,477
Merry Christmas,
Grandma!

204
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,812
- Little bitch.
- Aw.

205
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,065
Little Gertrude. And how is
my favorite granddaughter?

206
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,442
Everybody calls me
Trudy now.

207
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,528
Trudy?

208
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,864
That makes her sound
like a whore. Okay.

209
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,510
Oh, she doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

210
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,703
I'm starving. Let's eat.

211
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,079
Great.

212
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,665
And, Mom, I think
Gertrude is a beautiful name.

213
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,042
Mm-hmm.
I only call her Gertrude.

214
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,603
Merry Christmas, Gertrude.
Come on, Bertrude.

215
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,034
Whoo-hoo!

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,736
Another fucking Christmas.

217
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,200
I made these
all by myself.

218
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,868
No way.

219
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,412
I even made one
that looks exactly like Santa.

220
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,748
Exactly.
Yeah.

221
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,708
Santa gets
a candy cane, too?

222
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,043
Yeah.

223
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,211
Okay.

224
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,464
It's perfect.

225
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,049
No peeking.

226
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,261
This house has so many
chimneys.

227
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,347
How will Santa know
which one to come down?

228
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,973
Oh, Santa just knows.

229
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,683
Christmas magic.

230
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,688
Honey, what's wrong?

231
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,817
Daddy never took me to see
Santa at the mall this year.

232
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,361
He didn't.

233
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,782
I am so sorry.

234
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,286
This year has been weird.

235
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,915
I never got to tell Santa
what I wanted for Christmas.

236
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,418
Oh, honey.
Come here.

237
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,423
You know what?

238
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,593
You go put
your pj's on,

239
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,931
and I will be
two minutes.

240
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,105
Yes!

241
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,985
Okay...

242
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,453
Yes.

243
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,583
Yes!

244
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:05,214
Because you have been so
good to me and Mommy this year,

245
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,177
we decided that
you could have one gift...

246
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,012
Early!

247
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,555
Really?

248
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,353
What is it?

249
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,442
That is a very special
walkie-talkie.

250
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,611
It's magic.

251
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,112
Magic?
Mm-hmm.

252
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,822
What you got
right there

253
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,742
is a direct hotline
to Santa Claus himself.

254
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,494
I can talk to Santa?

255
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:39,165
Oh, yeah. It's just like
writing him a letter, but better.

256
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,500
Mm. Mm.

257
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,044
Now, the only
thing is,

258
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,505
he might not have time
to answer you.

259
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,798
He's delivering a lot
of presents tonight.

260
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:48,925
Mm-hmm.

261
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,385
But he'll hear everything
you want to say to him.

262
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,644
Hello, Santa?

263
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,104
This is Trudy Lightstone.

264
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,233
I hope you're having
a nice night.

265
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,572
It's really cold tonight, so
don't forget your mittens.

266
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,160
So, I wanted
to tell you, Santa,

267
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,287
I was extra
good this year,

268
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,124
so I wrote a big list for you
with all the stuff I wanted.

269
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,710
But then...

270
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,798
Then I realized I
don't need any of that.

271
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,135
I really only want
one present for Christmas.

272
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,390
I want Mommy and Daddy
to make up

273
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,977
so we can be
a family again.

274
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,521
Okay.

275
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,606
Good night, Santa.

276
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,026
Good night,
Mr. Bunny.

277
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,916
Which one of you
did that?

278
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,603
You can't go
two seconds without

279
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,674
crapping on the roof
like a bunch of pigeons?

280
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,592
So unprofessional.

281
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,347
You know, Rudolph
will never do this crap.

282
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,945
Hmm.

283
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,868
Mm.

284
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,044
Mm, mm.

285
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,630
Homemade.

286
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,090
Mm.

287
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,930
Ugh. Skim.

288
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:11,984
Oh, yeah.

289
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,653
That's the stuff.

290
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,953
Dubois.

291
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,998
That's some prewar
shit right there.

292
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,084
Good shit.

293
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,306
Mm.

294
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,766
That pairs well.

295
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,227
What do we have here?

296
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,869
Oh, yeah.

297
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,913
That's the stuff.

298
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,133
You know...

299
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,845
Christmas
is all right,

300
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,974
but you Americans don't
celebrate my favorite holiday.

301
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,560
Yeah? What?

302
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,270
Boxing Day.

303
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,513
Yo, yo.
B. Lightstone here,

304
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,220
live streaming the
dream, you know.

305
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,726
They say
the richest man...

306
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,312
Say goodbye.

307
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:12,897
And if you...

308
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,568
Grandma! Your Wi-Fi
sucks dick.

309
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,986
Damn it!

310
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,864
When he was small,
I begged you to beat him.

311
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,467
Hey. Merry Christmas.

312
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:43,267
Or should I say
"Happy holidays" now?

313
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,805
Right? I mean, it's like,
people, make up your minds.

314
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,407
You know what I'm
saying? Can I help you?

315
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,350
Yeah. I sure
hope so. See...

316
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,143
My car broke down
a little ways...

317
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,395
Out here? This is
a private road.

318
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,897
You're telling me.

319
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,750
It's the first place
I've seen for miles.

320
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:57,983
I think I got frostbite.

321
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,610
Where the hell
am I, anyway?

322
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,654
G.T. Lightstone
family compound.

323
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,988
I'll call you a tow.

324
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,375
All right, revelers.

325
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,126
<i>Time to steal Christmas.</i>

326
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,461
<i>Sound off.</i>

327
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,921
Jingle. Check.

328
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,673
Peppermint. Check.

329
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,841
Sugarplum. Check.

330
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,052
Krampus. Ready
to fuck shit up.

331
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,054
Candy Cane. Check.

332
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,598
Go for Frosty.
Go for Tinsel.

333
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,475
Go for Gingerbread.

334
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,978
Are we gonna use these
stupid code names all night?

335
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,855
<i>'Tis the season.</i>

336
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,899
Welcome to your worst
Christmas ever.

337
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,945
Trudy loves seeing
Santa at the mall.

338
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,573
She loves going
with her father.

339
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,259
And you should've
taken her yesterday,

340
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,868
like you do
every Christmas,

341
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,428
but we didn't even
hear from you.

342
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,763
Mom put me on
a special project.

343
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,205
It's complicated.
But it's not,

344
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,291
because it keeps happening
over and over.

345
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,835
Your mother forcing herself
between us. You're right.

346
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,734
What if we could give Trudy
her Christmas wish?

347
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:06,987
You're trying
to win me back

348
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,179
with a romantic weekend
at your mother's?

349
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,474
What if things really
changed this time?

350
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,854
We got out from under
my mother's thumb.

351
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,856
We'll walk away.

352
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,108
From the company,
the family.

353
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,613
Tonight.

354
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,115
What are you up to?

355
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,705
Let's go. We need
to get you out of here.

356
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,582
Mommy, where
are you going?

357
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,924
She's going for the
panic room! What?

358
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,309
Yes. Go, Bertrude.
Without us?

359
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,551
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

360
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,718
There isn't
room for all of us.

361
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,637
She can fit at least two
of us. Mom, take me.

362
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,579
Mom!
Oh, yeah.

363
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,289
Mom, can Bert
come, too?

364
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,269
Okay. Move it
or lose it, son.

365
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,795
Move it!
Whoa, whoa.

366
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,964
You're supposed
to protect us.

367
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,392
We protect
the primary asset.

368
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,762
Who the hell
are you?

369
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,515
You can call me
Mr. Scrooge.

370
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:18,684
Hilarious.

371
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:19,935
Get him.

372
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,196
Bah humbug, motherfucker.

373
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,874
Hey. Step aside.

374
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,336
Tinsel, Peppermint,
sweep upstairs.

375
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,714
I want all the
Lightstones together.

376
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,258
Kill anybody else
you find.

377
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,937
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

378
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:07,232
Trudy, honey,
we got to go.

379
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,277
Wake up, honey.
Wake up.

380
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,868
Maybe we can get out the
back by the servants' stairs.

381
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,955
Come on.
Not now. Not now.

382
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,042
Fuck! Fuck!

383
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,711
Mistletoe,
gingerbread.

384
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,152
Hey!

385
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,741
Hi.

386
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,910
You got me.

387
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,371
I don't want
any trouble, okay?

388
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,123
Downstairs. Now.

389
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,335
Look, mister, I don't
want to get involved.

390
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,587
I just have a job to do.

391
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,880
Okay? That's it.

392
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,049
I'm just gonna
take my bag,

393
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,010
and I'm just gonna
scooch up that chimney.

394
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,430
Enough talk. Let's go.

395
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,100
You don't want
to do this.

396
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,393
What? This?

397
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,437
Now, move!

398
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,940
Are you deaf?

399
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,150
Fucking move!

400
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,037
No, no, no.

401
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,790
No! Wait!

402
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,709
Wait.

403
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,460
Wait! Don't go!

404
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:52,254
Come back!

405
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:08,914
Fuck!

406
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,648
Oh, shit.

407
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,423
Damn chickenshit reindeer
leave me here to die.

408
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,393
<i>Violent night</i>

409
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,479
<i>Gory night</i>

410
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,940
<i>All is calm</i>

411
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:20,902
<i>If all doesn't want to get
Shot in the fucking head</i>

412
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,904
Cute.

413
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,116
Do you have any idea
who you're fucking with?

414
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,289
I know exactly
who I'm fucking with.

415
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,583
Wait, wait.
Did you actually think

416
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,209
that I spent months

417
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,004
planning a complex break-in
to the most secure

418
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,630
private residence
in the country

419
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,299
and I didn't know
who lived here?

420
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,759
Well, you're wrong.

421
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,136
'Cause your staff
are dead.

422
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,388
Your security are dead.

423
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,975
Now, sit down
and shut the fuck up!

424
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,339
Fuck.

425
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,733
We planned it.
It's all right.

426
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,363
It'll be solved
in a couple minutes.

427
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,638
Better be solved.

428
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,195
So much like a scene from
my movie <i>Dark Ransom.</i>

429
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,642
Oh, my God.

430
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,353
If they didn't
have guns,

431
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,390
I could take out three,
maybe four of them.

432
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,273
Try all of them.

433
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,026
Ew, Mom. Yuck.

434
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,129
If you'd really done your
research, you'd know

435
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,697
that my brother Rory
was kidnapped in the '70s.

436
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,784
But my father never
called the police.

437
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,829
Dad sent in our own
private extraction team,

438
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,415
and Rory was home safe
and sound a week later.

439
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,918
And the kidnappers
were never found.

440
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,379
If you get me.

441
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,007
I know.

442
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,927
I know all about
your extraction team

443
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,863
that you affectionately
call "the Kill Squad"

444
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,389
behind closed doors.

445
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,641
I also know that
they're on their way

446
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,744
and how long it's gonna
take 'em to get here.

447
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,312
I even know their credit
ratings and their dick sizes.

448
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,522
If you get me.

449
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,233
Then you should also know
you're already dead.

450
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,110
We don't do ransoms.

451
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,696
Again, I know. I know.

452
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,698
See, I know a lot,
Gertrude.

453
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,074
I really do.

454
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,703
Like the fact that you have
300 million in U.S. dollars

455
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,456
sitting in your personal
vault downstairs.

456
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,957
The fuck?
That's right.

457
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,877
300 million that
the U.S. government

458
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:45,464
gave Lightstone to quietly
distribute in the Middle East

459
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,299
to all the worst people,

460
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,261
to grease the wheels and
keep that sweet oil flowing.

461
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:55,807
300 million that... Oops...
Disappeared in the fog of war.

462
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,435
Except it didn't really
disappear, did it, Gerty?

463
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,145
'Cause you stole it.

464
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,688
Did you know about this?

465
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,981
Man, this family.

466
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,942
This moneygrubbing
family.

467
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,278
Clinging desperately
to your wealth,

468
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,715
when your poor employees
don't even have enough coal

469
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,199
to keep
Tiny Tim warm.

470
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,469
What is it with you and
all this Christmas shit?

471
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,329
Talk all you want.

472
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,414
You'll never
get in the vault.

473
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,792
Oh, oh, oh. Because when
you hit the panic button,

474
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,586
it reset
the combination?

475
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,589
I keep telling you,
I know.

476
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:36,014
This is what breaking
into a vault has turned into?

477
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,519
Remember when you just had
to drill holes and blow shit up?

478
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,288
I don't know,
maybe I'm getting old,

479
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,123
but there was something
romantic about that.

480
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,042
<i>Boss, you copy?</i>

481
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,484
I'm kind
of busy here.

482
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,486
<i>You're gonna
want to see this.</i>

483
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,039
Maybe he fell.

484
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,100
You rappel down
buildings with him.

485
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,124
You gonna tell me
he just fell out a window?

486
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,588
All right, look lively,
gang. We got a gopher.

487
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,439
You know what?

488
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,860
Um, I think Mr. Bunny
wants to go to sleep.

489
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,862
So, let's tuck him in.

490
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,030
Okay?

491
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,075
It's gonna be okay.

492
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,800
Hello? Santa?

493
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,468
Are you there?

494
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,684
Shit.

495
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,191
<i>This is Candy Cane
at checkpoint three.</i>

496
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,570
Shit. Shit. Shit.

497
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,283
Video game.

498
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,119
Video game.

499
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,538
Didn't anybody ask
for a bat or a sword

500
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,041
or Molotov cocktails?

501
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,343
Wait.

502
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,485
<i>Mommy, I love you.</i>

503
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,029
Poetry book.

504
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,907
<i>Die Hard</i>
on Blu-ray. Fuck!

505
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,256
Safety's on, dipshit.

506
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,936
Wait. Hang on. Hang on.

507
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,856
Wait, wait, wait. Look.

508
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,400
I don't want to kill you.

509
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:41,116
Well, a big fat guy,
gray beard.

510
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,994
Santa...

511
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,747
I'm gonna rip
your fucking balls off.

512
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,512
Shit.

513
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,494
Oh, God.

514
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,996
Ooh.

515
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,290
Ooh.

516
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,668
Ooh.

517
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,854
<i>This is Candy Cane checking in.</i>

518
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,630
<i>Compound is clear
and secured.</i>

519
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,666
<i>Copy. What's
the status on the Kill Squad?</i>

520
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,863
<i>Kill Squad
won't be here for two hours.</i>

521
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,632
<i>So we're doing good. The outer
seal's already been breached.</i>

522
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,642
Is there a 911 thing
on here?

523
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,520
My...

524
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,522
Am I doing that correct?

525
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,940
Hello?

526
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,525
Hello, can anybody
hear me?

527
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,333
<i>Can you
hear me, Santa?</i>

528
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,406
Hello?

529
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,074
Santa?

530
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,829
Yeah, this is Santa.

531
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,792
I hope I'm not
bothering you.

532
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,589
Daddy said you were
very busy tonight.

533
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,844
I'm... I'm on a break.

534
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,430
Who am I speaking to?

535
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,143
My name is Trudy Lightstone,

536
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,604
<i>and I've been
very good this year.</i>

537
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,398
Trudy...

538
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,319
Trudy Lightstone.

539
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:14,787
Yeah, Trudy.

540
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,665
You're on my nice list.

541
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,251
You've been a very
good girl this year.

542
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,880
<i>Where are you now, Trudy?</i>

543
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,551
I'm in a big room
with all my relatives.

544
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,638
There's two bad men
with guns watching us.

545
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,434
Oh, no. Six left.

546
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,227
<i>Are you gonna
help us, Santa?</i>

547
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,731
Yeah. Of course
I'm gonna help you.

548
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,192
I'm gonna get you
out of there.

549
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:47,737
<i>Take all these bad guys
on my naughty list...</i>

550
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,407
I'm gonna take
a lump of coal,

551
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,286
each and every one of them,
and shove it straight up...

552
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,537
The ass.

553
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,167
I mean, come on, sweetie.

554
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,795
We want to keep you
on the nice list, you know.

555
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,757
Sorry. Can I say
"butthole," then?

556
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,842
I mean, it's borderline.

557
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,886
How about "anus"?

558
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:16,265
Technically, yes,
"anus" is the tech...

559
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,059
Okay, look, Trudy.

560
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,770
<i>I got to call for help,
and the phone lines are down.</i>

561
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,189
You probably know this
house better than anybody.

562
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,233
You got any suggestions?

563
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,526
<i>I have an idea.</i>

564
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,924
All right, you're telling me
there's a goddamn Santa Claus

565
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,157
running around here?

566
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,808
Okay, well, he looks jolly as
fuck, but who the hell is he?

567
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,768
There's no Santa listed
on the employee manifest.

568
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,168
Yeah, there's more.

569
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,337
Frosty hasn't checked in.
I can't reach him.

570
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,672
All right, keep trying.

571
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,042
All right,
it's official.

572
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,071
We got a gopher on the
loose, and he's dangerous.

573
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,221
Watch your backs.

574
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,729
AI? AI?

575
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:11,029
Oh, shit.

576
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:20,580
Oh, shit!

577
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,666
<i>Frosty,
what's your status?</i>

578
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,130
<i>Frosty, sound off.</i>

579
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,424
Uh...

580
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,051
Frosty?

581
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,847
<i>Is that... Is that the naughty
guy I met in the basement?</i>

582
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,432
<i>Your friend is dead.</i>

583
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,769
He got a star in his face,
then his head caught on fire.

584
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,645
It's a long story.

585
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,481
Oh.

586
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,692
Is this our Santy?

587
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,612
Is this our
Santy Claus?

588
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:53,988
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

589
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,824
To whom am I speaking?

590
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:58,951
Well, for tonight,
I'm Mr. Scrooge.

591
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:02,830
Now, what is it that
you want exactly, Santa?

592
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,416
<i>I want you to put
down your weapons,</i>

593
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,419
<i>I want you to let
this family go,</i>

594
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:10,439
and then I want
to find my reindeer,

595
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,557
and I want to continue
delivering my presents.

596
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,011
Are you
fucking with me?

597
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,347
<i>All right, who the hell
are you really, huh?</i>

598
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,992
Some security guard who's
watched too many action flicks?

599
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,477
<i>Some loser ex-cop
stuck in a mall</i>

600
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,622
<i>playing dress-up with fat
kids pissing on your lap?</i>

601
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,106
<i>Stop me when
I get it right.</i>

602
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,191
It's a little more
complicated than that.

603
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,943
Not to me, it's not.

604
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,088
'Cause I want to make it
my personal mission,

605
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:38,366
my holiday to-do list,
to find you and to end you

606
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,953
and to wipe my ass with you
and this whole fucking holiday.

607
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,622
That's what I want
for Christmas, Santa.

608
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,543
That is a terrible thing
to want for Christmas.

609
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,255
<i>But maybe you and I should
discuss that in person.</i>

610
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,008
Santa Claus
is coming to town.

611
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:09,188
Shit.

612
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,491
All right,
who did you hire

613
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,743
to play Santa at your
Christmas party, huh?

614
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,664
I said, who's playing Santa at
your fucked-up Christmas party?

615
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,041
I didn't hire a Santa.

616
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,836
I never have a Santa.
It's tacky.

617
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,713
So, who is he?

618
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,092
Huh?

619
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,385
Who is he?

620
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,137
Somebody better
start talking,

621
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,347
or I'm gonna bash
her brains in with this...

622
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:48,394
Damn, Gertrude. You really
got a thing for nutcrackers, huh?

623
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:53,983
So, I'm gonna torture
everyone in your family

624
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,861
until you tell me who's
running around your mansion

625
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,530
playing Santa
and fucking with my shit.

626
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,532
And who should
I pick first?

627
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,492
Should I go by age?

628
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,454
Or should I go by IQ?

629
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,832
Pick Jason.
He's my mom's favorite.

630
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,709
Yep. Him.
The one in the sweater.

631
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,295
All right.
Jason Lightstone it is.

632
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,630
The number one son.
No.

633
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:17,048
Wait. No,
we don't need...

634
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:18,650
We don't need to do that.
No, it's okay.

635
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,509
No. We don't
need to do this.

636
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:21,802
No.

637
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,429
Don't.

638
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,765
No, don't... Put it...
Don't... No.

639
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,030
No, no, no. CANDY CANE:
Give me this fucking...

640
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,654
I'm telling you,
no one hired a Santa.

641
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:41,197
All right.
You're right.

642
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,424
You're right.
Let's stop it.

643
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,450
What are we doing here?
Come on.

644
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,495
What are we, amateurs?
We're half-assing this.

645
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:50,581
Come on. It's not
called a finger cracker.

646
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:53,626
Okay, Candy Cane.

647
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,187
Stick one of his bozaks
in there.

648
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:56,421
I'm not touching
his balls.

649
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,106
What, are you
a princess all of a sudden?

650
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,851
I've seen you
scoop out brains before.

651
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,193
You want
me to scoop his brains out,

652
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,653
I'll scoop his brains
out right now,

653
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,862
but I'm not
touching his junk.

654
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,179
I don't care who does it.

655
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,839
I better be looking
at flat balls,

656
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:08,057
like, in
three seconds.

657
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:09,850
I'll do it.

658
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:11,936
Krampus. Perfect.

659
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,396
Not that guy.
Not that guy.

660
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,208
That's what I love about sociopaths.
Always up for trying new things.

661
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,626
You don't need
to do this, okay?

662
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,485
No, it's all
right. No.

663
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,904
No. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

664
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,323
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

665
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,493
Put your nuts in.

666
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:29,036
Yummy, yummy.

667
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,539
Stop hurting my daddy,

668
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:33,874
or Santa will get mad.

669
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:37,295
Oh. What a cutie.

670
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,648
So, what do we know
about Santa, little one?

671
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,149
She doesn't know
anything about Santa.

672
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,426
He wasn't asking you.

673
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,345
She's playing
make-believe.

674
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,389
She's pretending
to talk to Santa.

675
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,641
It's not pretend.
Santa's my friend,

676
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,301
and he said he's going
to save us.

677
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,561
No.

678
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,813
- And beat you up.
- Oh, is he?

679
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,108
I bet he'd come out of hiding
if you asked him to, huh?

680
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,169
What do you say
you come with me

681
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,629
and we play a little game
with him? - No.

682
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,755
Trudy, come on.
Tell him the truth now.

683
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,465
You aren't talking
to Santa. Yes, I am.

684
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,866
No, you're not.
Come on, now.

685
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,368
Yes, I am. Damn it,
Trudy, Santa isn't real!

686
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,378
I'm sorry, honey.

687
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,631
Santa's just a thing
adults tell kids

688
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,300
to make them
feel better, okay?

689
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,196
Your mommy and I give
you the presents,

690
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,973
and we say
they're from Santa.

691
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,894
He's not coming to
save us. He doesn't exist.

692
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,688
It's all made-up.

693
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:41,067
Really?

694
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,737
Aw. What a way
to find out that there's no Santa.

695
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,932
Hey, let's come back Easter and
ruin the Easter Bunny for her, too.

696
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,284
Trudy!
Come back here!

697
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,470
- Stop her!
- Trudy!

698
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,347
Hey! CANDY CANE:
You idiots, stay at your posts.

699
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,538
Trudy!

700
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,374
I'll find this
little brat.

701
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,973
<i>Santa. Santa!</i>

702
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,475
<i>Santa!</i>

703
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,228
<i>This is Trudy.</i>

704
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,898
<i>Are you okay, Santa?</i>

705
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,944
Hi. Hey.

706
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,237
<i>Are you okay?</i>

707
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,198
I'm good.

708
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,450
I was just wrapping
something up.

709
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,328
I ran away and hid
in the attic.

710
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,497
Okay. If you're safe,

711
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,626
just stay there and
stay quiet, all right?

712
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:08,380
Okay. I can set up booby
traps, like in <i>Home Alone.</i>

713
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:10,108
Okay, I don't know
what that means,

714
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,634
but, yeah, do that.

715
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,010
<i>Just do it quietly.</i>

716
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,972
Are you really Santa?

717
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:22,311
Of course I am,
sweetheart.

718
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,190
My daddy says
there isn't any Santa.

719
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,320
He says parents just tell
their kids that Santa's real

720
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,905
to make them feel better.

721
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,783
<i>He said they give us presents</i>

722
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,535
<i>and say they're from Santa.</i>

723
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,453
Yeah.

724
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,039
Yeah, a lot
of parents say that.

725
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,001
But I still bring presents
to kids that need me.

726
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,421
<i>Kids who really believe.</i>

727
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,801
How do you know
who really needs you?

728
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,595
Christmas magic.

729
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,764
I'm not really sure
how it works.

730
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,898
But, uh...

731
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,444
I remember

732
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,115
when Trudy Lightstone
wrote to me.

733
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,717
<i>She must have been
about six years old,</i>

734
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,079
<i>and she said that
she felt lonely sometimes.</i>

735
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:24,248
<i>She missed having
a best friend.</i>

736
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,960
<i>And so I brought her a
beautiful little stuffed rabbit.</i>

737
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,420
Mr. Bunny.

738
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,422
<i>And then I remember
the next year,</i>

739
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,549
and you said you had
this amazing dream

740
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:37,344
and that, afterwards,
all you wanted to do was...

741
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,887
To fly!

742
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,973
To fly. To fly.

743
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:46,854
I mean, Santa might have
some magic, but...

744
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,441
Making a little girl fly?

745
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,195
<i>But giving you a kite,</i>

746
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,199
<i>floating just beneath
the clouds,</i>

747
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,162
<i>well, it's about
as good as it gets.</i>

748
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:04,705
I knew it.

749
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,374
I knew you
were real, Santa.

750
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,421
Don't be too hard on
your parents, all right?

751
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:17,760
Grown-ups have a hard time
believing things.

752
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,037
Can you use
your Christmas magic

753
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,265
to make them love
each other again?

754
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,225
<i>I wish I had that
kind of power.</i>

755
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,146
Mrs. Claus and I have
been going on year...

756
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,607
1,100, and...

757
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,569
<i>Grown-up relationships
are complicated.</i>

758
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,364
It takes work.

759
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,824
A lot of work.

760
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:44,995
Do you still love her?

761
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,498
<i>Yeah, I do.</i>

762
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,919
But sometimes, even if you
want to make somebody happy...

763
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,464
...the magic
just goes away.

764
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,510
Hey.

765
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,970
I've got an idea.

766
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,514
This will be fun.

767
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:08,102
Why don't you guys
open your presents?

768
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,481
I want to see what you
rich assholes get each other.

769
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:17,236
And some of you might not
make it till tomorrow morning,

770
00:53:18,696 --> 00:53:21,115
so this could be
your only chance.

771
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,534
Come on.

772
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,536
Where's the
Christmas spirit?

773
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,873
Uh...

774
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:35,129
Gertrude, uh, I got you
something pretty special.

775
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,648
Did you
hear that, Gertrude?

776
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,507
He got you
something amazing.

777
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,384
What could it be?

778
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,721
Oh, my God,
this is exciting.

779
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:44,930
Mom.

780
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,516
Can I call you Mom?

781
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:50,519
Mrs. Lightstone.

782
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:55,649
Okay, so in the business,
they call this...

783
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:57,860
...a pitch deck.

784
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,353
- Pitch deck.
- Yeah.

785
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,989
It's called
<i>Explosive Force.</i>

786
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:03,657
Starring me.

787
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,242
And if you look
in the back,

788
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,912
there are the
financial numbers.

789
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,124
I'm kind of
a big deal in Asia.

790
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,502
Parts of Asia, at least.

791
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,963
We were in parts of
Asia once, and, like,

792
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,716
we couldn't even
go to a restaurant.

793
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:22,718
What is there
a better gift than

794
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,388
gift of a golden
opportunity?

795
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,188
Oh, no.

796
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,479
Granny doesn't like it.

797
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,148
Mother, I got you
something really special.

798
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:45,240
It's a sentimental photo
of the day I was born.

799
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,367
I remember.

800
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,786
I was there.

801
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,829
She
doesn't give a shit.

802
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,117
Swing and miss again!

803
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,460
This is so fun.

804
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,854
Mommy, how
about another one?

805
00:54:57,878 --> 00:54:59,338
I got you a lot
of good things.

806
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,381
I'll grab one.
Alva, sit down.

807
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,135
You've already
given me one. It's...

808
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,384
It's Jason's turn.

809
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,552
Uh...

810
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,515
I... I think I left it
in the car.

811
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,687
No, I saw you put one
under the tree earlier.

812
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,019
No. It's in the...
Yeah, I did.

813
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,189
I could've sworn.
You know what, it's...

814
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,233
You don't...
You don't...

815
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,110
It's this one, right?
Yeah, I got you, bro.

816
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,403
Come on.

817
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,657
Thank you.

818
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,785
It's my favorite whiskey.

819
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,162
You can skip the note.

820
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:57,896
Thank you, Jason.

821
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,737
What's the card say?

822
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,657
I think I'll just keep that
between Jason and I.

823
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,536
No one really needs
to know. Right, Jason?

824
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,582
Right.

825
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,252
<i>Did you ever have
a mommy and daddy?</i>

826
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,256
Yeah, of course
I had a mommy and daddy.

827
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,759
I wasn't... I wasn't
always Santa Claus.

828
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,387
<i>I had a life before this.</i>

829
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,224
A long, long,
long time ago.

830
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,564
They used to call me...

831
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,442
Nicomund.

832
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,114
<i>Nicomund the Red.</i>

833
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,618
<i>You had
a different job then?</i>

834
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:55,061
<i>Yeah,
you could say that.</i>

835
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,623
<i>I was a warrior.</i>

836
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,375
<i>A raider. A thief.</i>

837
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,211
<i>And if somebody
got in my way,</i>

838
00:57:04,296 --> 00:57:05,714
<i>me and Skullcrusher would...</i>

839
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,215
<i>Who's Skullcrusher?</i>

840
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,093
Skullcrusher's my...

841
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,638
My hammer.

842
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,682
My favorite hammer.

843
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,393
I was a surgeon
with that thing.

844
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,220
<i>Used to be able to take
three heads, line 'em up...</i>

845
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,982
<i>But why?</i>

846
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,777
What?

847
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,737
<i>Why'd you do those things?</i>

848
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,783
Because I was mean.

849
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,078
And I was greedy.

850
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,749
And I wanted gold, jewels.

851
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:44,145
<i>Yeah, I mean, if there was
a naughty list back then,</i>

852
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,796
<i>I'd be top dog.</i>

853
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,216
Well, maybe...

854
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:51,885
What?

855
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,971
<i>Maybe all those bad things
you used to do...</i>

856
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:58,350
Maybe you can use them
to do good things instead.

857
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:00,394
<i>To help.</i>

858
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:03,021
What do you mean?

859
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,150
Mr. Bunny,
he wasn't just a toy.

860
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,696
That night, you gave me
what I wished for.

861
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,156
A best friend.

862
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,576
<i>'Cause you're
good and kind.</i>

863
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,746
<i>And you mean more than just
the presents you bring.</i>

864
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,708
<i>That's why I believe
in you, Santa.</i>

865
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,876
<i>That's why I believe.</i>

866
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,467
Thank you.

867
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,723
<i>You stay hidden, Trudy,
till I come get you.</i>

868
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:40,350
Stay safe.

869
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,438
All right, we
got satellite confirmation.

870
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,356
Extraction team's
on the go.

871
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:48,900
ETA, 30 minutes.

872
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,318
We're on schedule.

873
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,029
Everything's good.

874
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,631
All right, fellas.

875
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,032
Look alive, look alive.

876
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,992
You all know the plan,

877
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,162
and I like my operations
like I like to fuck.

878
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,123
Hard and fast
with minimal cleanup.

879
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,586
Now, some idiot gets in
your way, what do you do?

880
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,671
Fuck their shit up right!

881
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,381
Damn right.

882
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,592
Time to lube up.

883
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,513
Let's go, motherfuckers!
Let's go!

884
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,521
This fucking family.

885
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,335
<i>Ho, ho, ho, ho.</i>

886
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,087
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

887
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,421
<i>Happy holidays.</i>

888
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,547
Traitor.

889
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,134
I got him
in the east wing.

890
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:57,945
<i>All right,
we're on our way. Hold him.</i>

891
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,568
Step aside.

892
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:32,295
Now, how did this tired,
old, fat piece of shit get the drop on us?

893
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,131
I don't know.

894
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,906
He's not even armed.

895
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,319
This bag is the only
thing he had on him.

896
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,594
What's in there?

897
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,347
Can't see anything.

898
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,405
Here,
give it to me.

899
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,533
What kind of moron

900
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,994
carries a chess
set with him?

901
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,583
What the fuck?

902
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,918
Doesn't make any sense.
Look at all this shit.

903
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,095
So, you're gonna tell us
what's the gimmick with the bag?

904
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:23,847
It's magic.

905
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,683
You put your hand in,
out comes a present.

906
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,742
I don't really understand
how it works, either.

907
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:35,483
So, you're Mr. Scrooge.

908
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,402
That's right.

909
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,987
But who are you?

910
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,406
Weihnachtsmann.

911
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,326
Julenissen.

912
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,537
Shèngdàn Laorén.

913
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,333
Babbo Natale, Père Noel,
Kris Kringle.

914
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,002
Jolly old Saint Nick.

915
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,338
People call me
a lot of things.

916
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,508
Very funny.

917
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,969
Or should I say,
"Ho, ho, ho"?

918
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:06,473
If you're Santa,
where's your reindeer?

919
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,475
They were on the roof

920
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,019
until that guy I turned
into an ice kebab just...

921
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,856
You don't believe me?

922
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:16,483
Go check.

923
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,236
Prancer left a tasty
log up there.

924
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,987
This fucking guy.

925
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,322
You don't think...

926
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,635
Now, I know you're an idiot,
but don't be an idiot out loud.

927
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,661
Come on, he's
just in Santy Claus

928
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,913
with a fucking
trick bag.

929
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,957
Oh, no!

930
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,708
That bag was full
of kids' dreams!

931
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,418
Oh, come on.

932
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,963
Everybody knows that
Christmas dreams are bullshit.

933
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,132
My father used to make
a big deal out of it

934
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,884
every Christmas.

935
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,303
Every freaking Christmas
with the presents

936
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,639
and the candy
and the decorations

937
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:51,226
and the Christmas caroling
and all that bullshit.

938
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,020
And then when I was...

939
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,691
I don't know, 10, 11,

940
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,360
he got laid off,
and that Christmas,

941
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,741
couldn't even
afford a tree.

942
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,446
No Christmas dinner,
no gifts.

943
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:05,865
Nothing, <i>nada, culo,</i> dick.

944
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:08,201
But our neighbors...

945
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,036
Our neighbors,
oh, they had it all.

946
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:13,832
I could see all that yuletide cheer
through their window, mocking me.

947
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,751
So Christmas Eve
rolls around, and...

948
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,839
I waited for everybody
to go to bed.

949
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,259
And then I snuck in there
to take it all.

950
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,823
Only problem was that the
gramps got up to take a piss

951
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:31,117
and the two of us scared
the shit out of each other.

952
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,269
And, he fell down
the stairs

953
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,647
and broke his neck,
and he died in the hospital.

954
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,544
Everybody thought that I did it,
and every time I tried to tell them,

955
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,069
I tried to tell
them that...

956
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,990
Anyway, maybe I did do it.

957
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,701
Maybe I did push him.

958
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,161
Poor old fucker.

959
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,998
So, you see,
Christmas ruined my life.

960
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,666
Okay?
But you know what?

961
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,043
It set me on the path

962
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,128
and made me the great
man that I am today.

963
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:01,546
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

964
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:04,299
I really am.

965
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,260
But I do gifts.
I do Christmas cheer.

966
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,637
I don't get involved
in people's lives.

967
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:13,141
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well,
maybe you fucking should!

968
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,774
Um, how did
he know your name?

969
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:22,776
Bjorn.

970
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:24,944
What's your excuse?

971
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,363
Huh?

972
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,532
Didn't I get you that Huffy
bike you wanted back in '82?

973
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,243
The one you wrote me
50 times about!

974
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,704
What about you, Kira?

975
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,707
You made your
brother eat worms.

976
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,292
That's naughty!

977
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,259
Okay, how does he know
about my bike?

978
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:44,756
It's a lucky guess, like,
"Hey, do you like big tits?"

979
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,966
Come on, every kid
wants a fucking bike.

980
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:50,095
You're gonna tell me who
you work for... Christ. No.

981
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,806
You've got five seconds to
tell me who you really are.

982
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,017
Five, four, three, two...

983
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,727
I'm Santa Claus!

984
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,270
Well, not anymore.

985
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:26,715
Is it snowing?

986
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,926
Is he
doing this with Santa magic?

987
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,852
Let it snow!

988
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,699
It's not snow.

989
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,117
It's Styrofoam.

990
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,244
I told you this
guy's a big phony.

991
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,218
Where'd he go?

992
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,387
He went up
the chimney.

993
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,073
I saw it. SCROOGE: I don't know,

994
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,016
he had a rig
or some pulley system

995
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,119
that just yanked him up.
You can't fit up there.

996
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,745
It's impossible.
You see one weird thing,

997
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,813
and then you think
you're in a fairy tale?

998
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,218
<i>Incoming. We've got
sleigh bells approaching.</i>

999
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,650
Oh, my God.

1000
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,235
It's his reindeer.

1001
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:33,740
It's the extraction team.

1002
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,408
Pull yourselves together!

1003
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,093
And that is the
sound of my Kill Squad.

1004
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,389
You're
fizzity-fucked now.

1005
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,100
Huh? What are you gonna
do? You little elf bitch.

1006
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,144
Bertie.

1007
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,562
Hashtag blessed.

1008
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,609
Yeah!

1009
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,402
Parkour.

1010
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,654
Kill him, babe!

1011
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,784
Morgan's
gonna save us.

1012
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,997
Jean-Claude Van Dipshit
just ditched us, sweetie.

1013
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,257
Hold your fire.

1014
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:33,800
Barrel roll!

1015
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,761
Easy, easy.

1016
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,721
Yeah!
Easy.

1017
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:40,014
Identify yourself.

1018
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,517
I'm one
of the hostages.

1019
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:45,520
Morgan Steel,
the actor.

1020
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,648
Played a lot of
soldiers in my career.

1021
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,901
Can I just say, thank you
for your service. <i>Semper fi.</i>

1022
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:54,862
What's the
situation inside?

1023
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:57,365
Bunch of
ex-military guys,

1024
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,468
but I got to warn you,
they know you're coming.

1025
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:00,952
I think they're
ready for you.

1026
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,370
They better be.

1027
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,330
We're on
a tight schedule.

1028
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,499
Shit.

1029
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,383
- All right, let's move out.
- Let's move out.

1030
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:20,930
Come on.

1031
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,600
You got to be
kidding me.

1032
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:26,311
Hey, Thorp, you're 10
minutes late. What kept you?

1033
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,105
Looks to me like your
net's got a hole in it.

1034
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,584
Or are you just letting your
hostages out for some exercise?

1035
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,776
No, no, no. We got a
wild gopher running around

1036
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:36,279
complicating shit
and causing problems.

1037
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:37,989
Who? Lightstone security?

1038
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,550
Nah, I don't think so. Some
intruder dressed as Santa.

1039
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:41,093
But I'm telling you,
I'm telling you,

1040
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,744
there's something
weird about him.

1041
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,287
Might be
the real Santa.

1042
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,182
The fuck did she just
say? - Nothing.

1043
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,249
She's joking.

1044
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,668
My squad will
take care of it.

1045
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,715
Beta Team,
go find this asshole.

1046
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,050
Go.

1047
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:02,096
Now, let's unwrap
our present, shall we?

1048
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:04,432
All right,
you heard the man.

1049
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:06,392
Time to kill Santa.

1050
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,187
I've got him.
He's on the roof.

1051
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,397
Roger that.
I got eyes on him.

1052
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,268
Right,
Sugarplum. Hit that button.

1053
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,676
Here we go.

1054
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,469
Our skeleton key.

1055
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,137
The "open"
magic stick.

1056
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,139
This better
fucking work.

1057
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,725
I'm flushing my career
for this, my reputation.

1058
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,269
Yeah, then you can
buy yourself a new rep.

1059
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,074
As a kid, I loved unwrapping
Christmas presents so much

1060
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,660
that my mom would wrap
empty boxes for me.

1061
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,996
I didn't care that
nothing was inside.

1062
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,636
Is this a fucking joke?

1063
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:24,887
No.

1064
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,375
You said it
would fucking be here!

1065
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,811
I'm telling you, my
intel was rock solid.

1066
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,980
I had guys
on the inside.

1067
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,860
300 million in cash was
delivered here yesterday

1068
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,945
to this
fucking mansion.

1069
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,494
Somebody must've
intercepted it.

1070
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,625
Son of a bitch.

1071
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,816
Shit.

1072
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,027
Santa, you okay?

1073
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,196
<i>Santa.</i>

1074
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:26,365
A bunch of new bad guys showed
up. They're on the naughty list.

1075
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,077
<i>They got their gadgets
and their gizmos on them.</i>

1076
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,498
I'm sorry. I think
this is it, kid.

1077
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,374
No, no, don't say that.

1078
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,709
<i>The naughty list...</i>

1079
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,587
It just grows and grows.

1080
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:52,183
He's in that structure.
Body cams on.

1081
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:53,768
<i>Don't give up.</i>

1082
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,562
<i>You make a wish
this time, Santa.</i>

1083
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,481
Just this once.

1084
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,108
If you could have
anything in this world,

1085
01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:03,528
what would it be?

1086
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,078
I wish I could see
Mrs. Claus again,

1087
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,081
tell her how
much I love her.

1088
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,584
Then you make
that wish come true.

1089
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,920
Shit.

1090
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,922
No, no.

1091
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,092
Oh, God.

1092
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:27,468
No.

1093
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,402
You said these guys,
they're naughty.

1094
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,904
<i>And what do you do
to the naughty ones?</i>

1095
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,990
I give them a lump of coal.

1096
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,409
Yeah. Give them their lumps.

1097
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,013
Take that coal and shove it
straight up their...

1098
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,206
Anuses.
Yeah!

1099
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,630
They're right outside.

1100
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,188
Santa's gonna eat
through these guys

1101
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,482
like a plate
full of cookies.

1102
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:29,572
Move, move.

1103
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,744
Hey, lock it up.

1104
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,164
Lights down.

1105
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:41,292
Stay at my back.

1106
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:43,961
All right,
we got this, boys.

1107
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,232
All right, where
the fuck is my money?

1108
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:07,151
Where's the money?

1109
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,123
All right, I've been
a sweetheart up to now.

1110
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:22,750
But that's all over.

1111
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,418
No more fucking games!

1112
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,087
Where's the money?

1113
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,756
Or I will shoot every last
one of you and enjoy it.

1114
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,972
It's in the vault.
I just looked in the vault.

1115
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:37,473
Had the money
been in there,

1116
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:39,159
I'd have a different
expression on my face.

1117
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,393
Impossible.

1118
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,645
Takes days to get
into that thing.

1119
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:46,148
Not if we have the key,
Mrs. Lightstone.

1120
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:48,818
Thorp.

1121
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:53,447
You can't trust anyone
these days.

1122
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,658
I'm not
sure how, but you

1123
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,244
or one of your shithead
kids moved the money.

1124
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,287
And this upsets me.

1125
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,415
It upsets me

1126
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:06,168
in a way that makes me want
to just randomly shoot at people.

1127
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:09,171
Hold on.
Just... Sorry.

1128
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:10,965
What? What?

1129
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,067
What if you randomly shoot the
only person who knows where it is?

1130
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,055
Oh, fuck you people!

1131
01:15:53,007 --> 01:15:54,258
Suck on this.

1132
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,951
I need some
feedback, guys.

1133
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:23,871
Guys, what the hell
is going on?

1134
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,835
Huh?

1135
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,167
Jesus Christ.

1136
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,713
Nope. Just jolly
old Saint Nick.

1137
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,436
Oh, God!
There you go.

1138
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:12,104
A little
stocking stuffer.

1139
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:16,567
Where is it?
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1140
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,111
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1141
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,655
I got to watch.
Fuck!

1142
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,201
Ho-Ho-Holy shit.

1143
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:30,206
Gertrude would never
trust anybody

1144
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,499
who wasn't blood
with this kind of info.

1145
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,709
So...

1146
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:36,837
The in-laws
wouldn't know shit,

1147
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:40,382
which means that
I can shoot her...

1148
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,112
...unless you tell me
where the fucking money is.

1149
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,096
Please don't,
okay? It's Christmas.

1150
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,514
Shut up!

1151
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,577
I swear, I'll blow
her brains out

1152
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:51,870
unless you tell me
where the money went.

1153
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,229
I did it!

1154
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,523
What?
Okay. Yeah, I did it.

1155
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,510
I moved the money.
No, don't be an idiot.

1156
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,195
What? The money's
our only leverage.

1157
01:19:00,236 --> 01:19:01,963
My wife has a fucking
gun to her head, so...

1158
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:03,882
Yeah, how did you find
out that we were coming?

1159
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,366
I didn't.
I was stealing it.

1160
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,178
- Yeah, coincidence.
- Oh, my God.

1161
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:10,120
I was planning
to take the money

1162
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:12,581
and leave with my wife
and daughter tonight

1163
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:13,999
and never come
back here.

1164
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,003
And then
my mom would

1165
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,148
read the note with her
whiskey in the morning

1166
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,715
and know
what I had done.

1167
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,134
For years, I have
been telling you

1168
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,595
to stop caring about your
mother's fucking money!

1169
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,807
And you think the solution
was to steal a bunch of it.

1170
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:34,270
Well, yeah, it does sound
stupid when you say it like that.

1171
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,313
How can you
do this right now?

1172
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,500
It's disgusting. After all
that Mother has given us?

1173
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,524
Come on, Alva. Everything
she ever gave you,

1174
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:41,777
she made damn
sure we knew

1175
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,577
she had the power
to take right back.

1176
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:46,907
I have spent years
groveling to you.

1177
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:49,618
In the meanwhile,
I was destroying

1178
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,745
the only good
thing in my life.

1179
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,348
What are
we doing here, huh?

1180
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:56,000
Family therapy
or doing a heist?

1181
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,627
Yeah, enough of
this sharing bullshit.

1182
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,629
All right.
Where'd you put it?

1183
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:08,804
Look at this
little idiot.

1184
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:14,935
Oh, no.

1185
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,478
What?

1186
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,605
<i>The bad guys found me.</i>
Okay.

1187
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,566
I'm coming.

1188
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,951
You know, booby traps don't
work unless you hide them.

1189
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:35,122
You little moron.

1190
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,586
Jesus! Shit!

1191
01:20:44,757 --> 01:20:46,508
Help me! Help me! Help!

1192
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:50,179
You'll be...
You'll be fine.

1193
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:52,627
Sit tight.
I'll be back in a sec.

1194
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,603
Right after I kill
this little piece of shit!

1195
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:02,649
You little fucking brat.

1196
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,908
You're dead!

1197
01:21:53,117 --> 01:21:54,868
You're so fucking dead!

1198
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:04,378
Fucking piece of shit.

1199
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,261
You little...

1200
01:22:30,821 --> 01:22:32,072
Incoming!

1201
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:53,677
Son of a fucking...

1202
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,104
Fuck.

1203
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,523
I got you now, kid.

1204
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,066
Yeah? Heads up.

1205
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,146
That's all you got?
You fucking...

1206
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,408
Enough of this shit.

1207
01:23:43,101 --> 01:23:44,144
Santa!

1208
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:48,565
Aw.

1209
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:55,989
Hi, Trudy.

1210
01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:59,243
I made booby traps like in
the movie. It was so funny.

1211
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:01,745
Ho, ho, ho.

1212
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:11,421
Trudy, I want you to...
Just do me a favor.

1213
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:15,467
Just turn around
and close your eyes.

1214
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,719
Maybe put your fingers
in your ears,

1215
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:21,056
and sing <i>Jingle Bells</i>
as loud as you can.

1216
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,600
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

1217
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:25,686
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

1218
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,980
<i>Oh, how fun it is to ride...</i>

1219
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:30,941
You were about to murder
an innocent child.

1220
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,210
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells...</i>

1221
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,235
Innocent?

1222
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:35,237
It's naughty.

1223
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:37,030
Naughty.

1224
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,366
Naughty!

1225
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:41,159
It's part of the
Lightstone legacy.

1226
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:42,661
We're horrible
people.

1227
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,746
So I get why you
did what you did.

1228
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,933
When your grandfather told
me I'd never run the company

1229
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:49,126
because a girl doesn't
have what it takes,

1230
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,503
I had to snatch the
reins away from him.

1231
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:52,671
But the point is,

1232
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:54,381
a Lightstone takes
what's theirs.

1233
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,049
I'm proud
of you, son.

1234
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,616
All right, where
the hell is it?

1235
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:01,388
The money's
hidden inside.

1236
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,018
And the Three
Wise Men presented him with gifts

1237
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:09,104
of frankincense, myrrh...

1238
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:14,067
...and cold hard cash.

1239
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:15,611
Load it up, boys.

1240
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,779
All right,
we're securing the money.

1241
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,823
Kill the hostages
and meet us outside.

1242
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:21,533
What?

1243
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,784
No.

1244
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:26,872
Mom.

1245
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,332
It's fine, Bert.

1246
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:29,666
Everything's fine.

1247
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,001
Okay.

1248
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,629
Everybody, get up.

1249
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:38,342
It's time
for a murder.

1250
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,969
Come on. You don't
want to kill us.

1251
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:42,262
You really don't.

1252
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:44,431
Oh, yes, I do.

1253
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,601
I really, really,
really do.

1254
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,186
And I'm gonna
start with you.

1255
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:51,480
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

1256
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,567
You got to kill
Aunt Linda first.

1257
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,027
What the hell, Bert?

1258
01:25:57,110 --> 01:26:00,697
You want to squeeze in being a
little shit before you die, Bertrude?

1259
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,357
I say shoot him
first. - What?

1260
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:04,326
Wait.
No. Don't shoot him.

1261
01:26:04,451 --> 01:26:06,498
Don't shoot him first.
And don't you call him

1262
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,789
a little shit,
you gold-digging bitch.

1263
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,582
Okay. I changed
my mind.

1264
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,602
Shoot the alcoholic bitch
first. Don't call my mom

1265
01:26:12,626 --> 01:26:14,103
an alcoholic bitch.
Your mom's an alcoholic.

1266
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:15,855
I'm sorry. You're a
gold-digging bitch.

1267
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:18,107
I'm a gold-digger, when I
have a whole-ass career?

1268
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,651
You're not even part
of the fucking family.

1269
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,302
She's an engineer.
You know goddamn well...

1270
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,637
Shut up!

1271
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:30,560
Just like rats
in a barrel.

1272
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:34,439
Why don't you die
with some dignity?

1273
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:41,196
Get off of me!

1274
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:42,864
Okay, okay.

1275
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,408
Fuck you!

1276
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,868
This is for yelling
at my child!

1277
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:48,370
Creep!

1278
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,170
That's for slapping me,
motherfucker!

1279
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,019
This is for
your dumb fucking hat!

1280
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:02,843
Is he...

1281
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:04,845
Is he dead?

1282
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,016
Yeah.

1283
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,145
Thanks, Linda.

1284
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:16,334
Well, it's nice to do something
as a family for a change.

1285
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:19,067
Oh, shit!

1286
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:20,944
I'm gonna...

1287
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:26,700
That was
for Morgan.

1288
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:31,455
He may have been stupid,
but he was very, very hot.

1289
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:35,333
Trudy!

1290
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,668
Mommy!

1291
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:39,463
Thank God, baby.

1292
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:41,381
Oh. Are you okay?

1293
01:27:41,882 --> 01:27:43,091
I'm okay, Mommy.

1294
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,259
Okay.

1295
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,803
This is my
friend, Santa.

1296
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,934
What the fuck?

1297
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:55,061
I can't thank you
enough, Mister...

1298
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:57,731
Claus. But please
call me Santa.

1299
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:58,982
Mm-hmm.

1300
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,735
You guys should get out
of here. It's dangerous.

1301
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:04,529
They took my husband
and her grandmother.

1302
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,301
Anybody know how
to work these gizmos?

1303
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,576
I think so.

1304
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,036
I used to hunt
with my dad.

1305
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:12,496
Ow.

1306
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:14,331
Copy that.
How's that looking?

1307
01:28:14,456 --> 01:28:15,808
Yeah,
I got it on lockdown.

1308
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,143
Heads on
a swivel, boys.

1309
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:19,907
- Incoming!
- Heads up!

1310
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,714
Who's shooting?

1311
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:26,301
Cap, get down!

1312
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,976
Gun 'em down.
Mow them all down.

1313
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,846
Let's get the
fuck out of here. Let's go.

1314
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,248
Go where? Come
on, move, you old bat.

1315
01:28:57,207 --> 01:28:58,696
Get your fucking
hands off of me.

1316
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:09,511
Oh!

1317
01:29:10,053 --> 01:29:11,263
Oh, shit.

1318
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:14,474
My balls!
My fucking balls!

1319
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,202
My balls! Why did you
shoot me in the ball...

1320
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,499
Jesus.

1321
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:41,918
Sorry.

1322
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:46,548
Don't worry about us,
Mr. Claus. We got this.

1323
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:48,884
Who is that guy?

1324
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,344
He said
he was Mr. Claus.

1325
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:55,223
Fuck. Trudy.
No, no.

1326
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:56,766
She's in the house.
She's okay.

1327
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,226
She's safe.

1328
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,437
Oh, thank God.
Yeah.

1329
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,626
No, no.

1330
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,711
Go, go, go.
No. Wait.

1331
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,134
Oh, shit!

1332
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,347
Ho, ho!

1333
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,393
Fuck!

1334
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,147
Fucking die.

1335
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:02,658
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1336
01:33:02,952 --> 01:33:05,205
Yeah, over here.
Over here.

1337
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:07,415
Santa!

1338
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:09,667
Come on!

1339
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:11,461
Yeah.

1340
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:56,422
Fuck.

1341
01:34:20,363 --> 01:34:21,698
You're real?

1342
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:25,618
You're him.

1343
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,582
You're you.

1344
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,209
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

1345
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,462
The real goddamn
Santa Claus.

1346
01:34:37,297 --> 01:34:39,007
This is not
your night, pal.

1347
01:34:39,591 --> 01:34:41,551
Oh, I don't know.
I think you're wrong.

1348
01:34:42,343 --> 01:34:45,471
I think my whole shitty
life's built up to this moment.

1349
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:46,931
Because when I kill you,

1350
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:50,226
this whole goddamn holiday
finally ends.

1351
01:34:52,103 --> 01:34:53,438
Whatever it takes...

1352
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:57,650
...Christmas dies tonight.

1353
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:19,375
The last Christmas.

1354
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:31,304
Not if you
still believe.

1355
01:37:33,723 --> 01:37:35,391
No!

1356
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:07,382
I have no idea what
the fuck is going on here.

1357
01:38:10,176 --> 01:38:11,552
But this ends now.

1358
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:18,684
Damn right it does.

1359
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:29,862
Trudy,
be careful.

1360
01:38:33,699 --> 01:38:35,118
Santa!

1361
01:38:36,077 --> 01:38:37,995
Oh, no. Santa.

1362
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:40,790
Oh, no.

1363
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:49,966
You saved
my daughter.

1364
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,218
No.

1365
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:54,762
She saved me.

1366
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,640
Help him.
Please help him.

1367
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:00,059
Honey, I don't think
there's anything we can do.

1368
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,352
It's okay.

1369
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,563
It's too late for that.

1370
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:04,939
Too late.

1371
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:07,859
I'm cold.

1372
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,612
I haven't felt cold
in years.

1373
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,781
We need
to keep him warm.

1374
01:39:15,158 --> 01:39:16,909
All of the fires
are going out.

1375
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:18,661
We need to find
something to burn.

1376
01:39:20,621 --> 01:39:22,039
I got an idea.

1377
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:29,964
No.

1378
01:39:30,089 --> 01:39:32,216
No, no, no, no.
No, Jason, no.

1379
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,342
Please, Santa.

1380
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:35,887
I don't want
you to die.

1381
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:41,092
Jason, let's
slow this down.

1382
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,685
What are you doing?

1383
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:46,063
I've lived longer than
any man should ever live.

1384
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,691
He's pretty much dead.
What the hell is happening?

1385
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:50,919
- You don't need to burn money.
- Okay. More. Yeah.

1386
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:54,155
You can't die, Santa.
You have to get up.

1387
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,741
I think I used up
all my Christmas magic.

1388
01:39:58,075 --> 01:39:59,243
Sorry.

1389
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:05,082
I'm sorry I can't give
you what you asked for.

1390
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:08,503
Take that. Take that.

1391
01:40:09,045 --> 01:40:10,338
But you did.

1392
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:15,510
Santa, please don't die.

1393
01:40:15,635 --> 01:40:18,179
Wake up. Wake up.

1394
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,304
We need to
get him close to the fire.

1395
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,016
Jason.

1396
01:40:23,643 --> 01:40:25,311
Just wake up.

1397
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:27,772
Please.

1398
01:40:28,064 --> 01:40:29,482
No.

1399
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:36,948
Oh, I am
so, so sorry.

1400
01:40:42,328 --> 01:40:43,621
This man...

1401
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:49,460
This brave, brave man,
whoever he was...

1402
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:50,836
He's Santa.

1403
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,130
The real Santa.
He is.

1404
01:40:53,756 --> 01:40:55,591
And I still believe
in him.

1405
01:40:57,176 --> 01:40:59,554
I'll always believe
in you, Santa.

1406
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:06,185
I believe
in him, too.

1407
01:41:09,522 --> 01:41:10,856
He saved Trudy.

1408
01:41:12,275 --> 01:41:13,818
He saved our family.

1409
01:41:16,612 --> 01:41:18,155
What's realer
than that?

1410
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,287
Yeah, and maybe...

1411
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:28,708
I believe
in him, too.

1412
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,294
Uh, So do I.

1413
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:35,256
Oh. Shit.

1414
01:41:35,464 --> 01:41:37,091
I guess...

1415
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:39,552
I guess I do, too.

1416
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:41,554
Fuck me.

1417
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,306
I believe, too.

1418
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:55,568
Oh, my God.

1419
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:56,777
Santa!

1420
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:03,326
You...

1421
01:42:05,286 --> 01:42:06,412
You were dead.

1422
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:09,206
Christmas magic.

1423
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:12,835
I still don't really
understand...

1424
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:15,004
...how it works.

1425
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:22,803
Thank you.

1426
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,863
I don't know how we
can ever repay you.

1427
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:28,184
You brought me back from
the dead, so we'll call it even.

1428
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:31,020
Even?

1429
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,189
We just burned
half a million dollars.

1430
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:35,941
Look, Santa!
Hmm?

1431
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,234
Look who came.

1432
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:47,453
Now you show up, huh?

1433
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:49,664
You leave me
here to die,

1434
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:51,916
come back after all
the work's done, huh?

1435
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:54,627
You know what? I should
make you guys into a stew

1436
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:56,295
and feed you
to the elves!

1437
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:03,386
Yes, Blitzen! Yes,
I'm talking to you!

1438
01:43:03,678 --> 01:43:05,471
You, too, Prancer.

1439
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:12,520
You got my sack.

1440
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:16,565
My spare... You went home
and you got my spare sack?

1441
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,904
God, I can't stay mad
at you guys. I...

1442
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:27,159
Aw. I can't. I can't.

1443
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:32,873
Oh.

1444
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:35,209
Oh.

1445
01:43:45,094 --> 01:43:46,345
Hello, beautiful.

1446
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:47,930
Skullcrusher!

1447
01:44:01,318 --> 01:44:02,528
Guess this
is goodbye.

1448
01:44:02,945 --> 01:44:04,196
I gotta go.

1449
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:06,657
Do you have to?

1450
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:12,955
It's Christmas Eve,
and there's a lot of

1451
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,623
boys and girls
on the nice list

1452
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:16,375
that want their
presents, you know?

1453
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:20,504
Thank you.

1454
01:44:21,714 --> 01:44:23,048
For what?

1455
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:24,717
For believing in me.

1456
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,012
For reminding me that
Christmas still matters.

1457
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,390
And that I still...

1458
01:44:32,558 --> 01:44:33,768
...matter.

1459
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:38,147
You gave me
my "Ho, ho, ho" back.

1460
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:50,409
All right.
Get out of here.

1461
01:44:54,538 --> 01:44:57,249
Merry Christmas!

1462
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:01,128
Hyah!

1463
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:04,548
Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer!

1464
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:06,717
Now, Prancer and Vixen!

1465
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:10,054
On, Comet! On, Cupid!

1466
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:13,098
On, Donner and Blitzen!

1467
01:45:13,224 --> 01:45:16,852
Come on,
you beautiful bastards!

1468
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:20,064
We've got
some work to do!

1469
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,691
Hyah!

1470
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:25,778
Ho, ho, ho!

1471
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:28,989
Merry Christmas!

1472
01:46:57,494 --> 01:46:59,580
Hey, yo! What's Gucci,
squad fam?

1473
01:46:59,705 --> 01:47:02,666
It's the Bert Locker,
living the dream.

1474
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:05,169
You know what? See
this guy? Dead as hell.

1475
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:06,545
Santa's real,
all right?

1476
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,339
Don't end up on
the naughty list.

1477
01:47:08,464 --> 01:47:09,673
Do better.

1478
01:47:09,798 --> 01:47:11,133
Bert Lightstone out.
