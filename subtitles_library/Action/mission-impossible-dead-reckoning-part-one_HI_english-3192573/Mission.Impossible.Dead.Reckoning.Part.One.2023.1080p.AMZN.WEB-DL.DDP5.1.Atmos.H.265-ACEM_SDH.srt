that the Russians have focused

the majority of

Not exactly sure.

believe that it somehow has

Do you believe that, Kittridge?

301

What matters is that the rest
of the world believes it.

302
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:40,017
Japan, India, Germany,
and the Brits believe it,

303
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,888
and yet no one,
not even our closest allies,

304
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:46,824
have willingly whispered
one word of it to us.

305
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:49,525
Which would indicate that
there's a global race on

of this key.

00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,697
Every nation in it
for themselves,

308
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,700
not to kill this thing, Sir,

309
00:19:58,501 --> 00:19:59,904
but to weaponize it.

310
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,238
And in so doing,

311
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:06,076
establish a new, incontestable
form of global dominance.

312
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,912
How do we find this key first?

313
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:11,382
Well, we know that a buyer is passing
somewhere through the Middle East

314
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,184
sometime in the next 72 hours.

You believe.
[KITTRIDGE] At this point,

318

How would you verify that?

319

The only thing that can authenticate
one genuine half of the key

320
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:28,198
is the other genuine half
of the key.

Ethan Hunt tells me
you're a man I can trust.

Does he now?

2260

He also said

2261
02:33:15,632 --> 02:33:17,634
you would offer me a choice.

Interesting.

I choose to accept.
