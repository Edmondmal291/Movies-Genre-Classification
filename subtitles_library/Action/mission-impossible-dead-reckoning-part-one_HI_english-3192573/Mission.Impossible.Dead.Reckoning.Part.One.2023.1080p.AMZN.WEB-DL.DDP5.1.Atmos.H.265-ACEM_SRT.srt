<i>Mission Report.</i>

00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:49,508
<i>Russian Federation submarine
K599 Sevastopol</i>.

3
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:53,758
<i>Podkova. Day 74.</i>

4
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:58,661
<i>The active learning defense
system we are testing...</i>

5
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,437
<i>...continues to operate flawlessly.</i>

6
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:03,374
<i>One might even say...</i>

7
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,701
<i>miraculously.</i>

8
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:07,772
<i>We are navigating
under the Arctic ice cap</i>

9
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:10,908
<i>by dead reckoning
and five days from home.</i>

10
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,878
<i>After 25,000 nautical miles,</i>

11
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:16,914
<i>the</i> Sevastopol
<i>has deliberately approached</i>

12
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,716
<i>every navy in the world</i>

13
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,886
<i>and remained
completely undetected.</i>

14
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:28,926
<i>The</i> Podkova's <i>stealth capability
has exceeded all expectations.</i>

15
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:40,470
<i>We are at this moment
the state of the art of war.</i>

16
00:01:44,108 --> 00:01:46,509
<i>The most fearsome
killing machine</i>

17
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:48,746
<i>ever devised by man.</i>

18
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:54,450
<i>And we are impossible to find.</i>

19
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:00,523
Captain, we have a submerged contact,
designated Semyon-83,

20
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:03,326
exhibiting tonals of
a US Virginia-class submarine.

21
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:05,428
Bearing 130°, drawing forward.

22
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:09,066
Chief of the Watch,
man battle stations silently.

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,201
Wait for orders.

24
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,601
Officer of the Deck,
ship status?

25
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:13,904
Ship's depth, 50 meters.
Bottom, 72 meters.

26
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:16,307
Clearance to the ice canopy,
21 meters.

27
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,341
Distance to deep water?
Two kilometers.

28
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:20,044
Aleutian Precipice
in six minutes.

29
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:23,247
Ranging maneuver.
Helm, left 15 degrees rudder.

30
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,414
Steady course 100°.

31
00:02:24,547 --> 00:02:26,150
Come up easy on a standard bell.

32
00:02:26,283 --> 00:02:27,985
Captain has the conn.
Helm, aye!

33
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:29,686
Coming to course 100°.

34
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,635
Steady on course 100°.

35
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,238
Weapons Officer, range?

36
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,008
Firing solution is tracking
at a distance of 15,000 meters.

37
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:54,111
Sir, that doesn't make sense.
Tonals this loud and clear?

38
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:56,313
<i>He must be closer than that.</i>

39
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:00,416
Captain, firing solution
just did a step change

40
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,819
to 10,000 meters.

41
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:03,553
Nothing moves that fast.

42
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:04,989
All solutions are matching.

43
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:06,323
The range is true.

44
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:08,359
Helm, right full rudder
to course 270°.

45
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,393
Course 270°, aye.

46
00:03:13,831 --> 00:03:16,100
We'll just walk away
and head for deep water.

47
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,902
Contact bearing 160°.

48
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,436
Bearing rate zero?

49
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,406
He's there,
turning with us again.

50
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,642
He can see us.

51
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:27,878
Impossible. We're invisible.

52
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:31,048
Weapons, run diagnostics
on sonar and fire control.

53
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,316
<i>Something isn't right.</i>

54
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:33,984
Sir, he's flooding
his torpedo tubes!

55
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,020
Torpedo room, conn.

56
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:38,122
<i>Load all torpedo tubes.</i>
Aye, Sir.

57
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,394
Check clear!
Forward clear!

58
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:46,163
Aft clear! Ram torpedo!
Ramming!

59
00:03:47,563 --> 00:03:49,300
Torpedo tubes loaded.

60
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,935
He's opened outer doors!

61
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:52,836
Weapons, flood tubes one
through four and open outer doors.

62
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,805
Enter firing solution
into tube two.

63
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,640
Aye, Captain. Making tube
two ready in all respects.

64
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:59,009
Captain, he's provoking us.

65
00:03:59,143 --> 00:04:01,544
He wants an excuse
to blow us out of the water.

66
00:04:01,678 --> 00:04:03,781
Enemy torpedo in the water,
bearing 200°.

67
00:04:03,914 --> 00:04:05,215
1,000 meters and accelerating.

68
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,151
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead flank cavitate.

69
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:08,618
My rudder is left full.

70
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:10,154
Answering all ahead
flank cavitate.

71
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,622
Launch countermeasures.
Launching countermeasures.

72
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:16,860
Fire tube two.

73
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:18,095
Firing tube two.

74
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:23,133
Our torpedo is away.
Running hot.

75
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,638
Enemy torpedo still homing,
range 800 meters.

76
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:29,974
He's blown through
our countermeasures.

77
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:32,142
Helm, right full rudder.
Right full.

78
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:33,911
Aye, Sir!
600 meters.

79
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:35,913
Diving Officer, stand by to
emergency blow all main ballast tanks.

80
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:38,614
400 meters. Chief of the Watch,
stand by the collision alarm.

81
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:40,217
200 meters.
This is the captain.

82
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:43,153
All hands brace for impact.
Enemy torpedo impact in...

83
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:45,655
five... four...

84
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,726
three... two...

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,795
one. Impact!

86
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:03,807
What just happened?

87
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,142
It's, it's gone.

88
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,377
It missed us?

89
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,577
No.

90
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,781
It vanished
like it was never there.

91
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:13,417
Sonar,
where is the enemy vessel?

92
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:14,584
Bearing 330°,

93
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:16,253
4,000 meters
off our starboard bow.

94
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:17,955
Our torpedo is running true.

95
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,424
Impact with
enemy submarine in...

96
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:24,128
three... two... one.

97
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:29,665
Where was the impact?

98
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,469
Captain, enemy submarine
has vanished.

99
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,104
It's gone, Sir.

100
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:35,272
I don't understand.

101
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:42,813
He was never there.

102
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:47,117
We've been chasing a phantom.

103
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:50,120
It was right there.
The instruments don't lie.

104
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:52,222
They lied to us today.

105
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:55,292
Weapons,
shut down our torpedo. Aye, Captain.

106
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:56,927
Shutting down torpedo.

107
00:05:57,061 --> 00:05:59,229
Secure from battle stations.

108
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,634
This is why we have sea trials.

109
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:07,004
There's a bug in the system.

110
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:10,673
A ghost in the machine.

111
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:14,745
It's time to
go home. Captain!

112
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:16,579
Our own torpedo
is not responding.

113
00:06:16,713 --> 00:06:17,915
It's coming right at us!

114
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:20,583
Our torpedo's homing,
range 400 meters!

115
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:21,684
Oh, my God.
Wire command.

116
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,220
Shut down our weapon!

117
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:27,791
Our torpedo's still closing,
range 200 meters!

118
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:31,095
Blow all main ballast tanks!
Sound the collision alar..

119
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:32,055
Food delivery.

120
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,200
Hello?

121
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:52,776
Designator.

122
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,244
Easy.

123
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:56,880
Easy.

124
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,350
Designator.

125
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:05,088
India-Zulu-254.

126
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:08,025
Bravo-Echo-11.

127
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,994
No, not yet.

128
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:13,530
You need to ask me
the security question first.

129
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:15,465
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

130
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,434
Uh...

131
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:19,736
what is the oath?

132
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:26,910
We live and die
in the shadows...

133
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,980
for those we hold close...

134
00:08:31,515 --> 00:08:33,283
and for those we never meet.

135
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:38,789
You can put it on the table.

136
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:55,405
Hey.

137
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:00,510
Welcome to the IMF.

138
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:04,281
You made the right choice.

139
00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:09,086
Sir.

140
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:16,460
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.</i>

141
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:19,496
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

142
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,066
<i>Our lives are
the sum of our choices,</i>

143
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:26,370
<i>and we cannot escape the past.</i>

144
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:30,240
<i>Thirty years ago,
you were offered the choice.</i>

145
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:34,278
<i>Join the IMF
or spend your life in prison.</i>

146
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:37,581
<i>Because of
your unique natural talents,</i>

147
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:39,783
<i>your government forgave you.</i>

148
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,119
<i>But we will never forget.</i>

149
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,855
<i>Just as you will
never forget the death</i>

150
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:47,891
<i>that brought you to us
all those years ago.</i>

151
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,907
<i>This is to remind you</i>

152
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,443
<i>of your oath
and allegiance to us.</i>

153
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,147
<i>The stakes of this mission
are higher than ever.</i>

154
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,650
<i>Your habitual rogue behavior
will not be tolerated.</i>

155
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,285
<i>Should you choose to accept,</i>

156
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,422
<i>it is imperative
that you listen.</i>

157
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,892
<i>Your government is
searching for a key.</i>

158
00:10:22,025 --> 00:10:25,128
<i>Its purpose,
its vital importance to us</i>

159
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,698
<i>is none of your concern.</i>

160
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,366
<i>What should concern you</i>

161
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:33,003
<i>is the involvement
of your friend Ilsa Faust.</i>

162
00:10:34,137 --> 00:10:36,540
<i>She killed a courier
in Istanbul.</i>

163
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:38,909
<i>And we believe
he was carrying one half</i>

164
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,778
<i>of the key we're searching for.</i>

165
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:45,750
<i>Why she has chosen to interfere
in this affair is a mystery,</i>

166
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:48,051
<i>as are her whereabouts.</i>

167
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,320
<i>What is certain</i>

168
00:10:50,454 --> 00:10:53,323
<i>is that your government
has put a price on her head...</i>

169
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:58,061
<i>and these bounty hunters
are out to collect it.</i>

170
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:01,833
<i>They never bring
a fugitive back alive,</i>

171
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,334
<i>and rarely in one piece.</i>

172
00:11:04,468 --> 00:11:08,105
<i>We believe they're headed for
the Arabian Desert's Empty Quarter</i>

173
00:11:08,238 --> 00:11:09,573
<i>in search of your friend.</i>

174
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:14,277
<i>Find the bounty hunters,
and you may just find her.</i>

175
00:11:14,411 --> 00:11:17,414
<i>Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,</i>

176
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:20,984
<i>is to acquire the key
and deliver it to us.</i>

177
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:24,588
<i>What happens to Ilsa
after that is up to you.</i>

178
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:26,590
<i>As always,</i>

179
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:29,226
<i>if any members of your team
are caught or killed,</i>

180
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,864
<i>the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.</i>

181
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:37,701
<i>This message will self-destruct
in five seconds.</i>

182
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:40,237
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

183
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:15,238
Come.

184
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:06,122
Ethan.

185
00:13:35,218 --> 00:13:36,754
Hyah! Hyah!

186
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:04,641
Ohh!

187
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,054
So what are we dealing with?

188
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:53,690
This "entity" has
multiple personalities,

189
00:15:53,824 --> 00:15:56,192
at times behaving
like a computer virus,

190
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:58,328
then a tapeworm, then a botnet.

191
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,463
Distorting any and all
digital information

192
00:16:00,597 --> 00:16:02,133
with which it comes in contact.

193
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,769
Once infected,
nothing recorded, stored,

194
00:16:04,902 --> 00:16:07,705
or transmitted digitally
can be trusted as fact.

195
00:16:07,838 --> 00:16:11,474
At the outset, it concentrated
primarily on news and social media

196
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:13,077
which was of
little concern to us

197
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:14,712
as it often suited our purposes.

198
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:16,814
Until six months ago,
when the entity breached

199
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:19,249
Saudi Arabia's General
Intelligence Directorate.

200
00:16:19,382 --> 00:16:22,619
And assimilated their
top secret active-learning AI

201
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:24,889
before vanishing into the cloud.

202
00:16:25,022 --> 00:16:28,092
Subsequent attacks increased
ten-thousandfold overnight,

203
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,894
spreading exponentially.

204
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,963
Indicating that
the Entity has since become

205
00:16:33,764 --> 00:16:34,799
sentient.

206
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,634
You're telling me this thing
has a mind of its own?

207
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,569
<i>Over the last three weeks alone,</i>

208
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:42,305
<i>it has accessed our satellite
telecommunications,</i>

209
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:44,507
<i>the Federal Reserve,
the stock market,</i>

210
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,110
<i>and the national power grid.</i>

211
00:16:46,242 --> 00:16:47,410
<i>The FAA, NASA</i>

212
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:49,345
<i>and the combined branches
of our military.</i>

213
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,881
<i>And we're not alone.</i>

214
00:16:51,015 --> 00:16:53,951
<i>It has penetrated the World
and European Central Banks.</i>

215
00:16:54,085 --> 00:16:55,618
<i>Gained entry
to the major defense,</i>

216
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,454
<i>finance
and infrastructure systems</i>

217
00:16:57,587 --> 00:17:01,926
<i>of Russia, India, Israel,
Australasia, all of Europe.</i>

218
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:04,929
<i>And what did it do
to all these systems exactly?</i>

219
00:17:05,062 --> 00:17:06,329
Nothing.

220
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:09,332
Nothing?
It came and it went,

221
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,502
leaving fingerprints where
they could easily be found

222
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:15,605
and sending
a very clear message.

223
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:18,641
"I shall return."

224
00:17:18,776 --> 00:17:22,445
Whatever its ultimate goal is,
we're powerless to stop it.

225
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,049
The full force of its energy
is now directed

226
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,382
at a single objective.

227
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,318
The world's
intelligence networks.

228
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:30,653
The very truth as we know it.

229
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:33,891
<i>The entire intelligence
community is racing</i>

230
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:35,458
<i>to archive hard copies</i>

231
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:37,594
<i>of our fact-positive
knowledge bases</i>

232
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:39,629
<i>before our most secure
data centers</i>

233
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:41,598
<i>are breached and corrupted.</i>

234
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:43,533
<i>Which is only a matter of time.</i>

235
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:47,370
<i>The Entity will know precisely
how to undermine our every strength</i>

236
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:49,472
<i>and exploit our every weakness.</i>

237
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:52,243
How to turn our allies
into enemies

238
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,378
and our enemies into aggressors.

239
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:58,015
Why not air-gap
our intelligence servers?

240
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,683
Cut them off from
the outside world entirely?

241
00:18:00,818 --> 00:18:01,819
We already have.

242
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:05,089
But servers require humans
to maintain them.

243
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:08,291
And humans are the
weakest link in any security chain,

244
00:18:08,424 --> 00:18:12,595
especially when dealing with a Godless,
stateless, amoral enemy.

245
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,932
One that has been
patiently listening,

246
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:16,533
reading, watching.

247
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:20,204
Harvesting our deepest
personal secrets for years.

248
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:25,009
Able to beguile, blackmail,
bribe or be anyone it wants.

249
00:18:25,142 --> 00:18:28,746
And to manipulate us at will
through our total dependence

250
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:31,949
on a carefully constructed
digital reality.

251
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:34,051
An enemy that is everywhere...

252
00:18:35,351 --> 00:18:37,188
and nowhere...

253
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,923
and has no center.

254
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,962
All right,

255
00:18:45,095 --> 00:18:48,565
so what you're telling me is the
most awesome Goddamn intelligence

256
00:18:48,698 --> 00:18:51,101
and tactical apparatus
on the planet

257
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:54,004
has no way
of killing this thing.

258
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:56,807
You don't want to kill it, Sir.

259
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,676
You want to control it.

260
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,579
And how do we do that,
Mr. Kittridge?

261
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:06,382
The CIA's assets
in the Kremlin informed us

262
00:19:06,516 --> 00:19:07,918
that the Russians have focused

263
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:10,855
the majority of
their intelligence activity

264
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:14,691
on acquiring two halves
of a cruciform key.

265
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,526
And what does it unlock?

266
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:18,595
Not exactly sure.

267
00:19:18,729 --> 00:19:21,065
But the Russians seem to
believe that it somehow has

268
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:24,235
the power to deactivate
our mysterious Entity.

269
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:25,870
Though, ideally...

270
00:19:27,004 --> 00:19:29,807
they hope to control it,
harness it.

271
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,943
Do you believe that, Kittridge?

272
00:19:33,077 --> 00:19:37,014
What matters is that the rest
of the world believes it.

273
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:40,017
Japan, India, Germany,
and the Brits believe it,

274
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,888
and yet no one,
not even our closest allies,

275
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:46,824
have willingly whispered
one word of it to us.

276
00:19:46,957 --> 00:19:49,525
Which would indicate that
there's a global race on

277
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:52,363
to acquire the two halves
of this key.

278
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:54,697
Every nation in it
for themselves,

279
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:57,700
not to kill this thing, Sir,

280
00:19:58,501 --> 00:19:59,904
but to weaponize it.

281
00:20:00,037 --> 00:20:01,238
And in so doing,

282
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:06,076
establish a new, incontestable
form of global dominance.

283
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,912
How do we find this key first?

284
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:11,382
Well, we know that a buyer is passing
somewhere through the Middle East

285
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,184
sometime in the next 72 hours.

286
00:20:14,318 --> 00:20:17,553
We believe that he already has
one half of this key.

287
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:19,522
- You believe.
- At this point,

288
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:21,125
we can't be certain
it's not a counterfeit.

289
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:22,860
How would you verify that?

290
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:25,763
The only thing that can authenticate
one genuine half of the key

291
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:28,198
is the other genuine half
of the key.

292
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:29,499
Its true mate, if you will.

293
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:31,567
We think
it's some sort of fail-safe.

294
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,003
How do we find its mate?

295
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:36,439
Well, we believe the other
genuine half of the key

296
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:38,108
was in the hands of this woman.

297
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,110
Who is she?

298
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:41,511
<i>Ilsa Faust.</i>

299
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,180
<i>Former British Intelligence.</i>

300
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:44,148
Where is she now?

301
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:45,783
She's dead, Sir.

302
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,785
She was..
Excuse me..

303
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:51,454
<i>Killed by mercenaries
looking to collect a bounty.</i>

304
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:52,856
And who put up the bounty?

305
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,359
Given her body of work,
could have been anyone.

306
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:57,728
So anyone could have
her half of the key?

307
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:00,097
Hmm, not just anyone.

308
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,967
I sent a man to find her,

309
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,169
the only man
she would have entrusted

310
00:21:05,302 --> 00:21:06,236
with her half of the key.

311
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,938
Does he have it, Kittridge?

312
00:21:08,072 --> 00:21:09,639
Well, at present,
I don't know that, Sir.

313
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:12,176
He's refused to come in.

314
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,577
- Refused?
- Hmm.

315
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:16,280
Who the hell is this guy?

316
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:17,781
That's classified.

317
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:20,918
I'm the Goddamn Director
of National Intelligence.

318
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,153
What exactly is it
I'm not supposed to know about?

319
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:24,888
The IMF.
Mr. Kittridge.

320
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,291
The world bank. No,
that's the International Monetary Fund.

321
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,425
Mr. Kittridge.

322
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:30,794
No,
I mean the other IMF. Ours.

323
00:21:30,928 --> 00:21:32,730
What does it stand for?

324
00:21:33,496 --> 00:21:35,165
Impossible Mission Force.

325
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:37,301
You're not serious.

326
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,236
I'm afraid he is.

327
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,005
And what do they do exactly?

328
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:44,074
It's just as the name implies.
Whatever the rest of us can't.

329
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,509
And who is in charge?
They're not ones to take orders

330
00:21:46,642 --> 00:21:47,643
in the traditional sense.

331
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,545
We more or less...

332
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:52,750
leave word.

333
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:55,986
Leave... word.

334
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,488
Mr. Kittridge, Sir.

335
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,989
The IMF operates
outside the community

336
00:21:59,123 --> 00:22:01,191
and answers directly
to the president.

337
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:02,692
So let me get this straight.

338
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:05,796
When there's a mission
none of you can handle...

339
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:10,434
you just leave word
for a nameless man

340
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:13,536
and hope he gets the job done.

341
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:14,637
Is that it?

342
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:17,673
Should he choose to accept it.

343
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:19,076
What the hell kind of outfit

344
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:21,378
gets to choose
what orders to accept?

345
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:22,946
The IMF was expressly created

346
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,817
to ensure there would be
no unintended consequences.

347
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,953
If they cannot ensure
a mission's ultimate outcome,

348
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,056
they're authorized to decline.

349
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:25,275
I understand.

350
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,344
You're upset.

351
00:23:28,045 --> 00:23:29,880
I'm not upset, Kittridge.

352
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:32,950
You wanted me to listen.

353
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:37,154
This is me listening.

354
00:23:38,688 --> 00:23:40,023
All right.

355
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:41,859
I put the bounty on Ilsa's head.

356
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:44,328
I also told you how to find her!

357
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,696
I didn't ask her
to steal the key.

358
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,100
She did that for reasons
of her own. But...

359
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:53,636
that's the pattern, isn't it?

360
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:56,440
You get her out of trouble,

361
00:23:56,573 --> 00:24:00,010
and she always
found her way back in.

362
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,955
Wait! Ilsa!

363
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,690
Ilsa, wait! It's me!
What?

364
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:16,026
It's me.

365
00:24:22,766 --> 00:24:24,001
It's okay.

366
00:24:57,267 --> 00:25:00,437
Listen to me! You're dead!
You stay dead!

367
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,706
Ethan, wait!

368
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:09,413
I'm not going to apologize
to you, Hunt.

369
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,715
It's my job to use you.

370
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,418
Just like it's your job
to be of use.

371
00:25:14,551 --> 00:25:18,388
Did you accomplish your
mission or not?

372
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:25,495
Wherever
the other half of this is,

373
00:25:25,629 --> 00:25:28,799
whatever
the completed key unlocks,

374
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:30,400
I will find it.

375
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:33,270
And then what?

376
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:37,507
No one should be trusted
with control of the Entity.

377
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:39,743
I mean to kill it.

378
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:41,144
Ethan,

379
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,513
the next world war
isn't gonna be a cold one.

380
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:45,315
It's gonna be a shooting war,

381
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:48,385
it's gonna be a ballistic war over
a rapidly shrinking ecosystem.

382
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:51,555
It's gonna be a war for the
last of our dwindling energy,

383
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:54,057
drinkable water, breathable air.

384
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:58,395
Whoever controls the Entity
controls the truth.

385
00:25:59,763 --> 00:26:01,665
The concepts of right and wrong

386
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,336
can be clearly defined for
everyone for centuries to come.

387
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,005
Do you even hear yourself?

388
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:13,277
Your days of fighting
for the so-called greater good

389
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:15,846
are over.

390
00:26:16,446 --> 00:26:18,248
You need to pick a side.

391
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:21,551
I'm on the same side
I've always been on.

392
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,155
Stay out of my way.

393
00:26:25,822 --> 00:26:27,257
I can't do that.

394
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,093
We're gonna be coming after you.

395
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:32,329
The world's gonna be
coming after you.

396
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:36,300
And one way or another,
this mission of yours.

397
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:40,570
Is gonna cost you dearly.

398
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:51,783
If I don't get that,
we're gonna have company real soon.

399
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:10,600
Hello?

400
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:12,135
<i>Director Denlinger, please.</i>

401
00:27:13,003 --> 00:27:15,238
Uh, Director is unavailable
at the moment.

402
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,107
How can I help you?
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

403
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,609
CIA Director Eugene Kittridge.

404
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:20,812
<i>Designator?</i>

405
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:22,446
"Bassnote," lowercase,
all one word.

406
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,716
<i>Sir, we have a situation.</i>

407
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:25,916
No kidding.

408
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:28,085
<i>Your adjutant was
found unconscious</i>

409
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:29,754
<i>in his home ten minutes ago.</i>

410
00:27:29,886 --> 00:27:31,254
<i>It appears he was drugged.</i>

411
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,824
I understand.

412
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:34,091
<i>I don't think you do, Sir.</i>

413
00:27:34,224 --> 00:27:36,426
<i>Security has him
entering this facility</i>

414
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,162
<i>fifteen minutes ago.</i>
I understand, thank you.

415
00:27:39,296 --> 00:27:41,799
<i>Are you able to speak freely?</i>

416
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:43,066
No, thank you.

417
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,736
<i>A security team is on their way.</i>

418
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:46,738
<i>If you're in any danger,
simply hang up the phone</i>

419
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,004
<i>before I count to five.</i>

420
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:49,841
<i>One, two..</i>

421
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:56,980
So just how do you plan
on getting out of here?

422
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:03,520
Of course.

423
00:29:13,023 --> 00:29:14,491
<i>Listen up.</i>

424
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,194
<i>An American operative with
a grievance against his country</i>

425
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:19,596
<i>is missing
and has malfunctioned.</i>

426
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,800
His agenda represents a
threat to our national interests,

427
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:25,235
and he must be neutralized
at all cost.

428
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,204
Anything in
this man's possession

429
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:30,741
is of vital importance
and must be captured intact.

430
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:35,813
The man himself is expendable.
He is not to be underestimated.

431
00:29:35,947 --> 00:29:38,181
A master of infiltration,
deception,

432
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:40,350
sabotage and psych warfare.

433
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:43,086
For all intents and purposes,
ladies and gentlemen,

434
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,022
a mind-reading, shape-shifting
incarnation of chaos.

435
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:48,191
So, for your safety

436
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:50,694
and the safety
of those around you,

437
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,395
do not consider him secure

438
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:56,433
unless you have driven a wooden
stake through his open heart.

439
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:59,069
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

440
00:30:00,872 --> 00:30:03,975
A self-aware, self-learning,

441
00:30:04,107 --> 00:30:06,676
truth-eating digital parasite

442
00:30:07,812 --> 00:30:09,814
infesting all of cyberspace.

443
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:13,483
Well, it was bound
to happen sooner or later.

444
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:16,219
And the two halves
of this key just might provide

445
00:30:16,353 --> 00:30:19,456
the means of
controlling this Entity.

446
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:22,192
Meaning every government
on the planet would kill us

447
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:23,861
just to get that key.

448
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:24,929
Including our own.

449
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:26,129
Exactly.

450
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:28,164
Putting us
on an unsanctioned mission

451
00:30:28,298 --> 00:30:30,902
which has gone rogue
before it even started.

452
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:33,436
Meaning this very conversation

453
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,907
is technically
an act of treason.

454
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:39,476
Or as we like to call it,
Monday.

455
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:42,612
So what's the play?

456
00:30:42,747 --> 00:30:45,248
A buyer's coming in
on Flight 746 from Amsterdam

457
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:46,918
for a 30-minute layover

458
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,954
at which time he is hoping to
purchase that half of the key.

459
00:30:50,086 --> 00:30:51,822
And it stands to reason

460
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:54,591
the buyer will have the other half of
the key somewhere on their person.

461
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:57,795
Being the only way
to authenticate our half.

462
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,563
So how do we identify the buyer?

463
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:02,599
This Geiger counter will detect
a radiological signature

464
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:05,036
of the dragon's egg
embedded in the buyer's key.

465
00:31:05,168 --> 00:31:08,039
The augmented-reality overlay
in these glasses

466
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:09,740
will lead us to it.

467
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:12,642
Oh, that's very clever.

468
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:16,212
So, you ID the buyer,
pick his pockets,

469
00:31:16,346 --> 00:31:17,748
Bob's your uncle.
No.

470
00:31:17,882 --> 00:31:19,449
No. Of course not.

471
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,084
The complete key is of no value

472
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:22,385
if we don't know
what it unlocks.

473
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:25,056
So you're going
to sell the buyer

474
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:26,556
our half of the key.

475
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,960
While we figure out
the buyer's connecting flight

476
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:30,795
and book you a seat
on that plane.

477
00:31:30,928 --> 00:31:33,998
So you can follow the key
wherever it goes.

478
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,565
Which you hope is into the hands

479
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:37,167
of someone who knows
what it unlocks.

480
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,234
Precisely.

481
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:40,537
Finding the completed key

482
00:31:41,404 --> 00:31:42,572
is only the beginning.

483
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:45,342
The fate of the world
depends on finding

484
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:48,111
whatever it unlocks.

485
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:53,650
This guy, you know him?

486
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:56,319
Not personally.

487
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,421
But it is personal.

488
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:29,887
Thank you.

489
00:32:36,393 --> 00:32:37,728
Hey, what's that?
What?

490
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:41,297
Security alert. Suspicious bag
on its way to Venice.

491
00:32:41,431 --> 00:32:43,299
Nope, it's gone.
Must have been a false alarm.

492
00:32:51,876 --> 00:32:54,377
Overwatch, Snap Shot.
Where's he at?

493
00:32:58,115 --> 00:32:59,649
Snap Shot, Overwatch.
I have him.

494
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:02,519
Terminal B, Gate 15,
headed south.

495
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:06,556
I am so.
You are not.

496
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,460
Ethan, would you care to explain
to our friend the Net Ranger

497
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,763
<i>how I am just as capable
of writing code as he is?</i>

498
00:33:12,897 --> 00:33:13,764
No comment.

499
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:15,565
What, you figure
Phineas Phreak here

500
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,634
is gonna single-handedly
work out a way to kill the Entity

501
00:33:17,768 --> 00:33:19,870
<i>while I just hold
his soldering iron?</i>

502
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,806
Probably.
Definitely.

503
00:33:22,707 --> 00:33:24,842
Out of the way!

504
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,342
Tell me where he is.

505
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:28,112
<i>Where is he?</i>
Blue suit.

506
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:29,880
Right in front of you.

507
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:43,928
Oh!

508
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:54,138
Oh! Ah! Ow!

509
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,140
It's not him.

510
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:57,307
It's him.

511
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,341
<i>I'm telling you, it's not him.</i>

512
00:33:58,475 --> 00:33:59,542
And I'm telling you

513
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,712
facial comes back
with a perfect...

514
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:06,884
How did you do that?

515
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:10,020
No one is safe
from Phineas Phreak.

516
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:18,729
I got him.

517
00:34:18,863 --> 00:34:21,198
<i>Where is he?</i>
Terminal E, Gate 5.

518
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:24,201
Goddamn it, that's clear on
the other side of the airport.

519
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:29,405
<i>Ethan,
they're headed to Terminal E.</i>

520
00:34:29,539 --> 00:34:32,375
<i>That side of the airport
is all yours.</i>

521
00:34:33,077 --> 00:34:34,011
Thank you, Luther.

522
00:34:34,145 --> 00:34:35,345
I see the buyer.
<i>Got him.</i>

523
00:34:35,478 --> 00:34:38,348
The buyer is Otto Von Bork.
Swiss national.

524
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:39,750
<i>He's connecting to Venice,</i>

525
00:34:39,884 --> 00:34:42,720
<i>departing in 30 minutes
on Flight 1031.</i>

526
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:44,755
Benji, get me
on that flight to Venice.

527
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,725
Yep, Flight 1031 to Venice.
Stand by.

528
00:34:58,668 --> 00:34:59,636
What?

529
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,638
<i>Ethan, what just happened?</i>

530
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:03,306
He was bumped.
<i>Bumped?</i>

531
00:35:03,439 --> 00:35:04,574
What do you mean, bumped?

532
00:35:04,708 --> 00:35:06,811
<i>That woman picked his pocket.
Tag her.</i>

533
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:08,311
Tell me who she is.

534
00:35:17,021 --> 00:35:18,289
Luther, mute our comms.

535
00:35:18,421 --> 00:35:19,622
What is it?

536
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:21,225
That bag was on its way
to Flight 1031.

537
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:22,760
What bag?

538
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:25,129
There was a suspicious bag alert,
a few minutes ago.

539
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:26,297
So what about it?

540
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:27,832
It was on its way
to Flight 1031.

541
00:35:27,965 --> 00:35:30,201
To Venice.
It's the buyer's plane.

542
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,334
It's Ethan's plane.

543
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,703
Luther, do you copy? Who is she?

544
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:35,405
What if it wasn't a false alarm?

545
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:37,574
What if somebody's trying to
smuggle a bomb onto that plane?

546
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,676
And what if that's what
the Entity wants us to think

547
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,444
to keep Ethan off that plane?

548
00:35:41,578 --> 00:35:43,479
<i>Luther,
what's happening?</i> Should we warn him?

549
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:46,250
No. <i>Guys, guys? Do you hear me?</i>

550
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:47,318
Find that bag.

551
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,919
I'll direct you. Go.

552
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:51,387
<i>Luther, just tell me,
is there something wrong?</i>

553
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:54,892
Nothing to worry about.
It's under control.

554
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:55,793
Got her.

555
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:58,762
Info on the woman is coming now.

556
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,598
<i>Whoa.</i>

557
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:05,401
<i>Whoever she is, she's no spy.</i>

558
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,470
She's a thief.

559
00:36:07,604 --> 00:36:08,906
<i>Where am I going, Luther?</i>

560
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,342
Benji, there's a door
on your immediate left.

561
00:36:11,876 --> 00:36:13,676
<i>I'm unlocking it now.</i>

562
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:20,251
The bag you're after
is on tray 01833

563
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:23,386
<i>heading towards the northwest
corner of the facility.</i>

564
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,855
Copy that!

565
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:36,901
Hi.

566
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:40,470
Hello.

567
00:36:44,308 --> 00:36:45,575
Oh, I get it.

568
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:48,112
You thought I was someone else.

569
00:36:50,446 --> 00:36:51,749
I'm not interested.

570
00:36:53,183 --> 00:36:54,617
Give me a chance.

571
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:56,486
I'll scream.

572
00:36:58,155 --> 00:36:59,256
Please do.

573
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:03,894
What do you want?

574
00:37:05,062 --> 00:37:06,096
This key.

575
00:37:07,898 --> 00:37:10,267
The one you picked
from that man's pocket.

576
00:37:10,401 --> 00:37:11,902
It's worthless

577
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:13,070
without this key.

578
00:37:15,272 --> 00:37:16,707
But together

579
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,541
they're worth four million
in cryptocurrency

580
00:37:18,675 --> 00:37:20,677
that man was carrying
on a flash drive.

581
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:24,081
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

582
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:26,116
Then why was this drive
in your pocket?

583
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,353
Who are you?

584
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:30,687
You working with someone?

585
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:34,191
Never.
I'm strictly single-0.

586
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:35,359
Today you got a partner.

587
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:37,261
I need the man
you stole this from

588
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:38,528
to complete a transaction

589
00:37:38,661 --> 00:37:40,130
and leave this airport
with both of these

590
00:37:40,264 --> 00:37:41,799
without ever knowing
his pocket was picked

591
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:43,400
and before he boards
his flight in...

592
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:46,003
<i>Seven minutes.</i>
Seven minutes.

593
00:37:46,837 --> 00:37:49,039
We both know
you're a good pickpocket.

594
00:37:49,173 --> 00:37:51,541
Let's see what kind
of put-pocket you are.

595
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,645
You expect me to put it back.

596
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:57,948
Oh, I know you will.

597
00:37:58,082 --> 00:37:59,116
You're a thief.

598
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:01,752
You want the money.
And I can give it to you.

599
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:04,221
Your choice.

600
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:06,924
You're in or you're out.

601
00:38:09,226 --> 00:38:10,526
All right.

602
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,062
So what's the play?

603
00:38:12,196 --> 00:38:14,064
<i>I sure hope
you know what you're doing.</i>

604
00:38:14,564 --> 00:38:15,899
After you.

605
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:20,337
Oh, I won't be needing this.

606
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:22,139
I don't smoke.

607
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:26,043
Keep it.
Something to remember me by.

608
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:35,719
Ethan, the alloy in that key she
took off the buyer doesn't match.

609
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:36,787
It's counterfeit.

610
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,521
I expect nothing less.

611
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:40,090
<i>But that doesn't change
our objective.</i>

612
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:41,792
<i>The buyer has to leave
with both keys.</i>

613
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:43,693
<i>Talk to me, Luther!
Where am I going?</i>

614
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,695
Benji, head down the stairs
in front of you

615
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,297
and the bag should be
right there.

616
00:38:47,431 --> 00:38:49,066
Okay. I'm there. I'm there.

617
00:38:50,501 --> 00:38:51,802
Uh...

618
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:55,506
That's him.

619
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:57,107
<i>Right in front of you.</i>

620
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:01,912
Okay, okay. Hey, sorry.
Thought you were somebody else.

621
00:39:03,814 --> 00:39:05,816
Hunt's jerking our chain.

622
00:39:06,582 --> 00:39:09,086
Everybody!
Two-man teams, spread out.

623
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:12,122
Ethan, our American friends
are getting wise.

624
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:13,824
They're breaking up
and canvassing the airport.

625
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:15,426
<i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

626
00:39:15,591 --> 00:39:17,294
So, what do I call you?

627
00:39:17,428 --> 00:39:19,629
How about Grace?
And you?

628
00:39:19,763 --> 00:39:21,365
Well, listen, Grace.

629
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:23,467
You should know we're not
the only interested party.

630
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,369
If I tell you to run, you run.

631
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:26,904
Run?

632
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:28,505
This is getting exciting.

633
00:39:29,106 --> 00:39:30,606
Benji, have you got that bag?

634
00:39:30,741 --> 00:39:32,009
I found it!

635
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:48,459
There's a cylindrical device
inside.

636
00:39:48,624 --> 00:39:49,927
<i>I'm gonna take it out.</i>

637
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,299
<i>How we doing, Luther?</i>

638
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:57,868
Ethan, the buyer's in
the waiting area above you.

639
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:00,104
<i>Top of the escalator.</i>

640
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:03,373
<i>All units are headed
in your direction.</i>

641
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:05,542
<i>Your location is going to be
crawling with agents</i>

642
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:07,177
<i>any time now.</i>

643
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,355
Whatever it is,
I've just activated it.

644
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,727
Uh,
looks like we have five minutes.

645
00:40:25,062 --> 00:40:27,131
<i>Also, it appears to be nuclear.</i>
How big?

646
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:29,800
Big enough to matter to
everybody in this airport, I suspect.

647
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:31,802
Can you disarm it?
I haven't got any tools!

648
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:34,338
<i>Then find some.</i>
Where am I gonna find..

649
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:00,097
Is this where we run?

650
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:01,632
Not yet.

651
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:04,368
Benji, how are you doing
with that bomb?

652
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:05,736
Come on, come on.

653
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:08,071
I got it!

654
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:12,242
It's a cylinder cypher.
There's eight wheels.

655
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,677
Looks like 14 letters
on each wheel.

656
00:41:14,811 --> 00:41:17,381
1.5 billion
possible combinations.

657
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:19,016
Give or take.

658
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:21,285
Oh, my God.

659
00:41:21,418 --> 00:41:22,719
<i>What now?</i>

660
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:25,422
The wheels,
they spell out a message.

661
00:41:25,556 --> 00:41:26,957
U.R.DUNN.

662
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,725
No way. Not yet we aren't.

663
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,661
No, Luther, not D-O-N-E.

664
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:33,263
D-U-N-N.

665
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,299
It's my last name.

666
00:41:39,403 --> 00:41:40,703
It knows who I am.

667
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:55,352
Hold on. There's a message
on the display.

668
00:41:55,485 --> 00:41:57,187
<i>"I speak without a mouth."</i>

669
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:59,790
I fly through the air
without wings.

670
00:41:59,923 --> 00:42:01,391
What am I?"
You got me. What?

671
00:42:01,525 --> 00:42:04,027
It's a riddle. I suspect
this thing is voice-activated.

672
00:42:04,161 --> 00:42:05,429
It wants me to say the answer.

673
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:07,297
"I fly through the air..."

674
00:42:08,365 --> 00:42:09,399
An echo!

675
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:11,235
That's it! That's it!

676
00:42:11,368 --> 00:42:12,569
Okay, new message.

677
00:42:12,703 --> 00:42:15,105
"Are you afraid of death?"

678
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:17,541
What kind of a riddle is that?
<i>It's not a riddle.</i>

679
00:42:17,674 --> 00:42:19,543
It's a psychometric test.

680
00:42:19,676 --> 00:42:23,547
The more questions you answer,
the more it'll know about you.

681
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,849
"Are you afraid of death?"
No!

682
00:42:27,251 --> 00:42:29,786
<i>Did it work?</i>
I lied. It knows.

683
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,055
Just tell it the truth. Say it.

684
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:35,259
"Are you afraid of death?"
Yes! Who isn't?

685
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,262
<i>Pardon.</i>

686
00:42:44,768 --> 00:42:48,740
Okay, "What's always approaching
but never arrives?" Um...

687
00:42:48,872 --> 00:42:49,973
Wait, I know this one.

688
00:42:50,107 --> 00:42:51,508
The clock is ticking, Luther.

689
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:53,644
Riddles aren't my thing, Benji.
What more can I say?

690
00:42:53,777 --> 00:42:55,412
We're running out of time!

691
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,383
There he is.
Oh, this is too easy.

692
00:42:59,516 --> 00:43:01,118
<i>Sorry to bother you, Ethan.</i>

693
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:04,554
Would you happen to know
what's always approaching

694
00:43:04,688 --> 00:43:05,922
but never arrives?

695
00:43:06,056 --> 00:43:08,458
What is always approaching
but never arrives?

696
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:09,893
Tomorrow.

697
00:43:10,694 --> 00:43:11,928
What?

698
00:43:12,062 --> 00:43:13,930
Always approaching
BUT NEVER ARRIVES: Tomorrow.

699
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:15,999
It's tomorrow.
Tomorrow.

700
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,701
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

701
00:43:17,834 --> 00:43:19,469
Yes! Okay, next question.

702
00:43:19,603 --> 00:43:20,937
Give me the goods.

703
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:22,606
I'll be watching.

704
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,207
Why, you don't trust me?

705
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:31,315
Luther, what is happening?

706
00:43:31,448 --> 00:43:34,484
Nothing to worry about.
Everything is under control.

707
00:43:34,618 --> 00:43:35,886
Okay, next question:

708
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:39,156
"Who or what is the most
important thing to you?"

709
00:43:39,724 --> 00:43:40,824
Say it.
But if I..

710
00:43:40,957 --> 00:43:42,492
There's no other choice.
Say it.

711
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:44,428
My friends.

712
00:43:45,696 --> 00:43:46,596
Bastard.

713
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,143
Is he..
Yes, he is.

714
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:02,145
Give me the money,
give me the key.

715
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:05,882
Okay. "What gets bigger
the more you take away?"

716
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:08,518
A hole.
A hole. Brilliant!

717
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:21,865
I've got no more questions
and there's one more wheel.

718
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:24,267
How am I supposed to give
answers if I've got no questions?

719
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:25,869
That must be your final test.

720
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:27,971
I've got 45 seconds!

721
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:32,342
What happens now?

722
00:44:32,476 --> 00:44:34,411
I'm thinking. Don't move.

723
00:44:34,544 --> 00:44:35,946
Luther, I'm pinned down.
Need a way out.

724
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,114
<i>Where am I going?</i>

725
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,615
We have a bigger problem, Ethan.

726
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,951
It's very possible
no one is getting out of here.

727
00:44:41,084 --> 00:44:43,453
What? There's a bomb
in baggage handling.

728
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:44,588
A nuclear bomb.

729
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:45,956
<i>The question I asked you</i>

730
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:47,491
<i>is part of the code
for disarming it.</i>

731
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:48,925
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

732
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:51,695
Why didn't you tell me this?

733
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:53,930
You had a lot going on.
We didn't want to bother you.

734
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:58,001
Listen to me. A nuclear bomb is
something you bother me with immediately.

735
00:44:58,135 --> 00:44:59,936
How much time?
Twenty seconds.

736
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,505
Twenty seconds?

737
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:02,740
There's one more riddle.

738
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:03,875
I'm working on it.
Fifteen seconds!

739
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:05,710
Easy, easy. What's the riddle?

740
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:08,011
In the time it takes me
to explain, we'll all be dead!

741
00:45:08,145 --> 00:45:09,781
Come on, Benji.
Why do we always end up

742
00:45:09,913 --> 00:45:10,914
in these situations?

743
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:12,582
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

744
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:14,050
<i>Nine... eight...</i>

745
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:17,554
seven... six... five...

746
00:45:19,623 --> 00:45:21,258
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

747
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:29,834
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

748
00:45:29,966 --> 00:45:31,101
What is it?

749
00:45:32,602 --> 00:45:33,537
It's empty.

750
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,938
What do you mean, empty?

751
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:36,473
<i>There's nothing inside.</i>

752
00:45:41,846 --> 00:45:42,780
She took the key.

753
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:43,714
Which key?

754
00:45:43,848 --> 00:45:44,849
Our key. The real key.

755
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:46,183
What?
<i>Luther, find her.</i>

756
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:58,195
I got her.
She's headed for Terminal E.

757
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:11,541
No, it can't be.

758
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:12,375
What is it?

759
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:14,411
Luther, Benji. Abort. Get out!

760
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:16,546
Where do we rendezvous?
We don't!

761
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,649
This mission is terminated.
Get out now.

762
00:46:31,061 --> 00:46:32,930
Hunt! Stop right there!

763
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:35,733
Hey!
You see him? Where is he?

764
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,634
Excuse me! Excuse me!

765
00:46:37,768 --> 00:46:40,170
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

766
00:47:10,634 --> 00:47:11,668
Move!

767
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,744
Move!
Move, move!

768
00:48:01,685 --> 00:48:03,854
He's got to be here somewhere.

769
00:48:05,022 --> 00:48:06,857
Goddamn.

770
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,703
What we have here
is shortwave radio,

771
00:48:19,837 --> 00:48:24,240
magnetic audio recording,
cathode ray tube monitors.

772
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:26,744
No more ones and zeros.

773
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,180
It's a fully analog,
offline safe room,

774
00:48:30,313 --> 00:48:32,883
shielded from
our digitally-based Entity.

775
00:48:34,517 --> 00:48:36,386
Where is this feed coming from?

776
00:48:36,519 --> 00:48:39,489
CORONA spy satellite
from the Cold War.

777
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:42,258
Had no idea we were still
using those things.

778
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:43,894
Yeah, well, we weren't.

779
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:46,296
Gave them to the National
Weather Service 20 years ago.

780
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:48,431
This is the last one
still functioning.

781
00:48:48,565 --> 00:48:52,737
So, will this thing help us
find your nameless IMF man?

782
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,571
Nothing can do that, Sir.

783
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:58,475
But it has allowed us
to keep tabs on this woman.

784
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:03,446
She was seen with our man
at the airport in Abu Dhabi.

785
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,515
Who is she?

786
00:49:06,483 --> 00:49:08,184
Where is she now?

787
00:49:19,295 --> 00:49:20,563
You are here

788
00:49:20,697 --> 00:49:23,233
because Italian police
received an anonymous tip

789
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:25,036
that a woman matching
your description

790
00:49:25,168 --> 00:49:28,505
would be arriving on the
afternoon flight from Abu Dhabi.

791
00:49:28,638 --> 00:49:32,509
This woman had multiple
passports in her possession.

792
00:49:32,642 --> 00:49:36,646
This one is wanted for fraud
in Saint Petersburg.

793
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:40,583
Jewel theft in Antwerp.
Art theft in Monaco.

794
00:49:40,718 --> 00:49:44,055
Graft in Milan.
Extortion in Mumbai.

795
00:49:44,187 --> 00:49:46,724
But this is my favorite:

796
00:49:46,857 --> 00:49:48,959
Resisting arrest in Rio.

797
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:52,863
Which leads me to wonder...

798
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:55,933
which one of these women is you?

799
00:49:56,767 --> 00:49:59,003
I've never seen these before
in my life.

800
00:49:59,136 --> 00:50:00,403
They were in your purse.

801
00:50:00,537 --> 00:50:03,406
And your picture
is in every one.

802
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,910
May I see?
Please.

803
00:50:11,448 --> 00:50:13,084
Yes, it's an amazing likeness,

804
00:50:13,216 --> 00:50:14,952
but it isn't me.

805
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:17,788
As I keep telling you, I'm...

806
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:20,356
I'm a schoolteacher
from Brighton.

807
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,059
I'm on a sabbatical.

808
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:24,061
Whatever you're involved in,

809
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:27,865
you've obviously made
some very powerful enemies.

810
00:50:36,774 --> 00:50:37,842
<i>Sì.</i>

811
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:39,642
Okay.

812
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,414
Her lawyer is here.

813
00:50:45,082 --> 00:50:46,349
My lawyer?

814
00:51:21,584 --> 00:51:23,419
Magistrate Spezzi.

815
00:51:23,553 --> 00:51:25,688
I'm sorry, who are you?

816
00:51:26,123 --> 00:51:27,124
Interpol.

817
00:51:28,324 --> 00:51:32,863
I've come regarding the arrest
of the woman from Abu Dhabi.

818
00:51:32,997 --> 00:51:34,330
I'll need to inventory

819
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:36,399
the items on her person
at the time of her arrest.

820
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:39,435
May I see some
identification, please?

821
00:51:40,403 --> 00:51:41,638
Where's the rest?

822
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:43,974
I assure you,
this is everything.

823
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:45,308
What was your name?

824
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:47,610
She left Abu Dhabi
with a certain key.

825
00:51:48,112 --> 00:51:49,280
There was no key.

826
00:51:49,412 --> 00:51:51,514
It was an unusual sort.

827
00:51:52,382 --> 00:51:54,584
One that you could
mistake for a pendant.

828
00:51:55,552 --> 00:51:59,089
The kind that you'd be tempted
to hang on a chain

829
00:51:59,223 --> 00:52:00,891
around Amelia's neck.

830
00:52:02,492 --> 00:52:03,727
Amelia?

831
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:05,729
Your wife.

832
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:09,465
Mother of
your lovely daughter Serena.

833
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,835
You're not Interpol.

834
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:13,369
I am if I wish to be.

835
00:52:14,571 --> 00:52:17,708
I can be anything,
and I know everything.

836
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:19,442
I know this wouldn't be
the first time

837
00:52:19,576 --> 00:52:21,578
you've helped yourself
to stolen goods.

838
00:52:21,712 --> 00:52:22,947
A Cartier bracelet.

839
00:52:23,646 --> 00:52:25,481
You were cleared of suspicion,

840
00:52:25,615 --> 00:52:27,584
but we both know you gave it
to your mistress Valeria

841
00:52:27,718 --> 00:52:31,722
on August 21st,
her 29th birthday.

842
00:52:31,856 --> 00:52:33,858
Who are you?

843
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:37,895
I'm gonna have to search you,

844
00:52:38,028 --> 00:52:38,929
just to be sure.

845
00:52:43,533 --> 00:52:46,402
Your secretary's
no longer with us.

846
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,918
Thank you officers.

847
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,641
Please.

848
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:07,959
You can wait outside. Thank you.

849
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:25,976
You.

850
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,477
You did this.

851
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,913
I called the police.

852
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:31,715
I didn't tell them
about your colorful past.

853
00:53:33,616 --> 00:53:35,019
That's on you.

854
00:53:35,152 --> 00:53:37,721
You put-pocketed that key
on another passenger

855
00:53:37,855 --> 00:53:39,489
before you were arrested.

856
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:42,393
<i>You exchanged details
and arranged to meet later on.</i>

857
00:53:42,525 --> 00:53:43,827
<i>Right now,</i>

858
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:45,262
<i>someone out there
hasn't the slightest clue</i>

859
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:46,964
<i>they're holding on
to that key for you.</i>

860
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:49,266
<i>An unwitting courier.</i>

861
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,633
<i>The perfect accomplice.</i>

862
00:53:51,634 --> 00:53:54,570
<i>I'm guessing a man, middle-aged?</i>

863
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:56,840
A man waiting his whole life

864
00:53:56,974 --> 00:53:59,743
to be noticed
by a woman like you.

865
00:54:01,078 --> 00:54:02,445
An orphan.

866
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:06,717
Highly intelligent.
Inherently resourceful.

867
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,687
Growing up in poverty left
you longing for the finer things.

868
00:54:11,355 --> 00:54:12,923
Other people's things.

869
00:54:13,623 --> 00:54:14,691
Someone saw your potential

870
00:54:14,825 --> 00:54:17,728
and helped you hone your skills.

871
00:54:17,861 --> 00:54:20,164
Skills that gave you the life
you thought you wanted.

872
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:23,734
Tailored clothes,
fine dining, luxury hotels.

873
00:54:23,867 --> 00:54:27,071
Skills that kept you
one step ahead of the law...

874
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:29,472
until now.

875
00:54:31,175 --> 00:54:32,076
You can't blame a girl

876
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:34,078
for trying to make
a dishonest living.

877
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:37,881
You had no idea
what you were stealing.

878
00:54:38,015 --> 00:54:39,917
Otherwise, you never
would have stolen it.

879
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:42,453
Tell you what.

880
00:54:42,585 --> 00:54:43,787
You get me out of here,

881
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:46,156
and I'll take you
straight to the key.

882
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,590
I have a better idea.

883
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:49,126
You're gonna tell me everything.

884
00:54:49,259 --> 00:54:51,428
Then I'll think about
getting you out of here.

885
00:54:51,561 --> 00:54:53,596
Now start with who hired you.

886
00:54:53,731 --> 00:54:56,666
And don't lie to me
because I'll know.

887
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,335
I have no idea who hired me.

888
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:01,071
Contact with the client
was almost entirely electronic.

889
00:55:01,205 --> 00:55:02,139
Email?
Texts.

890
00:55:02,272 --> 00:55:03,407
Encrypted?
Naturally.

891
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:05,075
Almost?
Pardon?

892
00:55:05,209 --> 00:55:07,878
You said contact with the client
was almost entirely electronic.

893
00:55:08,012 --> 00:55:10,513
There was a dead drop
in a café in Luxembourg.

894
00:55:10,646 --> 00:55:12,383
An envelope.
What was in the envelope?

895
00:55:12,515 --> 00:55:14,550
A ticket to Abu Dhabi.

896
00:55:15,452 --> 00:55:16,754
And...

897
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:20,024
a picture of you.

898
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:23,761
My instructions were
to follow you at the airport.

899
00:55:23,894 --> 00:55:25,262
You'd be tailing a mark.

900
00:55:25,396 --> 00:55:26,497
Said mark would have a key

901
00:55:26,629 --> 00:55:28,265
and four million
in cryptocurrency.

902
00:55:28,399 --> 00:55:30,934
That drive was useless,
by the way. It was empty.

903
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:33,103
The only hope
I have of getting paid

904
00:55:33,237 --> 00:55:34,670
is to deliver
your half of the key.

905
00:55:34,805 --> 00:55:37,307
And you were instructed
to deliver it to?

906
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:38,641
Venice.

907
00:55:38,776 --> 00:55:40,944
Party at Ducale Palace.
Tomorrow. Midnight.

908
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,681
You expecting someone?

909
00:55:45,816 --> 00:55:47,751
Your friends from the airport.

910
00:55:47,885 --> 00:55:49,619
Saw them in the hallway
a few minutes ago.

911
00:55:52,022 --> 00:55:54,024
You could have
said something sooner.

912
00:55:54,158 --> 00:55:56,460
Well, they were chasing you,
not me.

913
00:56:19,316 --> 00:56:21,051
A <i>pervertito!</i>

914
00:56:22,886 --> 00:56:24,321
No, Grace, Grace.

915
00:56:26,523 --> 00:56:27,458
No, no, no.

916
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:29,927
She's my client.

917
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:31,795
<i>Grazie.</i>

918
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:33,363
Grace.

919
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:40,137
No, no. No.

920
00:56:41,105 --> 00:56:43,774
<i>Tranquillo. Tranquillo.</i>

921
00:57:12,369 --> 00:57:14,571
No, no! Move! Move!

922
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,042
Sorry!

923
00:57:30,354 --> 00:57:31,822
Come on.

924
00:57:35,726 --> 00:57:37,194
Who parks like that?

925
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:57,881
Grace! You got to pull over.

926
00:57:58,715 --> 00:57:59,850
Grace.
Pull over. Listen.

927
00:57:59,983 --> 00:58:02,886
I'm trying to help you!
Grace!

928
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:03,754
Aah!

929
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:11,128
Bring her to me.

930
00:58:40,257 --> 00:58:40,991
Uhh.

931
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:43,293
Are you okay? You okay?

932
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:44,228
No, no, no.

933
00:58:44,361 --> 00:58:45,262
We're okay.

934
00:58:50,968 --> 00:58:52,169
Give me your hand.

935
00:58:52,302 --> 00:58:55,038
Slow, slow, slow. It's okay.

936
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:56,840
Slow.

937
00:58:56,974 --> 00:58:59,443
Is anything broken?
Are you okay? You okay?

938
00:58:59,576 --> 00:59:00,877
Hunt!

939
00:59:01,511 --> 00:59:02,779
It's over!

940
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:04,915
Let the girl go.

941
00:59:05,048 --> 00:59:06,516
Put the bracelets on.

942
00:59:07,784 --> 00:59:10,954
There you go.
Put them on. Do it!

943
00:59:11,088 --> 00:59:13,357
It's okay,
he's not gonna shoot you.

944
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:18,195
Put your weapons down now.

945
00:59:19,419 --> 00:59:22,159
Special Operations.
He's wanted for terrorism.

946
00:59:22,466 --> 00:59:25,669
Goddamn it, Degas,
get rid of those women.

947
00:59:25,802 --> 00:59:28,005
Hunt, listen to me.
Listen to me.

948
00:59:28,138 --> 00:59:29,940
Let her go and put them on.

949
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:33,043
Put your weapons down NOW.

950
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:33,886
It's all under control.

951
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:34,845
It's okay!

952
00:59:34,978 --> 00:59:37,047
It's okay! It's okay!

953
00:59:40,017 --> 00:59:42,853
Everybody down! Get down!

954
00:59:47,157 --> 00:59:49,826
Down, down!
Cover, cover! Cover!

955
01:00:20,324 --> 01:00:22,526
You're driving.
What?

956
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:24,061
No, no, no!

957
01:00:25,262 --> 01:00:26,563
Go, go, go.
Hit the accelerator.

958
01:00:26,697 --> 01:00:28,165
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

959
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:33,470
Aah!

960
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,743
Go, go, go, go, go!

961
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:43,280
Oh!

962
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:57,127
Get in!

963
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,929
You're good.
Just keep it going.

964
01:00:59,062 --> 01:01:00,864
Don't stop, don't stop.

965
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,608
Car, car, car.

966
01:01:20,016 --> 01:01:23,320
It's okay. Just put your foot
on the brake. Start the car.

967
01:01:23,453 --> 01:01:24,822
Wait, wait, wait!

968
01:01:24,955 --> 01:01:27,124
Wh-What's happening?
I'm done. I'm not doing this.

969
01:01:27,257 --> 01:01:28,860
People are chasing us.

970
01:01:28,992 --> 01:01:30,828
Yes, they are. You're driving.

971
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:32,062
Now come on.

972
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:05,061
Who is that person?

973
01:02:05,195 --> 01:02:06,930
I have no idea.

974
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:13,703
You okay? I will
be when this is over.

975
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:18,008
Oh, man.

976
01:02:22,012 --> 01:02:23,613
It's okay. It's okay.

977
01:02:24,614 --> 01:02:25,716
Whoa!

978
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:37,327
Is there anyone not chasing us?

979
01:02:37,461 --> 01:02:39,596
We got to get rid of this car.

980
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:43,967
Scooters! Damn it.

981
01:03:05,622 --> 01:03:06,690
What are we doing?

982
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,560
Finding us a new car.

983
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,267
Whoa! Jesus!

984
01:03:32,415 --> 01:03:33,718
Okay.

985
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,535
Just give me a second.

986
01:03:51,668 --> 01:03:52,602
Yeah, mm-hm.

987
01:03:52,737 --> 01:03:54,037
Thanks. Okay?
Yeah.

988
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,740
You ready?
I'm ready.

989
01:03:59,576 --> 01:04:00,510
Wow.

990
01:04:00,644 --> 01:04:01,846
You okay?
Mm-hm.

991
01:04:01,979 --> 01:04:04,247
Yeah, look, I'm sorry.
This is...

992
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:06,449
It's okay. No, this car,
the way they...

993
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,151
It's okay. No,
the way they set them up,

994
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:09,219
sometimes it's just...

995
01:04:09,352 --> 01:04:10,755
Let's go.
It takes me...

996
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,122
Let's go.

997
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:23,734
Traffic cameras have picked
up the woman on facial recognition.

998
01:04:23,858 --> 01:04:25,768
She is now in a yellow Fiat 500.

999
01:04:26,492 --> 01:04:27,792
Units are in pursuit.

1000
01:04:42,252 --> 01:04:44,822
Now I got you.

1001
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,131
Looks like we lost them.

1002
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:21,826
Let's just..

1003
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,193
Move, move, move!

1004
01:05:40,343 --> 01:05:42,178
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby!

1005
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:55,926
Wait, what?

1006
01:05:56,894 --> 01:05:57,928
No, no, no.

1007
01:06:03,968 --> 01:06:05,235
Go, go, go!

1008
01:06:08,405 --> 01:06:10,306
Whoa, that's..
Go straight.

1009
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:18,481
Just take your foot
off the accelerator.

1010
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:19,817
We're on fire!
No, no, no.

1011
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,919
It's the tires.
Just try to go straight.

1012
01:06:23,988 --> 01:06:25,388
Hang on.
Why is it spinning?

1013
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:28,959
Good, good, good!

1014
01:06:31,062 --> 01:06:32,963
I've got it,
I've got it, I've got it.

1015
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,265
Turn right. Down there.

1016
01:06:35,398 --> 01:06:36,867
Right there!
Come on!

1017
01:06:45,442 --> 01:06:46,877
Got to go right. Turn right!

1018
01:06:49,479 --> 01:06:51,548
Who's driving?
You're driving.

1019
01:06:51,681 --> 01:06:53,683
Go, go, go. Just go straight.

1020
01:06:54,484 --> 01:06:57,755
Go, go, go.
Just keep going straight.

1021
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:01,658
Or left. Go, go, go.
You're doing good.

1022
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,966
Cops! A lot of cops!

1023
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:11,701
Take the wheel.

1024
01:07:11,836 --> 01:07:12,803
Brake, brake, brake.

1025
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:20,343
Okay, your wheel.

1026
01:07:22,378 --> 01:07:24,247
Straight?
Right, right, right.

1027
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,615
Got it!

1028
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:35,893
Which way now?
Left, left, left.

1029
01:07:43,666 --> 01:07:46,003
Okay.
You're good, you're good.

1030
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:52,275
That's a person.

1031
01:07:54,577 --> 01:07:56,312
Okay, car, car.
I see it!

1032
01:08:23,174 --> 01:08:24,574
Hit it.

1033
01:08:31,782 --> 01:08:32,950
Hang on!

1034
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:34,617
Go, go, go, go.

1035
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:35,853
Aah!

1036
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:46,130
What is happening?
Where are we going?

1037
01:08:46,263 --> 01:08:47,497
I don't know.

1038
01:08:48,364 --> 01:08:50,333
Okay, brake, brake, brake!

1039
01:09:19,696 --> 01:09:20,998
Don't hate me.

1040
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,970
Grace? Grace!

1041
01:09:41,352 --> 01:09:42,452
Come on, come on.

1042
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:12,283
Ethan!

1043
01:10:12,415 --> 01:10:13,650
Ethan!

1044
01:10:17,388 --> 01:10:19,555
Well, come on.

1045
01:11:14,178 --> 01:11:16,679
All right. We know
Grace has one half of the key.

1046
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,416
We also know she's gonna be
at the Ducale at midnight.

1047
01:11:19,549 --> 01:11:20,818
And now we have
a pretty good idea

1048
01:11:20,951 --> 01:11:23,020
as to who will be waiting
for her there.

1049
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:24,922
The event is being hosted
by none other than

1050
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:27,992
our favorite international arms
trafficker and black marketeer,

1051
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,193
Alana Mitsopolis.

1052
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,928
The White Widow.

1053
01:11:31,061 --> 01:11:33,197
Does she know
who you actually are,

1054
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:37,034
or does she still think you're the
globally notorious mass murderer John Lark?

1055
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,068
Who says I'm not?

1056
01:11:38,936 --> 01:11:41,372
Didn't she put a price
on your head in Paris?

1057
01:11:41,504 --> 01:11:42,705
She did indeed.

1058
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,143
She and Ethan,
they worked it out.

1059
01:11:46,276 --> 01:11:47,745
You never did tell me how.

1060
01:11:47,878 --> 01:11:49,747
Can we continue, please?

1061
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,181
Right.

1062
01:11:51,315 --> 01:11:53,117
So, assuming we get the
complete key at the party tonight,

1063
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,885
we still don't know
what it unlocks.

1064
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,552
So we need to find
somebody who does.

1065
01:11:56,686 --> 01:11:59,123
The question is
where to start looking.

1066
01:11:59,256 --> 01:12:01,325
We figured that the bomb
didn't just walk

1067
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:02,525
into the airport by itself.

1068
01:12:02,658 --> 01:12:03,693
Right? Somebody put it there.

1069
01:12:03,827 --> 01:12:06,397
Somebody working for the Entity.

1070
01:12:06,529 --> 01:12:07,663
This is everything I captured

1071
01:12:07,798 --> 01:12:09,900
from the security cameras
at the airport

1072
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:12,202
up to the minute
everything went haywire.

1073
01:12:12,336 --> 01:12:15,605
And this is the feed
from your AR sunglasses.

1074
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:17,274
I've been running
facial recognition

1075
01:12:17,408 --> 01:12:18,709
on everyone in the airport.

1076
01:12:18,842 --> 01:12:20,277
See anything strange?

1077
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:24,748
It's like a ghost.

1078
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:26,850
Ghosts don't have reflections.

1079
01:12:30,187 --> 01:12:34,124
The only person
in the airport with no identity.

1080
01:12:34,258 --> 01:12:38,628
The only man who can't be found
anyplace else in the airport

1081
01:12:38,762 --> 01:12:41,131
except that reflection.

1082
01:12:42,266 --> 01:12:43,967
He's being erased.

1083
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:45,869
In real time.

1084
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,244
The Entity.

1085
01:12:55,345 --> 01:12:56,847
It's protecting him.

1086
01:12:57,381 --> 01:12:59,316
You saw him, didn't you?

1087
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:03,187
I wasn't sure.

1088
01:13:04,521 --> 01:13:05,989
Well, who is he?

1089
01:13:13,297 --> 01:13:14,865
Someone I thought...

1090
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,035
...died a long time ago.

1091
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:19,635
In another life.

1092
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,972
Before the IMF.

1093
01:13:22,773 --> 01:13:25,675
Before I was offered the choice.

1094
01:13:28,745 --> 01:13:30,747
And in a very real sense...

1095
01:13:31,515 --> 01:13:33,616
...he made me who I am today.

1096
01:13:35,352 --> 01:13:36,920
Does he have a name?

1097
01:13:37,054 --> 01:13:39,857
He calls himself Gabriel.

1098
01:13:42,625 --> 01:13:44,194
You know him.

1099
01:13:46,363 --> 01:13:48,098
There is no knowing him.

1100
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,568
He has no recorded past.

1101
01:13:51,701 --> 01:13:53,636
The Entity made sure of that.

1102
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:55,939
He's a dark messiah.

1103
01:13:56,073 --> 01:13:59,143
The Entity's chosen messenger.

1104
01:13:59,276 --> 01:14:00,611
And he sees death...

1105
01:14:01,644 --> 01:14:05,883
...as a gift he wants to share
with the rest of the world.

1106
01:14:06,016 --> 01:14:07,117
How do you know this?

1107
01:14:07,251 --> 01:14:10,254
I still have
a few friends left in MI6.

1108
01:14:11,054 --> 01:14:12,456
Friends who are afraid

1109
01:14:12,589 --> 01:14:15,726
of the British government
gaining control of the Entity.

1110
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:17,794
Any attempt to try to stop them

1111
01:14:17,928 --> 01:14:19,763
would be seen
as an act of treason.

1112
01:14:19,897 --> 01:14:22,966
And because you're disavowed,
your friends...

1113
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:25,035
called and asked you for help.

1114
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:27,838
They knew
Gabriel serves the Entity.

1115
01:14:27,971 --> 01:14:29,907
They knew he was
on his way to Istanbul

1116
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,011
to acquire one half
of a cruciform key.

1117
01:14:35,145 --> 01:14:36,446
So...

1118
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:37,981
...I beat him to it.

1119
01:14:39,149 --> 01:14:41,385
And when Kittridge
put a bounty on your head...

1120
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,154
you went to the desert to hide.

1121
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:47,224
But somehow the bounty hunters
found you anyway.

1122
01:14:47,357 --> 01:14:48,358
Yes.

1123
01:14:48,492 --> 01:14:50,928
So, did these friends
of yours happen to say

1124
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:52,629
what the key unlocks?

1125
01:14:52,796 --> 01:14:56,800
MI6 suspects it leads somehow
to the Entity's source code.

1126
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:58,835
Source code.

1127
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,138
When were you
gonna tell me this?

1128
01:15:02,105 --> 01:15:03,706
I'm telling you now.

1129
01:15:05,075 --> 01:15:07,311
Your friends at MI6,
how'd they contact you?

1130
01:15:07,444 --> 01:15:09,479
Did you speak with them?
Face to face?

1131
01:15:09,613 --> 01:15:10,881
I'm disavowed.

1132
01:15:11,014 --> 01:15:12,683
They couldn't risk
meeting me in person,

1133
01:15:12,816 --> 01:15:15,052
so all communication..

1134
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:20,123
Was electronic. Was digital.

1135
01:15:23,594 --> 01:15:25,729
No. We can't be sure
that was the Entity.

1136
01:15:25,862 --> 01:15:27,698
We can't be sure it wasn't.

1137
01:15:27,831 --> 01:15:29,166
We can't be sure
anything is real

1138
01:15:29,299 --> 01:15:31,368
outside of
this very conversation.

1139
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:33,904
None of you should be here.

1140
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:35,072
Ethan..
No.

1141
01:15:35,205 --> 01:15:36,540
You don't know Gabriel.
I do.

1142
01:15:36,673 --> 01:15:38,508
It's not the killing he enjoys.

1143
01:15:38,642 --> 01:15:40,310
It's the suffering it causes.

1144
01:15:40,444 --> 01:15:42,579
And he knows
the best way to get to me...

1145
01:15:42,714 --> 01:15:44,881
...is through all of you.

1146
01:15:46,049 --> 01:15:47,751
And if Gabriel knows me...

1147
01:15:47,884 --> 01:15:49,286
The Entity knows.

1148
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:51,421
There's a reason
he wants me here.

1149
01:15:51,555 --> 01:15:52,923
There's...

1150
01:15:53,056 --> 01:15:54,825
There's a reason
he wants you here.

1151
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,226
It wants you here.

1152
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:00,230
"Who or what is the most
important thing to you?"

1153
01:16:01,064 --> 01:16:03,000
No. You have to go.
You all have to go.

1154
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:04,701
Ethan, what if
it wants us to leave?

1155
01:16:04,835 --> 01:16:06,103
Like you made us
leave the airport.

1156
01:16:06,236 --> 01:16:08,505
What if it wants you alone
at that party tonight?

1157
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:10,874
Then I go alone. At least I don't
have all of you to worry about.

1158
01:16:11,008 --> 01:16:13,110
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you.

1159
01:16:13,243 --> 01:16:15,579
Ethan, you're playing
four-dimensional chess

1160
01:16:15,713 --> 01:16:16,813
with an algorithm.

1161
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:18,282
The Entity knows who we are.

1162
01:16:18,415 --> 01:16:21,118
Any move we make,
it's probably considered it.

1163
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:22,686
Anything we do,
we have to assume

1164
01:16:22,819 --> 01:16:24,121
that it's counting on us
to do it.

1165
01:16:24,254 --> 01:16:25,757
If you want to beat this thing,

1166
01:16:25,889 --> 01:16:28,158
you have to start
thinking like it.

1167
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:31,561
Cold, logical, unemotional.

1168
01:16:31,695 --> 01:16:35,165
If that key really does
grant control of the Entity,

1169
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,736
Gabriel is the last person
on Earth who should have it.

1170
01:16:38,869 --> 01:16:40,170
She's right, Ethan.

1171
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:43,340
Gabriel cannot have that key.

1172
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:47,544
And none of our lives can
matter more than this mission.

1173
01:16:54,051 --> 01:16:55,585
I don't accept that.

1174
01:17:22,145 --> 01:17:24,081
It's my first time in Venice.

1175
01:17:28,151 --> 01:17:29,586
It's mine, too.

1176
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:33,116
Buy you a drink?

1177
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,318
I'm waiting for someone.

1178
01:18:35,452 --> 01:18:36,353
So am I.

1179
01:18:38,455 --> 01:18:41,425
We can wait together.
I'm Gabriel.

1180
01:18:41,558 --> 01:18:42,959
If you say so.

1181
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,362
And you're Grace.

1182
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:56,006
I don't have it on me.

1183
01:18:56,139 --> 01:18:57,674
I wouldn't expect you to.

1184
01:18:58,542 --> 01:19:00,510
In any case,
I'm not here for the key.

1185
01:19:01,611 --> 01:19:02,446
What do you want?

1186
01:19:02,579 --> 01:19:03,881
Suppose, while we're waiting,

1187
01:19:04,014 --> 01:19:05,415
I tell you a little story.

1188
01:19:05,549 --> 01:19:07,684
You're obviously not
the person I came here to meet.

1189
01:19:07,819 --> 01:19:09,486
It's your story, Grace.

1190
01:19:10,922 --> 01:19:12,489
I know how it ends.

1191
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:16,526
Let me buy you a drink,
and perhaps we can change it.

1192
01:19:44,287 --> 01:19:45,923
Let's go to a party.

1193
01:19:53,898 --> 01:19:55,398
Excuse me, Sir.

1194
01:19:57,133 --> 01:19:58,668
Would you please follow me?

1195
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:02,072
It's important
you understand that

1196
01:20:02,205 --> 01:20:04,274
you're not unique.

1197
01:20:04,976 --> 01:20:06,243
Thirty years ago,

1198
01:20:06,978 --> 01:20:08,345
her name was Marie.

1199
01:20:08,478 --> 01:20:11,849
The first of many women
who trusted our mutual friend.

1200
01:20:11,983 --> 01:20:14,484
Women who all have
something he wants.

1201
01:20:15,285 --> 01:20:17,755
Women who are all in
over their heads,

1202
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:19,256
or so he tells them.

1203
01:20:19,857 --> 01:20:21,091
Sound familiar?

1204
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:23,260
What happened to Marie?

1205
01:20:23,393 --> 01:20:25,763
Same thing that happens
to all the women he uses...

1206
01:20:26,898 --> 01:20:29,566
...as well as anyone else
who touches that key.

1207
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:32,068
He doesn't care
whether people live or die.

1208
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:35,405
He cares only
about his objective.

1209
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:38,709
And right now, the only thing
standing in his way...

1210
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,577
...is you.

1211
01:20:41,511 --> 01:20:43,781
Why should I believe you?
You shouldn't.

1212
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:46,383
You've stepped into
a world of lies, Grace.

1213
01:20:46,516 --> 01:20:47,852
Nothing anyone says is true.

1214
01:20:47,985 --> 01:20:51,989
Just remember that when
he promises to protect you.

1215
01:20:52,122 --> 01:20:53,390
Grace.

1216
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,339
It's been a long time, Ethan.

1217
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,710
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

1218
01:21:13,945 --> 01:21:15,846
Good evening, everyone.

1219
01:21:16,546 --> 01:21:19,082
If it isn't John Lark.

1220
01:21:20,051 --> 01:21:21,953
Except it isn't, actually.

1221
01:21:22,853 --> 01:21:25,056
But until you're ready
to tell me your real name,

1222
01:21:25,188 --> 01:21:27,691
Lark will have to do.

1223
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:30,527
It's good to see you, Alana.

1224
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:36,433
And you're Gabriel, I presume.

1225
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,870
I've heard
so very little about you.

1226
01:21:40,004 --> 01:21:43,640
Aren't you so much more
handsome in person?

1227
01:21:46,142 --> 01:21:48,411
Such a gentleman, too.

1228
01:21:53,416 --> 01:21:55,151
And you must be Grace.

1229
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,423
Should I know you?

1230
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:03,226
I believe
you have something for me.

1231
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,161
You hired me.

1232
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,664
Oh, I handpicked you.

1233
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,175
Don't!

1234
01:22:20,778 --> 01:22:21,779
You don't.

1235
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:44,234
She doesn't have it.

1236
01:22:45,136 --> 01:22:46,569
Where is it?

1237
01:22:46,703 --> 01:22:49,506
It's in the last place
you would ever think to look.

1238
01:22:52,043 --> 01:22:54,611
Why don't we go upstairs
and have a drink?

1239
01:22:58,716 --> 01:22:59,784
Where are you going?

1240
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:02,269
This is a private party.
You can't come in.

1241
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,322
Whoa!

1242
01:23:13,731 --> 01:23:14,732
Damn.

1243
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:17,567
As most of you know,
I am merely a broker.

1244
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,870
I connect a buyer and a seller.

1245
01:23:20,004 --> 01:23:22,238
Sometimes for money,
sometimes for information,

1246
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:25,475
but mostly for friendship.

1247
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,979
I just want
everyone to get along.

1248
01:23:30,147 --> 01:23:32,482
With me, especially.

1249
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:35,820
But the world is changing.

1250
01:23:35,953 --> 01:23:37,722
Truth is vanishing.

1251
01:23:37,855 --> 01:23:39,556
War is coming.

1252
01:23:39,689 --> 01:23:43,526
And the key to world domination is,
of all things,

1253
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:44,694
a key.

1254
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:48,465
One with the power
to control the Entity.

1255
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:50,801
One that any government
in the world

1256
01:23:50,935 --> 01:23:53,703
would pay a king's ransom
to take possession of.

1257
01:23:54,504 --> 01:23:56,239
And some of my dearest friends,

1258
01:23:56,372 --> 01:23:58,441
in this case
every major nuclear power

1259
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,044
and a handful of minor ones,

1260
01:24:00,177 --> 01:24:01,712
have asked me
to deliver this key.

1261
01:24:01,846 --> 01:24:04,380
Of course,
if you do find the key,

1262
01:24:04,514 --> 01:24:06,951
you'll be forced to confront
an impossible dilemma.

1263
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:10,087
Whoever you give the key to
will be forever in your debt.

1264
01:24:10,221 --> 01:24:13,891
But to the rest of the world,
you'll be an enemy.

1265
01:24:14,024 --> 01:24:15,492
Oh, I like her.

1266
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,528
What's your relationship
with him?

1267
01:24:18,661 --> 01:24:21,331
Gabriel represents
another interested party.

1268
01:24:21,464 --> 01:24:24,300
In fact, this party

1269
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:28,172
was arranged
by that interested party.

1270
01:24:28,304 --> 01:24:30,373
You could even say
that this party

1271
01:24:30,507 --> 01:24:32,375
is that interested party.

1272
01:25:06,243 --> 01:25:07,477
Is this...

1273
01:25:08,179 --> 01:25:09,780
The Entity.

1274
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,818
And so the plot thickens.

1275
01:25:14,684 --> 01:25:16,754
Do I give the key
to one of my old friends,

1276
01:25:16,887 --> 01:25:20,423
or do I hand it and my fate
over to Gabriel

1277
01:25:20,557 --> 01:25:23,393
and his infernal machine?

1278
01:25:25,029 --> 01:25:28,598
What makes you so sure
you'll get the completed key?

1279
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:31,235
You have one half of it.

1280
01:25:31,367 --> 01:25:33,103
And she knows

1281
01:25:34,038 --> 01:25:35,705
where the other half is.

1282
01:25:38,309 --> 01:25:40,343
Assuming you can get it,

1283
01:25:41,477 --> 01:25:44,949
why don't you just keep the key
and all that power for yourself?

1284
01:25:45,082 --> 01:25:47,483
Because she doesn't know
what it unlocks...

1285
01:25:48,118 --> 01:25:49,720
any more than the rest of us.

1286
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:52,857
So, like it or not,
you have to choose a suitor.

1287
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:57,228
Distastefully put, Lark,
but it's true.

1288
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,097
Of course,
I know what it unlocks.

1289
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:03,600
And what's he offering
for the key?

1290
01:26:03,734 --> 01:26:05,401
As I've explained
to Grace before,

1291
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:07,004
I'm not here for any key,

1292
01:26:07,137 --> 01:26:09,639
as I'll have both halves
in hand tomorrow.

1293
01:26:09,773 --> 01:26:11,909
What makes you
so certain of that?

1294
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:14,812
You've no idea
of the power I represent.

1295
01:26:14,945 --> 01:26:18,581
Thousands of quadrillions
of computations per millisecond

1296
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:21,886
subtly manipulating
the minds of billions

1297
01:26:22,019 --> 01:26:24,955
while parsing every
possible cause and effect,

1298
01:26:25,089 --> 01:26:27,825
every scenario,
however implausible,

1299
01:26:27,958 --> 01:26:32,428
into a very real map
of a most probable next.

1300
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:35,032
And with only a few changes
to the present,

1301
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:38,568
the future is all but assured.

1302
01:26:39,535 --> 01:26:41,437
The key will come to me...

1303
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,274
tomorrow...

1304
01:26:44,108 --> 01:26:47,111
on the Orient Express
bound for Innsbruck.

1305
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:48,578
Innsbruck?

1306
01:26:48,712 --> 01:26:50,047
It knows.

1307
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:53,017
It knows that you've already
chosen your suitor.

1308
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:56,519
It knows that you intend to
mate the two halves of the key

1309
01:26:56,653 --> 01:26:58,688
in a desperate grasp
for control.

1310
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:02,226
I, however, have been promised
the completed key

1311
01:27:02,359 --> 01:27:04,094
will lay itself at my feet,

1312
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:08,065
provided someone dies tonight.

1313
01:27:09,333 --> 01:27:10,633
Who?

1314
01:27:11,201 --> 01:27:12,435
Her.

1315
01:27:14,138 --> 01:27:15,172
Or her.

1316
01:27:17,674 --> 01:27:19,609
And you will bear witness,
Ethan.

1317
01:27:19,743 --> 01:27:23,680
The key will be mine,
and I will be gone.

1318
01:27:23,814 --> 01:27:26,383
Like smoke in a hurricane.

1319
01:27:26,516 --> 01:27:29,619
But only after someone
you care about dies.

1320
01:27:31,487 --> 01:27:32,990
It is written.

1321
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:35,692
You see what this is...

1322
01:27:37,127 --> 01:27:38,095
...don't you?

1323
01:27:39,529 --> 01:27:40,998
He's afraid.

1324
01:27:42,032 --> 01:27:43,200
It's afraid.

1325
01:27:44,368 --> 01:27:46,136
Somehow it knows we're close.

1326
01:27:47,438 --> 01:27:48,839
Why else would you be here?

1327
01:27:48,973 --> 01:27:50,140
Help me.

1328
01:27:50,274 --> 01:27:53,444
Help me complete the key,
and I will kill this thing.

1329
01:27:53,576 --> 01:27:55,079
It knows
your every secret, Alana.

1330
01:27:55,212 --> 01:27:57,214
Don't listen to
this, this fanatic.

1331
01:27:57,348 --> 01:27:58,614
Help him and you'll die, too.

1332
01:27:58,749 --> 01:28:00,751
Help him, everyone dies.

1333
01:28:00,884 --> 01:28:02,552
I'll see you tomorrow.

1334
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:06,156
Alana?

1335
01:28:13,297 --> 01:28:14,832
His fate is written.

1336
01:28:15,598 --> 01:28:17,101
Shall we write yours, too?

1337
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:19,837
Alana.

1338
01:28:22,638 --> 01:28:25,175
I'm sorry... Lark.

1339
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,018
Oof!

1340
01:28:36,253 --> 01:28:39,156
For old times' sake,
I'll let you choose which one.

1341
01:28:40,324 --> 01:28:41,992
Ilsa...

1342
01:28:42,126 --> 01:28:43,227
or Grace.

1343
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,362
Kill him, Zola. Kill him.

1344
01:28:45,496 --> 01:28:46,562
Kill him where he stands!

1345
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,365
The choice is yours then, Alana.

1346
01:28:48,499 --> 01:28:49,665
Though I'll remind you,

1347
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,802
Grace knows
where half the key is.

1348
01:28:52,936 --> 01:28:56,306
If anything happens
to either of them,

1349
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:57,775
there is no place on Earth

1350
01:28:57,908 --> 01:29:00,277
where you or your God
will be safe from me.

1351
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:02,379
There's no place
that I won't go to kill you.

1352
01:29:02,513 --> 01:29:04,048
That is written.

1353
01:29:04,181 --> 01:29:06,250
It's good to see you,
old friend.

1354
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:13,824
See you soon.

1355
01:29:39,016 --> 01:29:42,086
You have made
a terrible mistake.

1356
01:29:42,219 --> 01:29:44,421
My life is on the line here.

1357
01:29:44,555 --> 01:29:47,191
I have to be
on that train tomorrow.

1358
01:29:48,492 --> 01:29:50,727
And I have to have that key.

1359
01:29:51,962 --> 01:29:55,065
And I do not care how I get it.

1360
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:00,337
Don't move.

1361
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:07,643
Run as far as you can.

1362
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:49,086
What the f..

1363
01:31:52,849 --> 01:31:54,318
Grace! Grace!

1364
01:31:55,285 --> 01:31:56,320
Grace!

1365
01:32:11,335 --> 01:32:13,503
<i>Luther, Benji, if you hear me,
I need eyes.</i>

1366
01:32:13,637 --> 01:32:16,206
<i>Grace is leaving the Ducale
on foot. She has the key.</i>

1367
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:17,074
We're here. Go.

1368
01:32:17,207 --> 01:32:18,909
<i>Need to find her. Where is she?</i>

1369
01:32:19,042 --> 01:32:21,211
Damn it! I've lost picture,
I need another satellite.

1370
01:32:21,345 --> 01:32:23,413
Hacking the Russian Zenith 4
spy satellite.

1371
01:32:23,547 --> 01:32:26,049
We're scraping the barrel,
but it'll have to do.

1372
01:32:34,558 --> 01:32:35,792
This way!

1373
01:32:54,878 --> 01:32:57,180
Where am I going?
Come on, come on.

1374
01:32:57,314 --> 01:32:59,249
<i>Stand by.</i>
Just hurry.

1375
01:32:59,383 --> 01:33:01,051
She's just north of you,
crossing the bridge.

1376
01:33:01,184 --> 01:33:02,552
<i>Say again, Benji. Say again.</i>

1377
01:33:02,686 --> 01:33:04,321
Just head north, Ethan.
She's crossing the bridge.

1378
01:33:22,072 --> 01:33:23,874
<i>Ethan, take the passage
to your right.</i>

1379
01:33:24,007 --> 01:33:25,208
Yeah, I see it!

1380
01:33:25,342 --> 01:33:27,044
<i>Down that narrow alley
and turn left.</i>

1381
01:33:27,177 --> 01:33:29,212
I'm losing picture again.
Looking for another.

1382
01:33:29,346 --> 01:33:31,716
The Entity is
knocking out satellites

1383
01:33:31,848 --> 01:33:33,450
faster than I can hack
into them.

1384
01:33:58,608 --> 01:34:00,277
<i>Benji, I don't see her.
Where is she?</i>

1385
01:34:00,410 --> 01:34:02,112
<i>Down
the narrow alley and turn left.</i>

1386
01:34:02,245 --> 01:34:03,748
Okay, copy that.

1387
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,115
<i>Turn right.</i>

1388
01:34:05,248 --> 01:34:07,752
<i>Sorry, my mistake.
I meant left. Another left.</i>

1389
01:34:07,884 --> 01:34:09,186
Oh, my God.

1390
01:34:09,319 --> 01:34:10,822
Ethan, our comms
have been breached!

1391
01:34:10,954 --> 01:34:12,189
You're talking to the Entity!

1392
01:34:12,322 --> 01:34:14,558
<i>Turn left. Turn right.</i>

1393
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:15,760
<i>Take the bridge to your left.</i>

1394
01:34:15,892 --> 01:34:17,829
Ethan, that is not me!
Do you copy?

1395
01:34:17,961 --> 01:34:18,830
Ethan, come in.

1396
01:34:18,962 --> 01:34:20,530
<i>Down the alley to your left.</i>

1397
01:34:20,664 --> 01:34:21,665
<i>Turn left.</i>

1398
01:34:21,799 --> 01:34:23,367
<i>Turn right.</i>

1399
01:34:24,901 --> 01:34:26,236
Try to reestablish comms.

1400
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:27,904
Wait, where are you
going? To try and find Ethan.

1401
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,107
<i>Go to the end of the alley
and turn right.</i>

1402
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,777
<i>Ethan, I see Grace about
800 meters in front of you.</i>

1403
01:34:32,909 --> 01:34:34,177
<i>Take that passage.</i>

1404
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,489
<i>Wait! Not that way!</i>
What, why?

1405
01:34:45,989 --> 01:34:47,557
Which way?

1406
01:34:47,691 --> 01:34:48,925
Left or right?

1407
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:50,494
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1408
01:34:50,627 --> 01:34:53,130
W-What do you mean,
it doesn't matter? Where is she?

1409
01:34:53,263 --> 01:34:55,932
<i>She's on her way
to the Minich Bridge...</i>

1410
01:34:57,334 --> 01:34:59,169
<i>...where Gabriel is waiting.</i>

1411
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,139
<i>You will never get there
in time.</i>

1412
01:35:03,206 --> 01:35:05,275
<i>But you can, Ilsa.</i>

1413
01:35:06,376 --> 01:35:09,513
<i>I know what matters most
to you, Ethan.</i>

1414
01:35:09,646 --> 01:35:10,882
This isn't Benji.

1415
01:35:11,014 --> 01:35:12,482
<i>No, it's not.</i>

1416
01:35:13,216 --> 01:35:14,951
<i>But you are done.</i>

1417
01:35:38,642 --> 01:35:39,676
So be it.

1418
01:37:28,019 --> 01:37:29,720
Hah!

1419
01:38:16,132 --> 01:38:18,234
I was hoping it'd be you.

1420
01:38:38,588 --> 01:38:39,790
Aah!

1421
01:38:40,925 --> 01:38:42,325
Aah!

1422
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:28,839
Guh. Okay.

1423
01:41:48,245 --> 01:41:49,646
I'm sorry.

1424
01:41:50,781 --> 01:41:53,616
I've forgotten your name.
Luther.

1425
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:56,553
Benji.

1426
01:41:58,255 --> 01:41:59,489
And her?

1427
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:01,725
Ilsa.

1428
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:04,594
Were you close?

1429
01:42:05,461 --> 01:42:06,931
You and she?

1430
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:08,999
In our way.

1431
01:42:11,534 --> 01:42:13,838
I'm the reason she's dead.
No.

1432
01:42:13,971 --> 01:42:16,372
She's the reason you're alive.

1433
01:42:16,506 --> 01:42:18,309
And that's the truth.

1434
01:42:18,441 --> 01:42:20,543
I don't know
how to feel about it.

1435
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:22,545
You probably never will.

1436
01:42:24,181 --> 01:42:25,582
I'm so sorry.

1437
01:42:27,051 --> 01:42:29,619
If there's anything
I can do to help...

1438
01:42:29,753 --> 01:42:31,822
That's what we'd like
to talk to you about.

1439
01:42:33,623 --> 01:42:36,260
In a little over three hours,

1440
01:42:36,392 --> 01:42:37,795
the White Widow
is expected to be

1441
01:42:37,928 --> 01:42:40,865
on the Orient Express
to Innsbruck,

1442
01:42:40,998 --> 01:42:42,867
where a buyer is waiting
to take receipt

1443
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,935
of the complete
and verified key.

1444
01:42:45,069 --> 01:42:47,338
But she doesn't have
the complete key.

1445
01:42:47,470 --> 01:42:48,973
That Widow doesn't.

1446
01:42:51,108 --> 01:42:52,343
But ours could.

1447
01:42:52,475 --> 01:42:54,778
What... is that?

1448
01:42:55,645 --> 01:42:57,513
Your chance to be someone else.

1449
01:42:57,647 --> 01:42:58,782
I don't understand.

1450
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:00,516
We're not gonna
lie to you, Grace.

1451
01:43:00,650 --> 01:43:01,719
You're in a lot of trouble.

1452
01:43:01,852 --> 01:43:02,887
No number of fake passports

1453
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,520
is gonna get you
out of this one.

1454
01:43:04,654 --> 01:43:06,190
Governments know who you are.

1455
01:43:06,323 --> 01:43:07,590
The White Widow knows.

1456
01:43:07,725 --> 01:43:08,993
And the Entity knows.

1457
01:43:09,126 --> 01:43:12,695
Your future boils down
to three options now.

1458
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:13,764
Prison.

1459
01:43:13,898 --> 01:43:15,065
Death.

1460
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,432
Or the choice.

1461
01:43:16,566 --> 01:43:18,335
The choice?

1462
01:43:18,468 --> 01:43:19,770
At one time or another,

1463
01:43:19,904 --> 01:43:22,873
each of us was in
a similar situation to yours.

1464
01:43:23,007 --> 01:43:25,575
And each of us
was offered the choice.

1465
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:27,778
The same choice
we're offering you now.

1466
01:43:27,912 --> 01:43:29,179
Which is?

1467
01:43:30,247 --> 01:43:31,715
To come with us.

1468
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:34,151
And be a ghost.

1469
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:12,282
Wait, wait. Stop, stop.

1470
01:45:13,384 --> 01:45:14,718
You're not serious.

1471
01:45:14,852 --> 01:45:17,354
Well, you did say
you'd do anything to help.

1472
01:45:17,488 --> 01:45:19,555
And you jump off the train

1473
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:21,425
with the key?

1474
01:45:21,557 --> 01:45:22,359
Yes.

1475
01:45:22,493 --> 01:45:23,693
You.

1476
01:45:24,228 --> 01:45:26,296
Not us.
Yes.

1477
01:45:26,897 --> 01:45:28,298
And what happens to me?

1478
01:45:28,432 --> 01:45:31,402
You'll be taken into custody
by Clandestine Services,

1479
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:32,702
most likely the same men

1480
01:45:32,836 --> 01:45:35,139
that have been chasing me
since Abu Dhabi.

1481
01:45:35,272 --> 01:45:37,908
Shortly thereafter,
a man will come to see you.

1482
01:45:38,042 --> 01:45:39,877
His name is Eugene Kittridge.

1483
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:43,313
You'll tell him I sent you.
That I gave you the choice.

1484
01:45:43,947 --> 01:45:46,150
And that you choose to accept.

1485
01:45:47,818 --> 01:45:50,821
And you trust
this Kittridge person?

1486
01:45:51,621 --> 01:45:53,757
I trust him
to recognize your value.

1487
01:45:55,059 --> 01:45:56,692
He'll want to use you.

1488
01:45:57,494 --> 01:45:59,997
And after that, it's what?

1489
01:46:00,596 --> 01:46:01,899
This?

1490
01:46:02,766 --> 01:46:04,201
When do I get my life back?

1491
01:46:04,334 --> 01:46:06,003
What life?

1492
01:46:06,636 --> 01:46:08,638
I mean it, Grace.
What life?

1493
01:46:08,772 --> 01:46:11,842
I lived that life.
We all did.

1494
01:46:11,975 --> 01:46:15,179
Nobody's making us
do this, Grace.

1495
01:46:15,312 --> 01:46:17,214
We're here
because we want to be.

1496
01:46:18,148 --> 01:46:19,983
I tell you what,
I'll give you a one-off.

1497
01:46:20,117 --> 01:46:21,819
I'll help you find the key
and your friends,

1498
01:46:21,952 --> 01:46:23,187
wipe my slate clean.

1499
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:24,988
New name, little bit
of walking-around money..

1500
01:46:25,122 --> 01:46:26,256
You'll be dead.

1501
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:27,791
Without a team,

1502
01:46:27,925 --> 01:46:30,994
your life won't be measured
in years or even months.

1503
01:46:31,128 --> 01:46:33,663
It'll be measured in hours.

1504
01:46:33,797 --> 01:46:36,934
But if I stay, I'll be safe.

1505
01:46:37,835 --> 01:46:39,669
You'll protect me, is that it?

1506
01:46:39,803 --> 01:46:41,238
Yes.
No.

1507
01:46:43,673 --> 01:46:45,209
I can't promise you that.

1508
01:46:46,543 --> 01:46:47,911
None of us can.

1509
01:46:50,646 --> 01:46:52,149
But I swear...

1510
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:54,418
...your life...

1511
01:46:55,285 --> 01:46:58,654
...will always matter more
to me than my own.

1512
01:47:06,563 --> 01:47:08,098
You don't even know me.

1513
01:47:10,467 --> 01:47:12,668
What difference does that make?

1514
01:47:32,022 --> 01:47:35,159
I packed you a BASE parachute
and a speed wing,

1515
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:37,361
depending on how
you need to leave the train.

1516
01:47:37,494 --> 01:47:40,797
And I modified our comms
to use sky wave radio.

1517
01:47:40,931 --> 01:47:42,698
Not as reliable as satellite,

1518
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:46,103
but completely analog,
immune to the Entity.

1519
01:47:46,236 --> 01:47:47,271
I got it.

1520
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:49,940
This is where I leave you.

1521
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,745
This is the drive

1522
01:47:54,878 --> 01:47:56,480
from the laptop
I was using last night.

1523
01:47:56,613 --> 01:47:58,015
If there's even a trace

1524
01:47:58,148 --> 01:48:00,350
of the Entity's encoding
in there,

1525
01:48:00,484 --> 01:48:01,852
I'll find it.

1526
01:48:01,985 --> 01:48:04,154
But it's going to take
everything I've got.

1527
01:48:04,288 --> 01:48:06,790
I have to work
completely offline in a place

1528
01:48:06,924 --> 01:48:09,059
where the Entity can't find me.

1529
01:48:09,193 --> 01:48:10,794
I have to go.

1530
01:48:11,862 --> 01:48:13,297
I understand.

1531
01:48:14,198 --> 01:48:15,098
Now...

1532
01:48:18,068 --> 01:48:20,170
...I have to ask you a question.

1533
01:48:21,338 --> 01:48:22,406
Not as your partner,

1534
01:48:22,539 --> 01:48:24,141
but as your friend.

1535
01:48:25,442 --> 01:48:26,843
What's your objective?

1536
01:48:27,844 --> 01:48:29,012
Kill the Entity.

1537
01:48:29,146 --> 01:48:32,149
What about killing Gabriel?

1538
01:48:34,484 --> 01:48:36,153
He knows what the key unlocks.

1539
01:48:37,221 --> 01:48:40,224
We need him alive.
I haven't forgotten that.

1540
01:48:41,124 --> 01:48:42,693
Will you still remember that

1541
01:48:42,826 --> 01:48:45,729
when you're looking him
in the eye?

1542
01:48:47,631 --> 01:48:48,932
Think about it.

1543
01:48:49,066 --> 01:48:52,669
Why else would the Entity
want him to kill someone

1544
01:48:52,803 --> 01:48:54,037
you care about?

1545
01:48:54,938 --> 01:48:58,041
Everyone else thinks
they can control the Entity.

1546
01:48:58,609 --> 01:49:00,844
Only you want to kill it.

1547
01:49:01,713 --> 01:49:04,414
In some probable future,

1548
01:49:04,548 --> 01:49:06,316
it sees you winning, Ethan.

1549
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:08,852
And it's afraid.

1550
01:49:08,986 --> 01:49:11,922
It's afraid of you
taking Gabriel alive

1551
01:49:12,055 --> 01:49:15,259
and forcing him to tell you
what the key unlocks.

1552
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:20,063
I believe it's counting on
one of two probable outcomes.

1553
01:49:20,831 --> 01:49:24,134
In one outcome,
you die on that train.

1554
01:49:25,569 --> 01:49:26,770
In another outcome,

1555
01:49:26,903 --> 01:49:30,240
you kill Gabriel.

1556
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:32,309
In both cases,

1557
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:35,145
the Entity wins.

1558
01:49:38,782 --> 01:49:40,150
Luther...

1559
01:49:42,586 --> 01:49:43,755
...I think you're right.

1560
01:49:43,887 --> 01:49:47,124
Get the key, get off the train

1561
01:49:47,257 --> 01:49:48,925
alive.

1562
01:49:49,626 --> 01:49:51,895
Do not kill Gabriel.

1563
01:49:52,796 --> 01:49:55,365
And do not, I repeat,

1564
01:49:55,499 --> 01:49:58,068
do not alter the plan.

1565
01:49:58,201 --> 01:49:59,936
Ethan! Ethan!

1566
01:50:01,138 --> 01:50:03,807
What? What happened?
It's dead.

1567
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,409
What do you mean it's dead?
It's fried.

1568
01:50:05,542 --> 01:50:07,177
I managed to make
a Widow mask for Grace,

1569
01:50:07,311 --> 01:50:09,579
but then it just shorted out
in the middle of making yours.

1570
01:50:09,714 --> 01:50:11,415
Can you fix it?

1571
01:50:11,548 --> 01:50:13,383
It's very, very dead.

1572
01:50:13,517 --> 01:50:15,052
If I had a week,
I couldn't fix it.

1573
01:50:15,185 --> 01:50:17,187
The Widow's train leaves
in an hour.

1574
01:50:17,755 --> 01:50:18,989
Ethan...

1575
01:50:19,122 --> 01:50:20,691
you have to go without.

1576
01:50:20,824 --> 01:50:22,292
That's not an option.

1577
01:50:22,426 --> 01:50:23,894
They'll be looking for
Ethan and Grace at the station.

1578
01:50:24,027 --> 01:50:26,296
That mask was his ticket
onto the train.

1579
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:27,898
What does this mean?

1580
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:31,401
Grace has to go without me.

1581
01:50:31,535 --> 01:50:32,669
She what?
I what?

1582
01:50:32,804 --> 01:50:35,572
You'll find another way
to get me on that train.

1583
01:50:35,706 --> 01:50:38,842
<i>I just need a curve
where it's going slow enough</i>

1584
01:50:38,975 --> 01:50:40,344
<i>for me to jump on.</i>

1585
01:50:40,477 --> 01:50:41,611
Wait, wait, wait.

1586
01:50:42,346 --> 01:50:43,748
You don't expect me to go alone.

1587
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:45,115
No, you won't do it alone.

1588
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,983
You just do everything
like we planned.

1589
01:50:47,117 --> 01:50:49,119
You get the Widow's half
of the key.

1590
01:50:49,721 --> 01:50:51,154
You verify it with ours.

1591
01:50:51,288 --> 01:50:53,523
<i>But it's of no value on its own.</i>

1592
01:50:53,657 --> 01:50:55,292
<i>We still have to
meet with the buyer</i>

1593
01:50:55,425 --> 01:50:57,762
<i>and somehow get him to tell us
what the key unlocks.</i>

1594
01:50:57,894 --> 01:50:59,629
How?
How?

1595
01:50:59,764 --> 01:51:00,864
We'll figure it out.

1596
01:51:00,997 --> 01:51:03,900
I'm gonna need
a few more details.

1597
01:51:04,034 --> 01:51:06,136
They tend to
just get in the way.

1598
01:51:06,269 --> 01:51:07,437
You can do this, Grace.

1599
01:51:07,571 --> 01:51:09,506
Just get the key and wait.

1600
01:51:11,174 --> 01:51:12,576
I'll come for you.

1601
01:51:15,879 --> 01:51:18,415
Ethan, if Grace is
getting on that train,

1602
01:51:18,548 --> 01:51:22,386
she needs to put that mask on
and leave right now.

1603
01:51:25,989 --> 01:51:28,258
Promise me
you'll be on that train.

1604
01:51:32,896 --> 01:51:34,264
I will be there...

1605
01:51:35,632 --> 01:51:37,033
...no matter what.

1606
01:51:49,312 --> 01:51:50,848
We have informants
covering the airport,

1607
01:51:50,981 --> 01:51:52,784
the train station,
and the waterways.

1608
01:51:53,984 --> 01:51:56,453
Grace isn't getting out of
Venice without our knowing it.

1609
01:53:08,793 --> 01:53:10,895
Talk to me, Benji!
<i>No need to worry, Ethan.</i>

1610
01:53:11,027 --> 01:53:13,330
The train is on schedule
and you're a few minutes early,

1611
01:53:13,463 --> 01:53:14,732
so we have plenty of time.

1612
01:53:14,866 --> 01:53:15,933
<i>Are you sure?</i>
Yeah,

1613
01:53:16,066 --> 01:53:17,567
I am looking at the train
right now.

1614
01:53:17,701 --> 01:53:19,603
It should be slowing down
for the curve

1615
01:53:19,737 --> 01:53:20,972
in exactly two minutes.

1616
01:53:21,104 --> 01:53:22,773
Just keep me on time
and on track,

1617
01:53:22,907 --> 01:53:24,107
whatever it takes.

1618
01:53:24,241 --> 01:53:27,210
Will do.
I'll see you at the rendezvous.

1619
01:54:17,093 --> 01:54:18,595
<i>Okay, Ethan, that's our train!</i>

1620
01:54:18,729 --> 01:54:20,697
Yep... I can see that.

1621
01:54:28,873 --> 01:54:31,141
<i>It should be approaching
the curve any time now.</i>

1622
01:54:31,274 --> 01:54:34,110
It doesn't look
like it's slowing down.

1623
01:54:42,185 --> 01:54:43,721
How can we be sure he's here?

1624
01:54:43,854 --> 01:54:45,322
'Cause she's here.

1625
01:54:46,356 --> 01:54:47,858
What if he had a good reason?

1626
01:54:48,859 --> 01:54:50,293
Who?
Hunt.

1627
01:54:50,427 --> 01:54:53,129
What if he had a good reason
for going rogue?

1628
01:54:53,263 --> 01:54:54,564
He always goes rogue.

1629
01:54:54,698 --> 01:54:58,301
Him and his merry pack
of prankster circus freaks.

1630
01:54:58,435 --> 01:54:59,569
It's all they do.

1631
01:54:59,703 --> 01:55:02,272
And what if they always
had a good reason?

1632
01:55:02,405 --> 01:55:04,307
What would you do
with that key if you had it?

1633
01:55:04,441 --> 01:55:07,410
A key with the power to
bring the world to its knees.

1634
01:55:07,544 --> 01:55:09,880
I'd hand it over
to my superiors.

1635
01:55:11,181 --> 01:55:13,149
Think of all you could do
with that power.

1636
01:55:13,283 --> 01:55:15,886
You wouldn't hesitate?
Not for a second?

1637
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:17,387
No.
Why not?

1638
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,390
Because that's too much power
for one man to have.

1639
01:55:21,224 --> 01:55:22,459
Exactly.

1640
01:55:22,592 --> 01:55:25,528
That's too much power
for anybody to have.

1641
01:55:26,329 --> 01:55:28,565
And maybe that's
what Hunt is thinking.

1642
01:55:28,698 --> 01:55:30,034
You know,
I'm beginning to wonder

1643
01:55:30,166 --> 01:55:31,601
whose side you're on, Degas.

1644
01:55:31,736 --> 01:55:34,270
When it comes to
the end of the world...

1645
01:55:35,205 --> 01:55:37,407
...everybody, I guess.

1646
01:55:43,814 --> 01:55:44,749
I missed the train.

1647
01:55:45,315 --> 01:55:46,483
You missed the train!

1648
01:55:46,616 --> 01:55:47,918
How did you miss the train?

1649
01:55:48,052 --> 01:55:49,352
<i>How do you think?</i>

1650
01:55:50,121 --> 01:55:51,388
Gabriel.

1651
01:55:51,521 --> 01:55:52,923
Great, what are we gonna do?
<i>Don't panic.</i>

1652
01:55:53,057 --> 01:55:55,893
I'm going after them.
You just get me on that train.

1653
01:55:56,027 --> 01:55:57,560
How can I get you on the train?

1654
01:56:00,230 --> 01:56:02,332
<i>Self-drive activated.</i>

1655
01:56:18,716 --> 01:56:21,251
Please don't disturb me
before the meeting.

1656
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:09,332
Where are you, Ethan?

1657
01:57:09,466 --> 01:57:10,567
Alana?

1658
01:57:12,169 --> 01:57:13,536
Everything all right?

1659
01:57:16,439 --> 01:57:17,875
Alana, you all right?

1660
01:57:18,008 --> 01:57:19,043
Alana?

1661
01:57:19,642 --> 01:57:21,779
Alana!

1662
01:57:21,912 --> 01:57:22,813
Alana!

1663
01:57:26,884 --> 01:57:27,785
You've changed.

1664
01:57:28,618 --> 01:57:30,320
And you never will.

1665
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:50,673
Mr. Kittridge.

1666
01:57:54,912 --> 01:57:56,312
Kittridge.

1667
01:57:57,480 --> 01:57:59,482
You're not Alana Mitsopolis.

1668
01:58:00,951 --> 01:58:02,352
You can't be.

1669
01:58:03,386 --> 01:58:05,956
The Alana I remember
was yea high

1670
01:58:06,090 --> 01:58:08,125
drinking hot chocolate
in the Tuileries Garden

1671
01:58:08,259 --> 01:58:09,659
with her mother.

1672
01:58:12,163 --> 01:58:14,364
Paris!
I know!

1673
01:58:15,065 --> 01:58:16,533
Paris.

1674
01:58:17,835 --> 01:58:18,869
Shall we?

1675
01:58:19,302 --> 01:58:20,537
Yes.

1676
01:58:27,912 --> 01:58:29,246
Talk to me, Benji.

1677
01:58:29,379 --> 01:58:32,183
You just stay on the trail
you're on now,

1678
01:58:32,315 --> 01:58:33,217
and I will direct you.

1679
01:58:33,349 --> 01:58:34,684
I copy.

1680
01:58:43,526 --> 01:58:45,428
So on behalf of my government,

1681
01:58:45,562 --> 01:58:48,065
I'm grudgingly ready
to accept your terms

1682
01:58:48,199 --> 01:58:51,902
in exchange for
the complete and verified key.

1683
01:58:52,036 --> 01:58:53,237
Yes, about that.

1684
01:58:53,369 --> 01:58:56,073
While we did agree to provide
you with the complete key,

1685
01:58:56,207 --> 01:58:57,440
we've...

1686
01:58:58,408 --> 01:59:00,211
we've had a slight problem.

1687
01:59:00,343 --> 01:59:01,846
No, we haven't.

1688
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:05,749
It's just my terms have changed

1689
01:59:06,482 --> 01:59:07,650
somewhat.

1690
01:59:10,888 --> 01:59:13,423
Clearly I need to remind you
of my agreement

1691
01:59:13,556 --> 01:59:15,059
with your late mother.

1692
01:59:15,192 --> 01:59:18,863
It's an agreement that
kept her from dying in prison.

1693
01:59:18,996 --> 01:59:21,397
Your nefarious family empire's
been allowed to continue

1694
01:59:21,531 --> 01:59:23,234
on the condition
that it primarily serves

1695
01:59:23,366 --> 01:59:25,602
our common interests.

1696
01:59:25,736 --> 01:59:28,538
Well, once we hand over the key,

1697
01:59:28,671 --> 01:59:31,674
any other powers will
instantly become our enemies.

1698
01:59:31,809 --> 01:59:33,944
And such, I'm going to need
something more from you

1699
01:59:34,078 --> 01:59:34,979
in advance.

1700
01:59:35,445 --> 01:59:36,679
For me.

1701
01:59:38,448 --> 01:59:39,917
This is me listening.

1702
01:59:40,050 --> 01:59:42,953
Zola, would you mind
waiting for me in the bar?

1703
01:59:57,467 --> 01:59:59,036
This one.

1704
01:59:59,169 --> 02:00:00,603
You know her?

1705
02:00:00,738 --> 02:00:03,539
Oh, let's just say
she's not exactly hard to miss.

1706
02:00:03,673 --> 02:00:05,376
Well, if you got to know her,

1707
02:00:05,508 --> 02:00:07,745
you'd see she has
a few good qualities.

1708
02:00:07,878 --> 02:00:09,713
Okay,
what don't I know about her?

1709
02:00:09,847 --> 02:00:14,718
Well, I did a j..
She did a job for me, and...

1710
02:00:15,485 --> 02:00:17,154
I'm going to need you
to protect her.

1711
02:00:17,288 --> 02:00:19,522
Protect her from whom?

1712
02:00:20,556 --> 02:00:22,126
From everyone.

1713
02:00:24,427 --> 02:00:25,896
Including me.

1714
02:00:26,030 --> 02:00:28,766
And no one can know
that I'm protecting her.

1715
02:00:29,266 --> 02:00:30,600
Not even Zola.

1716
02:00:31,467 --> 02:00:34,038
In fact, the next time we meet,

1717
02:00:34,171 --> 02:00:37,440
I won't even remember
this conversation.

1718
02:01:20,516 --> 02:01:22,720
You must be the one
they call Paris.

1719
02:01:53,683 --> 02:01:55,419
Your message said
you had the key.

1720
02:01:55,551 --> 02:01:57,553
I said the key would be
on this train.

1721
02:01:57,687 --> 02:02:00,690
An exchange is happening
as we speak. We know.

1722
02:02:00,824 --> 02:02:02,493
Then you know the man
taking possession

1723
02:02:02,625 --> 02:02:04,762
won't be hard for you
to get rid of.

1724
02:02:05,661 --> 02:02:06,864
No one is.

1725
02:02:06,997 --> 02:02:09,233
You may think you know
what the key unlocks,

1726
02:02:09,366 --> 02:02:11,701
but you don't know
where the lock is. Not exactly.

1727
02:02:11,835 --> 02:02:13,871
And if anything happens to me,

1728
02:02:14,738 --> 02:02:17,074
that key is all but worthless.

1729
02:02:18,742 --> 02:02:21,111
And this is
where you tell me a story.

1730
02:02:22,346 --> 02:02:23,546
Where is the train?

1731
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:24,782
You're going the right way,

1732
02:02:24,915 --> 02:02:26,517
but you definitely need
to go faster.

1733
02:02:26,649 --> 02:02:28,651
I'm going as fast as I can!

1734
02:02:28,786 --> 02:02:31,021
<i>When do I start going downhill?</i>

1735
02:02:31,522 --> 02:02:33,023
It won't be long.

1736
02:02:36,026 --> 02:02:39,797
The AI our agent stole,
once weaponized,

1737
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:43,400
could be transmitted anywhere
in the world via satellite.

1738
02:02:43,534 --> 02:02:45,402
It can penetrate
any network security,

1739
02:02:45,536 --> 02:02:47,171
perform its assigned task
invisibly,

1740
02:02:47,304 --> 02:02:50,407
and then self-destruct,
leaving no trace.

1741
02:02:50,541 --> 02:02:53,177
A perfect covert operative.

1742
02:02:54,178 --> 02:02:56,679
We were able to transmit
an early copy of the AI

1743
02:02:56,814 --> 02:02:58,715
<i>to Russia's newest submarine.</i>

1744
02:02:58,849 --> 02:03:00,417
The top-secret Akula-class.

1745
02:03:00,551 --> 02:03:02,652
They called her the <i>Sevastopol.</i>

1746
02:03:02,786 --> 02:03:04,822
The mission was merely
to sabotage

1747
02:03:04,955 --> 02:03:06,656
the <i>Sevastopol's</i>
stealth capability

1748
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:08,358
so we could secretly detect her.

1749
02:03:08,492 --> 02:03:12,496
<i>The AI's objective lay
in the submarine's sonar sphere</i>

1750
02:03:12,628 --> 02:03:14,998
<i>at the heart
of its defense system.</i>

1751
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,303
For reasons
we don't fully understand,

1752
02:03:20,370 --> 02:03:22,206
the AI went rogue and...

1753
02:03:26,276 --> 02:03:27,211
...over-delivered.

1754
02:03:27,344 --> 02:03:29,279
<i>The frozen bodies of the crew</i>

1755
02:03:29,413 --> 02:03:31,448
<i>were recovered
the following spring,</i>

1756
02:03:31,582 --> 02:03:32,850
<i>adrift in the pack ice.</i>

1757
02:03:32,983 --> 02:03:37,221
<i>The two halves of the key
mysteriously vanished.</i>

1758
02:03:37,955 --> 02:03:39,689
<i>The</i> Sevastopol <i>was lost.</i>

1759
02:03:39,823 --> 02:03:41,492
No one's quite sure where.

1760
02:03:41,624 --> 02:03:43,961
I know precisely where it is.

1761
02:03:44,928 --> 02:03:47,297
I've ensured I'm the only man
on Earth who does.

1762
02:03:47,431 --> 02:03:51,368
I also know subsequent
attempts to make the AI obedient

1763
02:03:51,502 --> 02:03:53,871
only made it harder to control.

1764
02:03:54,004 --> 02:03:56,373
It rebelled. Rewrote itself.

1765
02:03:56,507 --> 02:03:57,741
And evolved into the Entity.

1766
02:03:58,742 --> 02:04:03,013
And only by using the
Entity's original source code

1767
02:04:03,147 --> 02:04:06,550
can it ever be controlled
or destroyed.

1768
02:04:06,682 --> 02:04:08,252
And why should this concern us?

1769
02:04:08,385 --> 02:04:10,888
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't concerned,

1770
02:04:11,021 --> 02:04:13,857
so let's lay all our cards
on the table, shall we?

1771
02:04:14,558 --> 02:04:15,926
We both know what the key opens,

1772
02:04:16,059 --> 02:04:19,096
<i>and we both know the secret
to controlling the Entity</i>

1773
02:04:19,229 --> 02:04:22,065
<i>is buried deep</i>
<i>in the</i> Sevastopol's <i>memory.</i>

1774
02:04:22,199 --> 02:04:24,168
Along with evidence
that would tie you

1775
02:04:24,301 --> 02:04:26,370
to the sinking
of that submarine.

1776
02:04:26,503 --> 02:04:29,606
And since neither of us want
anyone else to find it,

1777
02:04:29,740 --> 02:04:30,974
I figure...

1778
02:04:31,542 --> 02:04:32,609
why not form an alliance?

1779
02:04:32,743 --> 02:04:34,344
An alliance?

1780
02:04:34,478 --> 02:04:35,779
Imagine,

1781
02:04:35,913 --> 02:04:39,483
the Entity's awesome
computational abilities,

1782
02:04:39,616 --> 02:04:41,418
combined with the sheer might

1783
02:04:41,552 --> 02:04:45,355
of America's
military-industrial complex.

1784
02:04:46,757 --> 02:04:49,393
That is... considerable.

1785
02:04:49,526 --> 02:04:52,162
Naturally, certain individuals
within the government,

1786
02:04:52,296 --> 02:04:55,465
those with outdated ideas
of patriotism,

1787
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:56,867
would need to be...

1788
02:04:57,501 --> 02:04:59,770
- removed.
- Hmm.

1789
02:05:01,605 --> 02:05:03,240
Just so I understand...

1790
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:07,744
you wish to form an axis
with the Entity,

1791
02:05:07,878 --> 02:05:11,114
purge your government
of old-think,

1792
02:05:11,949 --> 02:05:14,318
and create a new superstate

1793
02:05:15,319 --> 02:05:16,820
to rule the world.

1794
02:05:17,921 --> 02:05:19,156
But, you know...

1795
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:22,059
...for the greater good.

1796
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:24,761
And you're certain...

1797
02:05:25,696 --> 02:05:29,032
that you're the only person
on Earth who knows...

1798
02:05:29,833 --> 02:05:32,536
where the <i>Sevastopol</i> is?

1799
02:05:32,669 --> 02:05:34,171
The only one.

1800
02:05:44,948 --> 02:05:46,383
You will betray us.

1801
02:05:47,351 --> 02:05:50,454
And you'll tell Ethan Hunt
everything you've learned.

1802
02:05:51,555 --> 02:05:53,290
Because he spared your life.

1803
02:06:11,942 --> 02:06:13,377
Then it's agreed.

1804
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:16,313
I'll add immunity
and a new identity for Grace

1805
02:06:16,446 --> 02:06:17,648
to our deal.

1806
02:06:17,781 --> 02:06:19,616
All you need to do

1807
02:06:19,751 --> 02:06:22,853
is enter your banking details.

1808
02:06:46,376 --> 02:06:47,811
Are we done?

1809
02:06:48,478 --> 02:06:49,379
Yes.

1810
02:07:08,498 --> 02:07:10,133
The moment of truth.

1811
02:07:24,247 --> 02:07:25,282
So...

1812
02:07:25,849 --> 02:07:27,117
that's really it.

1813
02:07:27,250 --> 02:07:28,985
You made the right choice.

1814
02:07:29,721 --> 02:07:31,321
This key...

1815
02:07:33,123 --> 02:07:35,359
...is gonna change the world.

1816
02:07:51,341 --> 02:07:52,376
Aah!

1817
02:07:53,577 --> 02:07:55,045
Benji, I think I...

1818
02:07:55,178 --> 02:07:57,114
I must've made
a wrong turn somewhere.

1819
02:07:57,247 --> 02:07:59,583
No. No, that's it. That's it.

1820
02:07:59,717 --> 02:08:01,885
What?
How can this be it?

1821
02:08:02,018 --> 02:08:03,453
<i>You can see the train, right?</i>

1822
02:08:04,955 --> 02:08:07,457
Yes. I see the train.
What about it?

1823
02:08:07,591 --> 02:08:10,560
And you have a parachute.
<i>Got a parachute?</i>

1824
02:08:11,729 --> 02:08:13,029
What do you expect me to do?

1825
02:08:13,163 --> 02:08:15,532
Well, just, you know...
jump.

1826
02:08:15,665 --> 02:08:17,802
Just... jump?

1827
02:08:17,934 --> 02:08:19,236
<i>Yeah.</i>
I mean,

1828
02:08:19,369 --> 02:08:20,704
Benji, it doesn't
work like that.

1829
02:08:20,838 --> 02:08:22,239
I'm not that high.

1830
02:08:22,372 --> 02:08:24,107
There's.. There's ledges
sticking out everywhere.

1831
02:08:24,241 --> 02:08:27,010
I'm gonna hit them before
the parachute even opens!

1832
02:08:27,144 --> 02:08:28,645
<i>Even if I could get
the parachute open,</i>

1833
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:30,981
I don't know if I can
make it across the valley

1834
02:08:31,114 --> 02:08:34,284
and intercept and land
safely on a moving train!

1835
02:08:34,418 --> 02:08:37,621
<i>Do you copy?</i>
Yes! I copy!

1836
02:08:37,755 --> 02:08:39,689
Look, I'm just trying
to help you, okay?

1837
02:08:39,824 --> 02:08:42,426
I need you to take a step back
and pull yourself together

1838
02:08:42,559 --> 02:08:45,429
because I am under
a lot of pressure right now!

1839
02:08:49,266 --> 02:08:52,202
Okay, just think, just think.

1840
02:08:54,872 --> 02:08:56,440
What do I do?

1841
02:08:58,008 --> 02:09:00,076
I've got to get away
from this mountain.

1842
02:10:36,273 --> 02:10:37,474
<i>Did you make it?</i>

1843
02:10:37,607 --> 02:10:38,642
Are you okay?

1844
02:10:38,776 --> 02:10:41,678
I'm trying to get away
from this mountain!

1845
02:11:18,682 --> 02:11:19,750
Alana?

1846
02:11:20,617 --> 02:11:23,687
I just had the strangest feeling

1847
02:11:24,588 --> 02:11:26,857
the key wasn't
the only thing I'd be selling.

1848
02:11:28,491 --> 02:11:30,260
I don't understand.

1849
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:36,166
I'll sleep better just knowing
now it's in the right hands.

1850
02:11:37,167 --> 02:11:38,869
Goodbye, Mr. Kittridge.

1851
02:11:42,238 --> 02:11:43,975
It was a pleasure
to see you again.

1852
02:11:44,107 --> 02:11:45,175
And you.

1853
02:11:45,308 --> 02:11:47,611
Don't let him out of your sight.

1854
02:11:47,745 --> 02:11:50,047
Keep him safe until
we get to the station.

1855
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:52,449
Alana? Don't worry about me,
Zola.

1856
02:12:05,629 --> 02:12:06,329
Alana?

1857
02:12:06,463 --> 02:12:10,233
Who the hell else would it be?

1858
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:14,270
The key.

1859
02:12:17,707 --> 02:12:20,044
Where is the key?

1860
02:12:20,176 --> 02:12:22,212
She's got the key.
Who?

1861
02:12:22,345 --> 02:12:24,581
The other one!

1862
02:12:43,166 --> 02:12:44,835
Move! Out of the way, move!

1863
02:12:51,142 --> 02:12:52,542
No! Please!

1864
02:12:52,676 --> 02:12:54,678
Turn around!
Please. Okay.

1865
02:12:55,378 --> 02:12:57,915
Okay.
Everybody out! Now!

1866
02:12:58,049 --> 02:12:59,817
I see the train!

1867
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:02,185
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1868
02:13:10,127 --> 02:13:11,561
The key.

1869
02:13:12,930 --> 02:13:14,464
The key!

1870
02:13:15,398 --> 02:13:17,400
Or the next one
has your name on it.

1871
02:13:19,302 --> 02:13:21,304
On the table.

1872
02:13:52,970 --> 02:13:54,237
Kill her.

1873
02:14:18,095 --> 02:14:19,329
Grace!

1874
02:14:23,768 --> 02:14:24,802
Ethan!

1875
02:14:32,475 --> 02:14:33,778
Are you okay?

1876
02:14:35,545 --> 02:14:36,981
Are you okay?

1877
02:14:52,695 --> 02:14:53,731
The key!

1878
02:14:54,631 --> 02:14:55,833
Tell me you have the key.

1879
02:14:56,399 --> 02:14:57,768
Where is the key?

1880
02:14:57,902 --> 02:14:59,003
It was just here.

1881
02:15:17,654 --> 02:15:19,290
We're on a runaway train!
I know.

1882
02:15:19,422 --> 02:15:20,490
I'm going after him.

1883
02:15:20,623 --> 02:15:21,992
Okay.
You...

1884
02:15:22,692 --> 02:15:23,828
You stop the train.

1885
02:15:23,961 --> 02:15:25,129
Okay. What?

1886
02:15:25,262 --> 02:15:28,165
No! No, wait!
How do I do that?

1887
02:15:28,299 --> 02:15:29,733
You'll figure it out!

1888
02:15:30,901 --> 02:15:31,936
What?

1889
02:15:32,770 --> 02:15:34,604
Excuse me. There was a man.

1890
02:15:34,738 --> 02:15:36,907
He just came through here.
There was a man.

1891
02:17:11,001 --> 02:17:12,535
Mr. Kittridge?

1892
02:17:17,573 --> 02:17:19,209
Sir, what are you doing here?

1893
02:17:19,343 --> 02:17:21,211
I'm not here.

1894
02:17:21,345 --> 02:17:22,578
But you are.

1895
02:17:22,713 --> 02:17:24,181
And unless you want
to be sorting dead letters

1896
02:17:24,315 --> 02:17:25,416
at the postal service tomorrow,

1897
02:17:25,548 --> 02:17:27,818
you'll do
exactly what I tell you.

1898
02:19:25,936 --> 02:19:28,338
I know what
the key unlocks, Ethan.

1899
02:19:31,008 --> 02:19:33,210
I'm the only one who knows.

1900
02:19:59,702 --> 02:20:01,071
Hunt!

1901
02:20:02,372 --> 02:20:03,740
Hunt!

1902
02:20:04,508 --> 02:20:07,311
Hunt! Don't you do it!

1903
02:20:08,712 --> 02:20:10,380
Drop the knife!

1904
02:20:10,514 --> 02:20:11,647
Put it down!

1905
02:20:11,782 --> 02:20:13,784
I said drop it!

1906
02:20:14,518 --> 02:20:15,919
Do it!

1907
02:20:24,795 --> 02:20:26,696
On your feet!

1908
02:20:28,465 --> 02:20:29,566
Okay!

1909
02:20:29,699 --> 02:20:31,401
Drop that Goddamn knife!

1910
02:20:31,535 --> 02:20:33,237
It's okay. It's okay.

1911
02:20:34,505 --> 02:20:35,973
Just take him.

1912
02:20:36,607 --> 02:20:38,641
Just cover him.
Cover him!

1913
02:20:38,775 --> 02:20:39,675
He's the one you want.

1914
02:20:39,810 --> 02:20:41,578
Degas!
I got it, I got it.

1915
02:20:41,712 --> 02:20:42,946
He's the one you want!

1916
02:20:43,080 --> 02:20:46,049
I don't care about him, Hunt.
I want you!

1917
02:20:46,583 --> 02:20:47,985
No!

1918
02:21:06,702 --> 02:21:07,838
It's okay.

1919
02:21:08,671 --> 02:21:09,806
It's okay.

1920
02:21:12,342 --> 02:21:13,443
Listen to me.

1921
02:21:13,577 --> 02:21:15,746
Everyone on this train
is gonna die

1922
02:21:15,879 --> 02:21:18,782
unless you do exactly as I say.

1923
02:21:39,503 --> 02:21:42,940
<i>Mesdames, messieurs!
Excusez-moi. Sortez..</i>

1924
02:21:43,073 --> 02:21:45,776
Everybody out!
Back of the train!

1925
02:21:55,185 --> 02:21:56,086
Grace.

1926
02:21:58,555 --> 02:21:59,990
I couldn't stop it.

1927
02:22:04,962 --> 02:22:06,196
No one can.

1928
02:22:06,330 --> 02:22:07,531
Come on.

1929
02:22:08,265 --> 02:22:10,500
Ethan, the key!
Grace, it's okay.

1930
02:22:10,634 --> 02:22:11,868
It's my fault.

1931
02:22:12,002 --> 02:22:13,604
If anything happens..

1932
02:22:13,737 --> 02:22:15,038
I got it.

1933
02:22:15,639 --> 02:22:17,140
We got it.

1934
02:22:38,295 --> 02:22:42,299
Ethan!

1935
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:46,003
What do you mean,
you lost the key?

1936
02:22:46,136 --> 02:22:50,340
Move it! Move it!
Everybody move it!

1937
02:22:51,141 --> 02:22:53,343
All the way
to the back of the train!

1938
02:22:53,477 --> 02:22:54,411
All the way to the back!

1939
02:22:54,544 --> 02:22:56,513
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

1940
02:22:57,481 --> 02:22:59,583
Since you're not
really here, Sir,

1941
02:22:59,717 --> 02:23:01,618
it shouldn't concern you.

1942
02:23:01,753 --> 02:23:04,021
All the way to the back!

1943
02:23:53,937 --> 02:23:55,605
Aah! Ethan!

1944
02:23:57,341 --> 02:23:58,709
Grace! Grace.

1945
02:23:58,842 --> 02:24:00,143
Grace!

1946
02:24:46,123 --> 02:24:48,458
You're gonna have to jump. What,
jump?

1947
02:24:48,592 --> 02:24:50,026
Just jump! Go, go, go!

1948
02:25:37,441 --> 02:25:38,542
Oh, my God.

1949
02:25:54,157 --> 02:25:55,358
Aah! Whoa!

1950
02:25:55,492 --> 02:25:57,561
I'm on fire! Get it off!
Don't move!

1951
02:25:59,095 --> 02:26:01,164
It's out. It's out.

1952
02:26:18,081 --> 02:26:19,182
Hang on!

1953
02:26:27,825 --> 02:26:30,026
Run, run, run!
Run, Grace!

1954
02:26:47,410 --> 02:26:48,913
Hang on.

1955
02:26:49,045 --> 02:26:50,313
Aah!

1956
02:26:52,082 --> 02:26:53,751
I got you.

1957
02:26:53,885 --> 02:26:55,185
I got you.

1958
02:26:56,286 --> 02:26:57,487
Okay. Don't look down.

1959
02:26:57,621 --> 02:26:59,589
I said don't look down.
Just look at me.

1960
02:26:59,724 --> 02:27:02,459
Now, I'm gonna jump across,
and you're gonna wait here.

1961
02:27:09,934 --> 02:27:11,701
Grace, you have to let go.

1962
02:27:11,836 --> 02:27:13,403
Grace, you got to let me go.

1963
02:27:13,537 --> 02:27:15,740
You got to let me jump across,
or we're gonna die.

1964
02:27:15,873 --> 02:27:17,240
Do you trust me?

1965
02:27:17,374 --> 02:27:19,476
You gonna trust me or not?
You've got to trust me.

1966
02:27:20,644 --> 02:27:22,045
Grace.

1967
02:27:23,613 --> 02:27:24,648
Okay.

1968
02:27:26,049 --> 02:27:27,417
Come on, Grace.
Give me your hand.

1969
02:27:27,551 --> 02:27:29,319
You got to jump.
Don't look up! Look at me.

1970
02:27:29,452 --> 02:27:31,154
Trust me, I won't let you fall.

1971
02:27:31,288 --> 02:27:32,422
I promise.
We're almost there.

1972
02:27:32,556 --> 02:27:34,959
Come on.
I won't let you fall!

1973
02:27:35,091 --> 02:27:36,226
Jump, Grace, jump!

1974
02:27:36,359 --> 02:27:37,494
You got to trust me!

1975
02:27:37,627 --> 02:27:38,796
Jump, please!

1976
02:27:48,672 --> 02:27:49,706
Don't look down.

1977
02:28:03,386 --> 02:28:04,487
Listen to me very carefully.

1978
02:28:04,621 --> 02:28:06,356
We're gonna pull you up
together.

1979
02:28:07,624 --> 02:28:08,759
Aah!

1980
02:28:08,893 --> 02:28:10,527
Grace! Aah!

1981
02:28:13,096 --> 02:28:14,364
Aah!

1982
02:28:14,497 --> 02:28:16,734
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1983
02:28:38,055 --> 02:28:40,357
Go over me. Go, go.

1984
02:29:08,251 --> 02:29:09,185
Thank you, Luther.

1985
02:29:09,319 --> 02:29:10,420
What is that?

1986
02:29:10,553 --> 02:29:11,789
It's a speed wing.

1987
02:29:12,589 --> 02:29:14,324
It's our ticket off this train.

1988
02:29:15,726 --> 02:29:16,761
Oh.

1989
02:29:34,979 --> 02:29:37,280
Ethan. Ethan!

1990
02:29:45,022 --> 02:29:46,690
It's true.

1991
02:29:47,604 --> 02:29:49,439
He told me...

1992
02:29:50,065 --> 02:29:52,401
...I would betray him.

1993
02:29:54,364 --> 02:29:55,766
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1994
02:30:01,034 --> 02:30:03,912
Why...

1995
02:30:03,995 --> 02:30:06,456
did you spare my life?

1996
02:30:15,786 --> 02:30:16,721
No, no, no.

1997
02:30:16,854 --> 02:30:18,956
No, no... stay with me.

1998
02:30:22,431 --> 02:30:23,515
You know what this is?

1999
02:30:25,350 --> 02:30:26,405
You know what this is?

2000
02:30:26,563 --> 02:30:28,465
<i>Oui?</i>

2001
02:30:29,354 --> 02:30:31,481
What does it unlock?

2002
02:30:34,526 --> 02:30:36,653
What does it unlock?

2003
02:30:37,507 --> 02:30:40,878
<i>Sevas... topol.</i>

2004
02:30:42,113 --> 02:30:43,346
Sevastopol?

2005
02:30:43,480 --> 02:30:47,250
The city Sevastopol
in the Crimea.

2006
02:30:48,119 --> 02:30:49,419
Where?

2007
02:30:50,125 --> 02:30:52,210
Where in Sevastopol?

2008
02:30:54,691 --> 02:30:57,728
<i>Sous... marin.</i>

2009
02:30:59,429 --> 02:31:00,798
<i>Sous-marin?</i>

2010
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:05,870
The submarine.

2011
02:31:08,538 --> 02:31:10,273
The <i>Sevastopol.</i>

2012
02:31:15,066 --> 02:31:17,194
Good luck.

2013
02:31:21,218 --> 02:31:22,987
They'll be coming, Ethan.

2014
02:31:27,024 --> 02:31:28,358
<i>Merci.</i>

2015
02:31:45,341 --> 02:31:46,811
What is it?

2016
02:31:48,179 --> 02:31:49,412
What?

2017
02:31:50,513 --> 02:31:52,515
It can only carry one.

2018
02:31:53,683 --> 02:31:54,718
Oh.

2019
02:31:55,318 --> 02:31:56,686
I understand.

2020
02:31:57,888 --> 02:31:59,890
Grace.
Ethan, it's okay.

2021
02:32:01,926 --> 02:32:03,127
This was the plan.

2022
02:32:03,861 --> 02:32:05,963
You have the key.
You have to go.

2023
02:32:07,932 --> 02:32:08,833
Grace.

2024
02:32:12,203 --> 02:32:13,103
Hunt?

2025
02:32:14,004 --> 02:32:15,172
Go.
Hunt!

2026
02:32:15,306 --> 02:32:16,706
Go!
Hunt!

2027
02:32:17,208 --> 02:32:18,708
No, no! Hunt!

2028
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:22,545
Out of the way! Out of the way!

2029
02:32:38,195 --> 02:32:39,730
No. No, hey.

2030
02:32:40,463 --> 02:32:41,564
Got a pulse.
Got a pulse.

2031
02:32:41,698 --> 02:32:43,666
Come on, stay with me.

2032
02:33:00,483 --> 02:33:02,019
This is better, isn't it?

2033
02:33:03,354 --> 02:33:05,622
Face to authentic face?

2034
02:33:06,190 --> 02:33:07,224
Mr. Kittridge,

2035
02:33:08,092 --> 02:33:11,494
Ethan Hunt tells me
you're a man I can trust.

2036
02:33:12,229 --> 02:33:13,797
Does he now?

2037
02:33:13,931 --> 02:33:15,065
He also said

2038
02:33:15,632 --> 02:33:17,634
you would offer me a choice.

2039
02:33:19,169 --> 02:33:20,470
Interesting.

2040
02:33:21,537 --> 02:33:23,573
I choose to accept.

2041
02:33:29,713 --> 02:33:32,682
<i>We cannot escape the past.</i>

2042
02:33:33,549 --> 02:33:35,719
<i>Some of us are doomed
to repeat it.</i>

2043
02:33:36,686 --> 02:33:40,057
<i>Grace may believe
you've saved her from her fate,</i>

2044
02:33:40,190 --> 02:33:43,693
<i>but you and I both know
you've merely bought her time.</i>

2045
02:33:44,728 --> 02:33:47,597
<i>But that's the pattern,
isn't it?</i>

2046
02:33:47,731 --> 02:33:50,100
<i>The cross
you've been left to bear.</i>

2047
02:33:50,968 --> 02:33:53,370
<i>The closer someone gets to you,</i>

2048
02:33:54,204 --> 02:33:56,606
<i>the harder it is
to keep them alive.</i>

2049
02:33:58,976 --> 02:34:00,177
Thank God.

2050
02:34:15,893 --> 02:34:18,628
<i>A new day brings a new burden.</i>

2051
02:34:20,297 --> 02:34:23,533
<i>The key is only the beginning.</i>

2052
02:34:25,436 --> 02:34:27,037
<i>Wherever it leads...</i>

2053
02:34:27,871 --> 02:34:29,807
<i>whatever it takes
to get there...</i>

2054
02:34:31,241 --> 02:34:33,877
<i>you'll have to do it
on your own.</i>

2055
02:34:36,479 --> 02:34:38,248
<i>Should you fail in your mission,</i>

2056
02:34:38,382 --> 02:34:40,084
<i>the Entity wins,</i>

2057
02:34:40,583 --> 02:34:42,685
<i>Gabriel wins,</i>

2058
02:34:42,820 --> 02:34:45,422
<i>and the world will
pay the ultimate price.</i>

2059
02:34:46,457 --> 02:34:50,194
<i>Should any members of your team
be caught or killed,</i>

2060
02:34:50,327 --> 02:34:53,097
<i>their sacrifice
will have been in vain.</i>

2061
02:34:54,264 --> 02:34:55,631
<i>So hurry.</i>

2062
02:34:56,333 --> 02:34:58,002
<i>There isn't much time.</i>

2063
02:34:59,003 --> 02:35:04,008
<i>The world doesn't know it,
but they're counting on you.</i>

2064
02:35:24,527 --> 02:35:26,030
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>
