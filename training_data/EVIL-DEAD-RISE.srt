1
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,960
What the fuck, Caleb?

2
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,800
Oh, wait till you see the shot I got.

3
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,216
You looked like you were gonna
shit a brick out sideways.

4
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,640
You could have taken my head off.

5
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
It wouldn't have been a clean
decapitation with these blades.

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,480
You'd just scramble
your face up real good.

7
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,560
Shouldn't you go see
if Jessica is feeling any better?

8
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,480
She'll be fine. I gave her Klonopin

9
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,120
so she can sleep off
whatever the fuck is wrong with her.

10
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,400
Girl is such a pain in the ass.

11
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,280
Jessica?

12
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Hey.

13
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,000
How you feeling, cuz?

14
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,800
Since none of these other friends
of yours bothered to show up

15
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,480
can I take your car and escape
the hell of being stuck here

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
with your latest boyfriend?

17
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
Great chat.

18
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,616
You better wake up
in the next half hour

19
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,120
or I'm gonna be forced

20
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,000
to go drown that brainless
meat puppet's sorry ass.

21
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,600
"The intense horror
of my nightmare came over me.

22
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,760
I tried to draw back my arm,
but the hand clung on

23
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,960
and a most melancholy voice sobbed

24
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,680
'Let me in.

25
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
Let me in!'

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,360
As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely

27
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,800
a child's face
looking through the window.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,040
Finding it useless to attempt
shaking the creature off

29
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,440
I pulled its wrist on to
the broken pane...

30
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,080
- Jess? Please shut up.
- And rubbed it to

31
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,360
and fro

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,400
till the blood ran down
and soaked the bedclothes.

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,400
Yet still it wailed...

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,520
'Let me in!'"

35
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,680
Jessica!

36
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,560
Shit... shit!

37
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,200
No, Jess. Jess? Jess? Jess?

38
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
Who's the brainless meat puppet now?

39
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
Caleb.

40
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880
What the fuck?

41
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Oh, my God.

42
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,000
What the hell happened?

43
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
Jess?

44
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Jessica?

45
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,080
What the fuck? What?

46
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,360
No, no, no...

47
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
Caleb!

48
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,400
No...

49
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,080
No, Caleb!

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,880
Caleb!

51
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Beth!

52
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,560
Beth, you in there?

53
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
Just give me five, all right?

54
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,520
Brandon is losing his shit.

55
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,640
He can't find the Strat

56
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,880
he won in that
arm wrestling contest last night.

57
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
It's already tuned
and racked, stage left,

58
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
like I told you
it was half an hour ago.

59
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
You feeling all right in there?

60
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,800
I'm fine.

61
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,800
Just go man your station.

62
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,400
I'll be back before curtains up.

63
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,120
You got it, boss.

64
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,856
Have you seen
my favorite black T-shirt?

65
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,640
I need it for
the Labor Day protest tomorrow.

66
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Mom?

67
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,880
You're not going to any protest
on your own.

68
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,720
Sophie's dad's taking us.

69
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,056
I've told you, like,
ten times already.

70
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Remember?

71
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,400
Well, did you remember
to check the bathroom hamper?

72
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
Tell Danny to turn the music down.

73
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Mom says, "Turn the music down!"

74
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,880
I could've done that myself!

75
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,920
Kassie, you better
not have my scissors.

76
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
Don't got 'em, Mom!

77
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
It's dirty.

78
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,216
Well, stick it in the laundry,
and I'll do it later.

79
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,920
You'll forget. You always forget.

80
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
You know
where the washing machine is.

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,680
Hey, Bridget. Mom's on nights

82
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,720
and we're watching
all the Freddy movies in a row.

83
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,960
Even the shitty ones.

84
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,480
There aren't any shitty ones.

85
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,760
So, you... wanna come over and...

86
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
In your dreams.

87
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,560
Your boyfriends are weirdos.

88
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,040
You're the weirdo.

89
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,320
Kassie!

90
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,520
Big crowd in tonight, Dan?

91
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,600
Get out, Bridge!

92
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
I would, but...

93
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
Let me in!

94
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,760
Somebody get that, please!

95
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,920
All right, all right!

96
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Boo!

97
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Beth.

98
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
You bitch.

99
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
Surprise, sis.

100
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,680
When did you get into town?

101
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,680
I Uber'd straight here from LAX.

102
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,160
You been sleeping? You look like Mom.

103
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,880
Beats looking like a tampon.

104
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,800
You know, the downstairs buzzer
is totally busted.

105
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,560
I was able to walk in
right off the street.

106
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,320
Whole building's busted.
It's getting knocked in a month.

107
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,040
You're kidding me.

108
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,760
Nope. We're out.

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,960
Have you guys found a new place?

110
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Not yet.

111
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,560
Shit, El. You and Jay
have been here forever.

112
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,320
Was Bangkok awesome?

113
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,360
Insane. Crazy,
obsessive fans over there.

114
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,480
Did you drink snake blood?

115
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,200
Hey, that's culturally insensitive.

116
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,280
What about monkey brain barbecue?

117
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, yeah. That's so much better, Dan.

118
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,320
Who's your friend, Kass?

119
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,040
She's called Staffanie.

120
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
Oh. Hey, Staffanie.

121
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,680
What's her situation?

122
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,000
Danny told me that
when this building used to be a bank

123
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,480
a teller got caught stealing
and hunged himself

124
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,376
and if you walk around
with coins in your pockets

125
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,880
his ghost hears the jingle.

126
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,440
And he scares you to death
so he can take all your money.

127
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
It's true.

128
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,200
If he comes after me

129
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,680
Staffanie will
scare him to death first.

130
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,200
Ghosts aren't real.

131
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Have you ever seen one?

132
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,000
Then how do you know
they don't exist?

133
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,240
Because...

134
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,880
I only believe what I can see.

135
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
For me?

136
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,800
It's for badass rock chicks only.

137
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,880
Look, Mom. I'm a badass.

138
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,880
Please don't indoctrinate her
into your groupie world.

139
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,160
What's a groupie?

140
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,856
Your mom's favorite nickname for me,

141
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,440
even though she knows
I'm a guitar technician.

142
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
If you say so.

143
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,640
Hey, be nice or you don't get a gift.

144
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,280
Speaking of which,
check out what I got your dad.

145
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
What's going on, El?

146
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,680
Danny, go take my car
and get pizza with your sisters.

147
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,640
Sure thing, Mom.

148
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,680
I just can't wrap my head
around all this.

149
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,880
What, did he meet someone else?

150
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,440
No. He believes paying child support
equals co-parenting from afar.

151
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,360
Why didn't you tell me, El?

152
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,560
I would've jumped right on a plane
to help you work through this.

153
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,120
I called you.

154
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Twice.

155
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,816
First time, when he told me
he was leaving.

156
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,320
Second, the night he moved out.

157
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,160
That was
two and half months ago, Beth.

158
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry, okay?

159
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,216
You know when I'm on the road,
I get sucked in deep

160
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,816
and I'm trying to make
chief tech right now.

161
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,760
And if I do, I'll be the first woman
in my crew to do it, so...

162
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,120
Please, Ellie, we need
to talk this through properly.

163
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
El...

164
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,240
Look, you can sleep
on the sofa tonight

165
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
but I gotta pack and move.

166
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,480
<i>Hey, Bethy-boo.</i>

167
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,160
<i>It's Ellie. Just...</i>

168
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,480
<i>calling to say hi. And...</i>

169
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,080
<i>me and Jay, we...</i>

170
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,160
<i>You know what...</i>

171
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,360
I don't blame you.

172
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,920
I hate the sound of my voice too.

173
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,200
What's going on with you, Beth?

174
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,360
I screwed up again, like I always do.

175
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,400
And I need you
to help me figure it out.

176
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Again.

177
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
What happened?

178
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,200
Hurry up, Bridge.

179
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,400
You wanna carry them?

180
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,560
You wanna get your license?

181
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,200
Come on, Kass.

182
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,320
Earthquake!

183
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Come on.

184
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Go!

185
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Go!

186
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
Stay down!

187
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Shit.

188
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,120
That was intense.

189
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,200
I think I peed my pants.

190
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,680
Is it warm?

191
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,920
It's probably just soda.

192
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,160
All right. Come on.

193
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,280
Holy shit. Bridget, check this out.

194
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
What is it?

195
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
There's a hole.

196
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Careful, Dan.
There could be aftershocks.

197
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,200
It's an old bank vault!

198
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,160
Danny, don't!

199
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
Dan?

200
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,040
Come on, Danny. Let's go!

201
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Just hang on!

202
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Danny!

203
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,080
Relax a minute, Bridge!

204
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,840
Danny, are you okay?

205
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,040
I'm fine.

206
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Anything?

207
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
The network is totally screwed.

208
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm sure they're fine, El.

209
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Hey.

210
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,160
Is everyone okay? Anybody hurt?

211
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,600
Hey, Gabe.
The kids went to go get pizza

212
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,856
and I can't get through
on their cells.

213
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,360
Can I borrow your car
to go find them?

214
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,040
- How about I drive you?
- Thanks.

215
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,160
Let me get the keys.

216
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
Who are you?

217
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,040
Beth.

218
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Ellie's sister.

219
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,240
Ah, yeah, yeah.

220
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
The groupie.

221
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Let me ask you somethin'.

222
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,120
Can you hear her up there?

223
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
What?

224
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Quake.

225
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,440
Sent her hiding in the ducts.

226
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Here, kitty... kitty.

227
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Let's roll.

228
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
Is that them?

229
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
Good to meet you.

230
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,800
You never take the elevator
after a quake.

231
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,560
Bridget dropped the pizza.

232
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,800
Oh, honey. I love you guys
so much more than pizza.

233
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,600
<i>The magnitude 5.5 earthquake</i>

234
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
<i>hit just north
of the Puente Hills fault</i>

235
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,600
<i>less than an hour ago</i>

236
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,040
<i>jolting downtown Los Angeles
and everywhere from La Habra to...</i>

237
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,080
You think it might
be worth something?

238
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,800
Mom could do with some extra money
right now, don't you think?

239
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,440
I don't think Mom wants cash
from something you stole.

240
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,640
It's not stolen.

241
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,240
It's probably been locked
in that vault forever.

242
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,080
Yeah, and weird shit like this
gets locked away for a reason.

243
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,080
Just leave it, Dan.

244
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,360
Fuck!

245
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Let me see it.

246
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
It's just a nick.

247
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Dan...

248
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Danny, please close it.

249
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
I don't like this, Dan.

250
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,160
You need to put it back right now.

251
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,560
Mom's not letting any of us
out the front door again tonight.

252
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,240
First thing in the morning then.

253
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
Promise me?

254
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,120
You going deep sea diving?

255
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,840
I gotta see under before I get in.

256
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,200
I got stung by a jellyfish
at the beach before.

257
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,120
I don't like going underwater.

258
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,120
I don't think there's
any weird sea creatures in the tub.

259
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,560
Oh, my God... oh, my God.

260
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,560
It's a... It's a...

261
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,400
You okay?

262
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,760
I'm good, sweetie.

263
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,600
I hate when my tummy hurts too.

264
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,160
<i>Amen.</i>

265
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,800
<i>Good afternoon, my fellow clergymen.</i>

266
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,800
<i>I am Father Marcus Littleton</i>

268

to the City of Angels.</i>

269

<i>You've been invited here</i>

270
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,200

271
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,920
<i>that was discovered
by our overseas missionaries.</i>

272
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,480
<i>I would like to present</i>

273
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,560
<i>what I believe to be
one of the three fabled volumes</i>

274
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
<i>of</i> Naturum Demento

275

278

279

<i>This is heresy!</i>

280
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,600
<i>Today, I seek church approval</i>

281
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,600
<i>to translate the spiritual mysteries

282
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,800
<i>Destroy it!</i>

283
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,880
<i>It's called</i> The Book of the Dead

Help!

307
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Help!

308
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,400
Shut the fuck up!

309
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,000
It's okay. It's okay.

310
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,640
It's just a blackout.

311
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Bridget?

312
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You all right?

313
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Yeah.

314
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,000
Looks like it's just us that's out.

315
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Really?

316
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Mom?

317
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
El, are you sleeping?

318
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,920
Where is she?

319
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Mom?

320
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
El?

321
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,880
What's up, sis?

322
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,480
I had the most beautiful dream.

323
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,560
We were together,
sitting in a tall forest.

324
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,360
The wind was clean and the birds were
singing the sweetest mel... melo...

325
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
mel...

326
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,920
melo... me...

327
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,000
melodies.

328
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,800
It was a perfect day
and all I could think about

329
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,160
was how much I wanted
to cut you all open

330
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:21,000
and climb inside your bodies so that
we could stay one happy family.

331
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
It's in me.

332
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,920
Don't let it take my babies.

333
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Mom!

334
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,480
Bridget, take her back inside.

335
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Now!

336
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,480
What's wrong with her, Bridge?

337
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,120
Stairs. Go! Go, go, go.

338
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,240
Come on.

339
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,800
Wake up, Ellie. Come on, wake up.

340
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Danny!

341
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,480
They're gone.

342
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
One minute she was fine

343
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,360
and the next
she was talking crazy and...

344
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,200
and now she's gone.

345
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,000
Network's still fucked.

346
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,840
May I pray?

347
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,920
She's not religious.

348
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Wasn't.

349
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,480
It's just a few words.

350
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Join me.

351
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,880
Eternal rest grant
unto her, O Lord...

352
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,880
and let perpetual light
shine upon her.

353
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,360
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed

354
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,720
through the mercy of God...

355
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,200
What the hell happened to her face?

356
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,600
Rest in peace.

357
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,000
Looks like someone beat her up.

358
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,880
There's an old fire-escape ladder...

359
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,200
on the north side of the building.

360
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,400
I could try to get down that

361
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,720
raise the alarm,
get some help in here.

362
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,520
You have to go through 82.

363
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,640
Ah, shit.

364
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
That's unoccupied, right?

365
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,760
Yeah. Like most of
this condemned dump.

366
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,120
You got the tools?

367
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,760
We could just cut
right through the door.

368
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
In my truck.

369
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,336
You ain't gettin'
through those old doors

370
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,680
without something heavy-duty.

371
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,120
I want Dad to come home.

372
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
He will.

373
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,216
When we get the phones working again,
he'll come right back.

374
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,600
How do you know he will?

375
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,360
You said Mom was gonna be okay.

376
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,720
I thought she would be.

377
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
I'm so sorry, Kass.

378
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,136
I'm gonna get my shotgun,
and we're gonna blast it open.

379
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,520
Just give me a minute, okay?

380
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,960
I don't like being trapped.

381
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,000
Everyone is on edge enough
without guns getting fired in here.

382
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,720
I don't know what to do, El.

383
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,400
You're the one
who always has the answers.

384
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,440
I'm too scared
to even face your kids right now.

385
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,200
No matter how busy you ever got,
you always found time for me.

386
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
For everyone.

387
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,800
I can't believe I'm never gonna
speak to you again.

388
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,520
<i>Hey, Bethy-boo. It's Ellie.</i>

389
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
<i>Just...</i>

390
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,640
<i>calling to say hi. And...</i>

391
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,920
<i>Beth.</i>

392
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,120
<i>Beth!</i>

393
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,240
<i>You have to help me, Beth.
You have to.</i>

394
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,000
<i>I'm burning. I'm burning alive!</i>

395
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
El?

396
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,960
- Mom?
- She's alive?

397
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,160
She's burning up.

398
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,720
I'll get ice.

399
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Mom?

400
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,840
Mommy's with the maggots now.

401
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,880
Mom, stop it!

402
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
Stop it!

403
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,520
It's not my fault, Bridget.

404
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,200
Get away from her, Bridge!

405
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,040
What's happening to me, sweetheart?

406
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,800
I don't know, Mom.

407
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
I do.

408
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm free now.

409
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,640
Free from
all you titty-sucking parasites.

410
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,040
Let me kiss it better.

411
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,720
Who wants to rot next?

412
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Eeny...

413
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,640
meeny...

414
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,320
miny...

415
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,960
You.

416
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,360
Ellie?

417
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,080
Fuck!

418
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,840
Grab the cabinet.

419
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,920
Get away from the door.

420
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,760
Please, we need help!

421
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
Let me in!

422
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,840
Hello!

423
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,880
Can you hear me?

424
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,160
Don't you think Mom looks just like
one of those pictures from that book?

425
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,920
Answer me, Danny.

426
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,760
You never should've stolen it.

427
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,360
This isn't my fault.

428
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,840
This is your fault!

429
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,840
- Get off me!
- Stop it!

430
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:32,120
- Get off!
- Hey!

431
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,760
- This is all your fault!
- Hey, hey!

432
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,360
Hey. Hey.

433
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,720
You don't turn on each other.

434
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,040
Ever.

435
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,160
I need to show you something.

436
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,680
What is this, Danny?

437
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,880
Does it hurt bad?

438
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,960
Bridget?

439
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,360
I'm okay.

440
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,960
<i>Gold-haired girls</i>

441
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,360
<i>With curling tresses</i>

442
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,760
<i>Hush-a-bye, baby</i>

443
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,560
<i>Babe not mine</i>

444
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,040
<i>Mothers who nurse</i>

445
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,560
<i>With sad caresses</i>

446
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,000
<i>Hush-a-bye, baby</i>

447
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:32,160
<i>Babe not mine</i>

448
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,160
Mom?

449
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,920
Beth?

450
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,160
I took these too.

451
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,840
There's this creepy priest on them,
reading passages from the book.

452
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,680
It's like a weird dark prayer.

453
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,400
And when he spoke the words...

454
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,320
Bridget's right.

455
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,440
This is all my fault.

456
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,880
Bridget...

457
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Bridget...

458
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,120
<i>And black knife bring</i>

459
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,840
<i>To cross my sorrow</i>

460
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,240
<i>Hush-a-bye, baby</i>

461
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,200
<i>Babe not mine</i>

462
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,280
Oh, there you are.

463
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,640
Hey there, cutie-pie.

464
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,400
What's wrong with you, Mom?

465
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,920
I was just feeling sad
about me and your dad.

466
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,480
But he's here now.

467
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,160
He came home to see us.

468
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,000
We're getting back together.

469
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,200
We love each other.

470
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,720
Isn't that right, my darling?

471
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,040
And we love you too.

472
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,440
Open up and let us in, Kassie.

473
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,320
We can be a big, happy family again.

474
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,880
You don't look so good, Mom.

475
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,880
Oh.

476
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,280
Nothing a big old hug and kiss
from you won't fix.

477
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,760
Open up now

478
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,840
like a good girl.

479
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,800
That's it.

480
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,000
Come on, now.

481
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,880
Do it for Mom and Dad.

482
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,520
Mom!

483
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,080
- You okay?
- I'm sorry.

484
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,280
I thought Mom was better.

485
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,800
Open the door like you open your legs

486
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,280
you stinking groupie slut!

487
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,920
I'm not a groupie, you psycho bitch!

488
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,160
Beth.

489
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Beth.

490
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,160
Go to your room.

491
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,000
It'll be okay, Danny.

492
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,320
Staffanie will protect us. Right?

493
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,200
Yeah.

494
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,680
What are you looking at, hon?

495
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,520
I gotta kill the creepy-crawlies
that I got inside my tummy.

496
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,520
I don't like having things
inside my tummy.

497
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,400
Do you, Auntie Beth?

498
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,640
Hey.

499
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,880
Is this a nightmare?

500
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,400
It's just like a nightmare, Kass.

501
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,600
Is what happened to Bridget and Mom
gonna happen to us?

502
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,320
I'm not gonna let that happen.

503
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,360
I promise.

504
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,680
You'd be a good mom someday,
Auntie Beth.

505
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,360
Oh, yeah?

506
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,040
Yeah.

507
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,320
You know how to lie to kids.

508
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,360
I thought I should tie her up.

509
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,480
Just in case.

510
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,000
I wanna listen to that vinyl.

511
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,840
It's too dangerous.

512
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,280
- Those words...
- Yeah, well, maybe there's words

513
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,800
on there that can help
stop all of this.

514
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,240
We've got no power
to run a turntable.

515
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,680
I can fix that.

516
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,200
I listened to the first and then
he spoke the words on the second.

517
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,080
I guess I'll start
at the other end then.

518
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,640
Just in case.

519
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,400
<i>It is now two nights
since I read aloud from the book.</i>

520
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,280
<i>My want to understand
and commune with the other side</i>

521
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,200
<i>could not have been more misguided.</i>

522
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,800
<i>I make this final recording
as a warning to whoever next</i>

523
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,320
<i>comes into contact
with its malignant pages.</i>

524
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,560
Naturum Demento <i>cannot be destroyed.</i>

525
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,360
<i>When you find it,
bury it deep in our secret vault</i>

526
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,200
<i>for the words I uttered
have unleashed a demonic entity</i>

527
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,360
<i>beyond my darkest nightmare.</i>

528
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,000
Is Bridget gonna come back like Mom?

529
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,280
I don't know, Kass.

530
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,840
<i>The demon possessed Cortez first,
rotting him from the inside out.</i>

531
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,440
<i>With the might of our Lord's words</i>

532
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,720
<i>we tried to drive out the foul entity</i>

533
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,680
<i>but it mocked our prayers
and took Shanahan under its control.</i>

534
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,640
<i>Fellow priests came to our aid</i>

535
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,760
<i>but the possession
quickly spread amongst them</i>

536
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,760
<i>without rhyme nor reason.</i>

537
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,800
<i>This evil is not governed
by the rules of man.</i>

538
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:54,920
<i>No, it takes its pleasure in creating
terror through total chaos.</i>

539
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,800
<i>Desperate to end this curse</i>

540
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,000
<i>I tried to kill
what were once my brothers.</i>

541
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:08,600
<i>I led them to the woodshed
and set it ablaze.</i>

542
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,560
<i>But they danced in its flame
and reveled in its burn.</i>

543
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,080
Mr. Fonda's kitty
hides up there sometimes.

544
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,200
I don't think it's a cat.

545
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,040
<i>I buried their squirming</i>

546
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,480
<i>spitting corpses
in consecrated earth.</i>

547
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,000
<i>But they arose again</i>

548
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,000
<i>rotting and rage-filled.</i>

549
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,560
Careful, Danny.

550
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,760
<i>After hiding in the cellar
for a night</i>

551
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,600
<i>I knew only one choice remained.</i>

552
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:56,760
<i>Complete bodily dismemberment.</i>

553
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:18,640
Told you, you should've
put the book back, Danny.

554
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,920
<i>I chopped, and I hacked</i>

555
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,360
<i>and I...</i>

556
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,520
<i>I failed.</i>

557
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,640
<i>I can hear them outside the doors
now, begging for me.</i>

558
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,640
<i>It is only a matter of time
before I am taken too.</i>

559
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,800
<i>Nothing can stop this demonic force.</i>

560
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,120
<i>Even its final remnants
will come after you.</i>

561
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,320
<i>You must run.</i>

562
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,840
<i>All you can do...</i>

563
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,320
Is run!

564
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:17,920
<i>This horror will not stop
until innocence is destroyed.</i>

565
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,560
<i>Until evil...</i>

566
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,520
<i>be thy name.</i>

567
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,360
Danny...

568
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,680
I'm sorry, Kass.

569
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,600
I will swallow your soul.

570
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,320
Two souls?

571
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:27,880
Please. El...

572
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:31,520
Ellie waits in hell for you
and your unborn bastard baby.

573
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,320
No.

574
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,360
Auntie Beth!

575
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,880
Are you hurt?

576
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,680
Are you gonna be a mom?

577
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,280
Yes.

578
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,360
And I'm getting us out of here.

579
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,680
How?

580
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,080
Fire escape. Let's go.

581
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,520
Don't look back there.

582
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,400
Get back. Cover your ears.

583
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,240
Bethy-boo!

584
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,320
She's trying to take your mommy
away from you, Kassie.

585
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,200
I know you're not my mom anymore.

586
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,560
Don't take me from them.

587
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,640
You have no idea what it's like

588
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,880
to bring a child into
this world, Beth.

589
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,560
That's my gun, you thieving cunt.

590
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,840
Auntie Beth!

591
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:14,840
Auntie Beth!

592
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,800
Everybody here dies by dawn, Beth.

593
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:41,320
Run!

594
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,800
Dead by dawn!

595
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,040
Dead by dawn!

596
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,720
Dead by dawn!

597
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,680
Dead by dawn!

598
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,000
Dead by dawn!

599
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,200
Dead by dawn!

600
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,240
Dead by dawn!

601
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,920
Dead by dawn!

602
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,720
Dead by dawn!

603
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,560
Dead by dawn!

604
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,360
Here.

605
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,360
No way out!

606
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,040
No way out!

607
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,600
No way out!

608
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,000
- Auntie Beth!
- Come here!

609
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,880
Kassie. Kassie.

610
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:53,920
Kassie. Kassie. Kassie.

611
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,600
Am I dead?

612
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,520
Come on. Get in.

613
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,000
Kass, where's the beeper?

614
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,040
Come on. Come on.

615
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,200
It's coming.

616
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,200
Get under!

617
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,280
Kassie!

618
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,760
All I want is
your little head, baby girl.

619
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,520
Come get some.

620
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,400
Turn it on, Kass!

621
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,800
Please.

622
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,320
Help me, Bethy-boo.

623
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,200
Only my sister gets to call me that.

624
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,080
You know,
you really do look like Mom.

625
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,760
And you're gonna
fail miserably just like her.

626
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,000
You stinking, horrible groupie cunt!

627
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,800
There's been no cell signal
until, like, five minutes ago

628
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:59,600
and the thunder kept me awake, so
I got basically less than zero sleep.

629
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,080
Anyway, all my early morning
moans aside

630
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,120
we are still gonna have
such a fab weekend at the lake.

631
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,520
Caleb's dad's cabin is so awesome

632
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,040
and you're gonna absolutely
love his friends.

633
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,920
I'm sure one of them
will be perfect for you.

634
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,960
<i>I don't mean to be
a downer or anything</i>

635
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,280
<i>but I was actually thinking</i>

636
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,360
<i>of taking a rain check
on this whole trip thing.</i>

637
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,840
Not a chance.
I'm picking you up in 15.

638
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:23,920
Bye!
