- Just one box?
- It's for my office. It's fragile.

00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,103
Sissy.

- Hey, dude, headphones.

00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,276
You're gonna go deaf!

7
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,433
An autograph?

8
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,314
- I just thought that...
- Are you kidding me?

9
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,366
Ma'am?

10
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,616
- Sheriff.
- Your husband around?

Honey.

14
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,497
Sweetheart.

15
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,338
- What are you doing?
- Painting.

16
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,003
Yeah. I know. I think your mom
wants your help unpacking.

17
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,297
I know.

18
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,849
So come outside.
You can finish your painting later.

19
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,886
I didn't wanna move here.
I shouldn't have to carry boxes.

20
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:43,228
We had to move here
and we all have to help carry boxes.

21
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,769
- Uh-uh. You wanted to move here.
- No, I had to move here.

22
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,233
The new story I'm writing is here.

23
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,524
Why can't you just keep writing
in the old house?

24
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,365
'Cause I was gonna have to write college
textbooks to pay for that old house.

25
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,121
- And I can't do that.
- Why not?

26
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,625
- 'Cause I just can't.
- But I miss my school.

27
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,003
Well, you know what? The school here
is supposed to be pretty great.

28
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,130
But I want my old one.

29
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,420
I know. How about this, all right?
I'll tell you what.

30
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,132
If we don't like it here,
once I sell my book, we'll move back.

31
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:19,802
But only if we don't like it here.

32
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,016
- Really?
- Really.

33
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,271
You promise?

34
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,400
I promise. But you have to promise
to try to like it here.

35
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,481
- I promise.
- You do? Now, my little artist.

36
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,442
- What's the number one rule?
- Paint only goes in the bedroom.

37
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,733
- Where doesn't it go?
- Anywhere else in the house.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,819
Right. Okay, now, come with me.
Move some boxes.

39
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,948
Sheriff's here.

40
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,085
- Already?
- Play nice this time.

41
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,745
- I'm always nice.
- I'm not kidding.

42
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,132
I'm tired of driving five miles under
the speed limit to get ticketed anyway.

43
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,634
Be nice.

44
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,055
Afternoon. Is there a problem?

45
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,262
No, sir. Just a friendly visit.

46
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,347
I appreciate that. Ellison Oswalt.

47
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,138
I know who you are.

48
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,807
- So you're not a fan.
- No.

49
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,476
Well, what can I do for you?

50
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,692
Well, not much, I expect,
unless I can convince you

51
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,280
to load those boxes back on that truck
and leave as soon as you're able.

52
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,365
No, I don't think so,
but, you know what.

53
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,826
I do have a couple of extra copies
of Kentucky Blood

54
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,366
if you want me to get one out
and sign it for you.

55
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,582
- No, thank you, sir.
- Is it the writing?

56
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:32,420
More a matter of content. You don't seem
to care much for our profession.

57
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,960
Not everybody in your profession
gets it right.

58
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,595
I've read your books. Neither do you.

59
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,971
- Look...
- You got it right in Kentucky Blood.

60
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,307
I'll give you that.
It's a fine piece of writing.

61
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,349
But Cold Denver Morning,
you got it wrong.

62
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,893
- Blood Diner...
- Look, that wasn't my fault. All right?

63
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,732
Your bad theory helped a killer go free.
You ruined people's lives.

64
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,777
Now, this town doesn't need that.
It needs to heal. It needs to forget.

65
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,492
We sure don't want that circus
that you bring with you.

66
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,531
Well, there's a missing girl
involved here.

67
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,669
- She ain't missing. She's dead.
- Come on. You don't know that.

68
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,372
If that girl is still alive,
then it ain't no miracle

69
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,006
and we ain't ever gonna find her.

70
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,542
Then I guess
we should just let it go, huh?

71
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,054
You don't think the town
deserves an explanation?

72
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,592
Something like this... You can
never explain something like this.

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,772
And if you were able to, the odds are
you wouldn't much care for the answer.

74
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,228
Now, we did our job. You'll see that.

75
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,988
And this is just another waste
of your time like your last two books.

76
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,566
If writing true crime
has taught me one thing.

77
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,203
It's that whenever an officer of the law
tells me that I'm wasting my time,

78
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,784
it just means
he thinks he's wasting his.

79
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,826
That's clever.
You ought to write that down.

80
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,586
Well, I'm gonna go out on a limb

81
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,123
and assume your department
is not at my disposal?

82
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,886
Well, what do you know? You can still
get things right on occasion.

83
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,980
Oh, and... I find this to be
in extremely bad taste.

84
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,866
- What was all that about?
- The usual.

85
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,323
He wanted an autograph,
but he left his copy at home.

86
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,204
- He'll be back later.
- That bad?

87
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,786
- Mm-hm.
- Why was he pointing at the house?

88
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,959
Ellison, we didn't move in a few houses
down from a crime scene again, did we?

89
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,631
- Tracy...
- No, just don't say anything.

90
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,884
If we did, I don't wanna know about it.

91
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,550
- We didn't.
- You promise?

92
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,259
I promise.

93
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,848
Here. Make yourself useful, Kitchen.

94
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,231
It's gonna be good here, OK?
You'll see.

Enjoy, kids. We're not likely
to be able to eat out much this time.

- Oh!
- Why not?

105
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,082
- You know why.
- I don't.

106
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,750
We haven't sold the old house yet.

107
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,636
Once it's gone, well be able to afford
a few extra things.

108
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,093
Then sell it already.
Lower the price if you have to.

109
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,553
We've already lowered it
as much as we can.

110
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,061
The market's terrible. Once we're not
paying two mortgages, we'll be fine.

111
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,939
And once I sell my new book,
we'll be on Easy Street.

- Yeah, it's good. Of course it is.

00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,611
- Will you show me where it happened?
- Trevor.

114
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,443
I'm old enough to know about this stuff.

115
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,279
No, youre not. Even I'm not old enough
to know about this stuff.

116
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,115
Your father writes
about terrible, terrible things.

117
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,746
- I shouldn't be writing about it?
- That's not what I meant.

118
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,578
That's the way you said it.

119
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,663
I'm gonna hear about it
at school anyway.

120
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,420
Kids'll all hate me again
and tell me nonstop what happened.

121
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,502
- Hey, nobody hates you.
- I might as well hear it from you.

122
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,088
- Are you listening to this?
- Yes. I'm listening.

123
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,345
Let's at least make sure
your office stays locked.

124
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,551
It's one thing to hear about it,
another to see it.

125
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,465
I don't want him walking in again.
He's 12.

126
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,427
- Mom, he knows how old I am.
- Hey, stop it.

- <font color="#808080">ALL:</font>  Never go in Dad's office.

129
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,980
- Always lock Dad's office.
- That's right.

130
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,238
And I don't wanna hear another thing
about why we're here, from anybody.

Yeah.

132
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,574
You didn't brush your teeth.

133
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,789
- No. not yet.
- You're not coming to bed?

134
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:04,877
No, I thought I'd set up my office first
and get started.

135
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,212
- How long is it gonna be?
- Just an hour or two.

136
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,970
No, I mean...
how long are we here for this time?

137
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,804
Oh, God' I don't know.
It could be along one.

138
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,014
I liked it better
when you were writing fiction.

- Maybe you should try again.

141
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,020
I can't do this without you by my side.

142

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm on your side.

I just wanna see you
enjoying your work again.

144

When you're happy... we're all happy.

145
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,952
I just need another hit, that's all.

146
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,164
- Just one more.
- I just...

147
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,252
What?

148
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,508
- You know I'm behind you on this.
- I know.

149
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:52,591
But that's not what you were gonna say.
What were you gonna say?

Really, I'm fine.

313
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:33,362
I'd prefer to take you down to

- Okay.

00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:50,637
- This way.
- So... let's go see this hole.

319
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,060
So you say you heard a loud thump
and footsteps in the attic

320
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,390
after the power went out?

321
00:43:58,553 --> 00:43:59,600
Yes.

322
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,017
- But the ladder wasn't down?
- No, it wasn't.

323
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,733
It's not possible to close it
from inside the attic?

324
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,738
No.

325
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,899
So how would an intruder get up there?

326
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,411
I didn't say anyone was up there. I said
it sounded like there was an intruder.

327
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,574
- I did see a small snake, though.
- Snakes don't have feet.

328
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,625
You know, I'm...
I'm guessing that you got squirrels.

329
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,381
With, you know, way in and out up there

330
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,009
and all the power gone off
in the neighbourhood.

331
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:34,674
I bet they got spooked from the sound
of everything shutting down at once.

332
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,841
- You know how they are.
- Not really.

333
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,807
- I'm not really a squirrel guy.
- Really?

334
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:43,143
I did kill a scorpion
when we first moved in here. though,

335
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,979
so maybe I should get an exterminator.

336
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:49,362
Scorpions have feet. but you wouldn't
hear 'em like you would squirrels.

337
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,403
Well, Officer, thank you very much.

338
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:57,116
It's... I will... If there's
anything else I can do for you...

339
00:44:57,278 --> 00:45:00,999
Actually, there is. I left my copy
of Kentucky Blood down at the station.

340
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,125
It'd really mean a lot to me
if you signed a copy.

341
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:07,380
- I got a few extra copies in my office.
- Thank you so much. That's so great.

342
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,468
Wow. Do you know what? This is like
one of them FBI profiler's offices.

343
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,722
You got a map with pictures
connected with yarn and everything.

344
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,760
Deputy. I need you to step outside.
This is my private office. I'm serious.

345
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:21,724
- Just wait outside.
- Mr. Oswalt. listen.

346
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,765
You know there's a page in your books

347
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,276
where you always say nice things about
all the people that helped you out?

348
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,778
- The acknowledgements?
- Yeah. well...

349
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,737
Yeah, and in each one there's always
like a line that says, you know.

350
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,402
"I couldn't have done this
without the tireless efforts

351
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,493
of Deputy So And So
from the local police department."

352
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,078
Right.

353
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:46,461
Well, you know, I could be like...

354
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:50,749
you know, your Deputy So And So,
you know, if you don't already have one.

355
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,464
Yeah, there are a few things
you could do for me, actually.

356
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:55,299
- Really?
- Yeah. this could be perfect.

357
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,555
- Do you have a notepad?
- Um...

358
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,394
- Yes.
- All right. Do you need a pen?

359
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,354
Yes.

360
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,267
I need the street address of a crime.

361
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,856
In 1998, St Louis,
a family was stabbed to death.

362
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,488
They had their throats out.
It was a pretty ugly affair.

363
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,571
I also need any details you can get me
on another murder,

364
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,111
1979, a family was burned alive,

365
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,656
parked inside their own car,
in their own garage.

366
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,620
- What city?
- I don't know.

367
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,501
All I have is the year
and the method of execution.

368
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,880
Hmm. You think
that the two cases are related?

369
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:36,340
- Oh, no, no. I'm just doing research.
- Okay. I can definitely get this for you.

370
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:40,177
I gotta wait till the sheriff
leaves the office, but I will get it.

371
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,341
Thank you very much, Deputy So And So.

372
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,394
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

373
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,060
I was angry at Trevor today
and I took it out on you.

374
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,570
No, don't be sorry.
I know the move's been hard for you.

375
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:58,450
- I'm trying, Ell. I really am.
- I know.

376
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,905
I just want you here with me,
that's all.

377
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:05,164
I've always been with you.
And I'm with you now.

378
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,134
Pleased to have Ellison Oswalt
on our programme.

379
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,090
His new book is called Kentucky Blood.

380
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,880
- Good to have you on.
- Thanks for having me. A real pleasure.

381
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,800
<font color="#808080">HOST:</font> Man, I got into this.
This is pretty graphic stuff.

382
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,219
So let me star? by asking
why you spend so much time

383
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,934
investigating such grisly content?

384
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:32,145
Fame and money?
No, I'm just kidding.

385
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:36,734
The honest answer is that I'm really
driven by a sense of injustice.

386
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,690
When I think about the awful things
that happened to these people

387
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:43,407
and that those responsible were never
even identified, let alone caught...

388
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,822
I mean, I knew
when I started this particular case

389
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,992
that I might stumble on a few things
that maybe somebody'd overlooked.

390
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:52,287
<font color="#808080">HOST:</font> Might? No, you in fact did
uncover some additional information

391
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,922
that the cops had overlooked.

392
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:58,585
Well, look, first off, there are
a lot of good police officers out there

393
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,220
and I don't wanna in any way
disparage what they do, right?

394
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:05,100
But in police work getting something
wrong means ruining people's lives.

395
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:07,225
Good crime writing can set things right.

396
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,059
So, ultimately, what feels better?

397
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:14,351
Seeing justice done
or seeing your book, Kentucky Blood,

398
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,020
number one
on the New York Times bestseller list?

399
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,899
The justice, without question.

400
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:25,741
I'd rather cut my hands off
than write a book for fame or money.

- Yeah, I understand.
- But I got what you asked about.

413

There was a Martinez family
in Sacramento, California,

414
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,412
that died in their garage in 1979,
their car was set on fire.

415
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,869
One of their sons, nine years old,
they never found him.

416
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:03,209
- Do you have the street address?
- It's 8224 Billington, Sacramento.

417
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,462
And what about St Louis?

418
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:07,375
The address of the house
where the Miller murders occurred is

419
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,385
2976 Piedmont Way, St Louis.

420
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:15,220
That is excellent. 29...
Wait, did you say 2976, like 29-76?

421
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,009
Yeah. Does that mean something to you?

422
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,055
No, no, it doesn't. No.
Thank you. Thank you. Deputy.

to still be having these.

444
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,249
He was supposed
to have outgrown them by now.

445
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:42,793
- He's all right. He's Okay.
- Just stop.

446
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,425
- Stop what?
- Drop the book.

447
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,141
We can pack up, get out of town
and never look back.

448
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,177
Why, 'cause he's having
some night terrors?

449
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:54,267
It's more than that.
He's never been this bad.

450
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,852
- You've never been this bad.
- What are you talking about?

451
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:59,768
You've been at this book less than
a week and you're already a mess.

452
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,358
You never crack into the whisky
this early and this often.

453
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,239
- You're saying I'm a drunk?
- No.

454
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,742
I'm saying there's something
you aren't telling me,

455
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,279
something that's eating you up, and it
seems to be getting to Trevor as well.

456
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,324
- Somethings different this time.
- Yeah, you wanna know what it is?

457
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,164
- How much do you wanna know?
- I wanna know why you're different.

458
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,705
I'm different because I've never
been onto something this big before.

459
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:22,169
Do you remember how it was
when I was writing Kentucky?

460
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,211
- I remember.
- This is much bigger than that! Much!

461
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:28,221
I am talking about
a potentially important work here.

462
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,805
I'm talking about a mega hit.
This could be my In Cold Blood.

463
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:36,689
A movie deal, talk show circuit, right?
A national book award.

464
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,600
More money than we could...
We could live wherever we wanted to.

465
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,144
- I don't care about any of that.
- You do. Everybody does.

466
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,688
- I'm just...
- This is my shot, Tracy.

467
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,401
You're just what?

468
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:54,245
- I'm just worried about you.
- Well, don't be. Nothing is wrong.

469
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:57,000
Then why did you come in
white as a ghost?

470
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,962
Because I saw a dog, Okay?

471
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,921
- A dog?
- A very big dog, like Cujo big.

472
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,257
I mean, I'd never seen him before.
He's like...

473
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,422
- Did you get rid of him?
- Yeah, he's gone.

474
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,217
Listen, I just need
a little more time. Okay?

475
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,681
I promise it's worth it.

476
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,815
Every minute that we're here, we're
a minute closer to that happy ending

477
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,520
that we always dreamed of.

478
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,731
We're almost there.

479
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,156
Okay?

480
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:34,113
- Deputy.
- Mr. Oswalt, these came in this morning.

481
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:37,624
I had a few of the pertinent files
pulled for you and had 'em faxed over.

482
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,126
- Really?
- Yeah.

483
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,378
- Thanks.
- No problem.

484
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,373
Do you think I could come in
for a second?

485
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,509
Uh... Yeah. sure.

486
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,510
- Thanks.
- Come on, just here.

487
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,138
Look, I...
I know what you must think of me.

488
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:56,598
Some small-town deputy that's starstruck
with the famous writer.

489
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,017
- But I'm not some local moron.
- I didn't say you were a... you know.

490
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:03,684
I have a degree in criminology.

491
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:08,151
I've taken my fair share
of forensic science courses.

492
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:13,570
I also know a series of connected
murders when I see one, Mr Oswalt.

493
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,454
- Look...
- We missed something. I get that.

494
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,787
But if you want me to run interference
for you while you get this worked out.

495
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,830
I gotta be in the loop
just a little bit.

496
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:29,380
- You really wanna help?
- It's my home, Mr Oswalt.

497
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,171
What happened here
happened to all of us.

498
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,260
All right. Come here.

499
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,401
Who is that?

500
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,689
I don't know.
That's what I'm hoping to find out.

501
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,277
- You think these are serial murders?
- Maybe.

502
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,913
More ritualized than necessarily serial.
But really spread out.

503
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,794
And not just regionally but over time.
The first one dates back to the '60s.

504
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:07,001
- The 1960s?
- Yeah.

505
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,508
That would put the guy,
what, in his 70s?

506
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,215
- Yeah. or his 60s.
- Yeah, I...

507
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:15,221
- I don't know.
- Well, look at the methodology.

508
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,884
Toxicology reports. some cases
the killer drugged his victims.

509
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:22,805
- With what?
- Well, they couldn't tell for sure.

510
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,192
But by drugging them, the killer
removes his need to overpower them.

511
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:29,603
Here he used a tree branch
to do the heavy lifting.

512
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:33,273
In Sacramento he lit a family on fire.
In St Louis he slit their throats.

513
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,444
- The first family he drowned.
- Drowning? You...

514
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,079
You never said anything
about anyone being drowned.

515
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,706
The only other significant link
between the murder cases

516
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:46,086
is that in each instance the killer
murdered the entire family except one.

517
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,246
A child which he took with him.

518
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:54,011
That and this symbol appears
in several of the crime scenes.

519
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:57,264
That looks like something
from out of the occult.

520
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,892
Look' you might wanna
call the university.

521
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,349
There's a professor over there.
Professor Jonas.

522
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:04,763
He's an occult crime expert

523
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:08,651
and the state police bring him in
on some of the... the weirder stuff.

524
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:10,731
I think this qualifies.

525
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,989
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font> So where do you think
that drowning happened?

526
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,525
That's what I need you to find out.

527
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,156
Okay.

528
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,927
<font color="#D900D9">(RINGING)</font>

529
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,130
- Professor Jonas?
- Yes.

530
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,801
Hello. Hey, thank you for getting back
to me so quickly. I appreciate that.

531
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,767
Of course, I'm a really big fan.
I'm flattered that you emailed.

532
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,477
Once I saw the photos that you sent,

533
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,314
I knew exactly
what cases you were studying.

534
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:59,067
Wait. How would you know
what cases I was looking at?

535
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:03,951
The symbol that you sent me is...
isn't a pentagram.

536
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:06,111
It's not something
that you would see teenagers

537
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:10,703
or a Norwegian black metal band paint
on a wall in goat's blood to be edgy.

538
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,538
- Right.
- Or to piss off the Christians..

539
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,579
No, this is a little bit more obscure
than that.

540
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,545
I know the one in the hallway,

541
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:23,462
that's from the late '90s in St Louis.

542
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,264
The other one, the... the car hood,

543
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,097
that is from Sacramento,
that's about 30 years ago.

544
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,011
Tell me about the one in Sacramento.

545
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:35,478
It's a symbol associated
with the worship of a pagan deity.

546
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,358
A deity? What kind of deity?

547
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,613
A very obscure one,
dating back to Babylonian times.

548
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:45,321
Named Bughuul, the eater of children.

549
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:50,956
- Did you say eater?
- Yes, of children. Thank you, Jessica.

550
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,787
The crimes that you're dealing with.

551
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,372
They all have the element
of a missing child, correct?

552
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,038
Yes. Yeah. That's correct.

553
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,333
Well, Bughuul eats children.

554
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,127
Now, the fragments of stories
that have survived,

555
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:09,683
they all revolve around him needing
the souls of human children to survive.

556
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,937
Now, each story involves a different way

557
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:19,317
that he lures or tricks these children
away from the physical world

558
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,650
and traps them in his own netherworld

559
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,861
and he consumes their souls over time.

560
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:30,746
Now, any worship of this deity
would include a blood sacrifice

561
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,578
or the wholesale eating of a child.

562
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,462
So you're saying the person that made
this symbol is... is eating children?

563
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,588
Well, that would fit the stories.

564
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:44,377
Of course, the few times
that this symbol has shown up,

565
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,842
none of the crimes have been related
in any way to any of this.

566
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:51,224
So this might be
more of a cult initiation

567
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:55,478
rather than, you know,
the actual actions of any one man.

568
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,601
There's been another one, hasn't there?

569
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,866
I think so, yes.

570
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,026
Tell me everything you can.

578
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:03,388
- I appreciate you coming by, Officer.
- Oh, yeah, it's not a problem at all.

579
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:08,598
- So we're becoming friends. right?
- I... I suppose, yeah.

- Yeah, absolutely.

581
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,857
So if I were to ask you
something in earnest.

582
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,644
You wouldn't read too much into it?

583
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,063
Um... All right.

584
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:28,702
Was there anything... weird
about the Stevensons?

585
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:35,003
No complaints from them
about anything... strange?

586
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,540
No, not to my knowledge.

587
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,676
The investigators. did they notice
anything odd or inexplicable

588
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:45,259
about the house, any...
any weird stories?

589
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,048
No.

590
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,351
Mr. Oswalt. is there something
that you wanna tell me?

591
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:59,228
Clearly something happened and you wanna
talk to somebody about it, right?

592
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:00,940
Yeah.

593
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,323
Okay, well, does your wife
know about it?

594
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,576
Wait.

595
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:12,783
Does she know
whose house this is... was?

596
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,753
<font color="#D900D9">(LAUGHS)</font>

597
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:22,884
Oh, man. Oh, that is a conversation
that I would not wanna be around for.

598
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,589
- No, me neither.
- I'm sorry.

599
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:30,259
So... So, what, you saw something weird,
heard something spooky in the house?

600
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,354
- Yes. Precisely.
- What exactly?

601
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:38,983
Now...

602
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:44,610
I don't believe in any, you know, stuff.

603
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:48,902
Stuff? You mean the supernatural,
the metaphysical, the paranormal.

604
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,196
- That type of stuff?
- Right.

605
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:52,955
Right. Of course you don't.

606
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,458
You never would have moved
into a crime scene if you did.

607
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,836
But here we are
having this conversation.

608
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:01,965
Yeah, but... but there was...

609
01:15:02,123 --> 01:15:07,880
there was none of that, you know,
none of that with the Stevensons, huh?

610
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,925
No. In the short amount of time
that the Stevensons lived here,

611
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:15,015
they never called the police,
they never had the police called on them

612
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,647
or reported anything bizarre
that came up in the investigation.

613
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:21,730
- Do you wanna know what I think?
- Yes.

614
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,571
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font>

615
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:29,075
I think that you moved yourself
into the house of murder victims

616
01:15:29,233 --> 01:15:32,203
and immediately set about trying
to put yourself in their head space.

617
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,991
I also think that you've begun
discovering things about this case

618
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:40,003
that go to darker places
than you were prepared for.

619
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,789
I also think that every time
that I've been to your house.

620
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,504
There's a whisky bottle
that doesn't appear to be neglected.

621
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,296
- No, no, no. I...
- Mr Oswalt. listen. I don't. I don't...

622
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,932
I'm not saying that you have
a drinking problem. I don't think that.

623
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,764
Nor do I think
that you're making any of this up...

624
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,724
- No!
- ...to get attention.

625
01:15:57,887 --> 01:16:01,357
What I do think is that...
that you are under so much stress.

626
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,483
You've put yourself
under so much stress.

627
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:07,863
That your mind
is trying to process all of it at once.

628
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:13,321
So you don't believe
any of that otherworldly stuff, right?

629
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:16,956
Are you kidding me?
I believe in all that stuff.

630
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,163
I... I wouldn't sleep one night
in this place. Are you nuts?

631
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,296
Four people were hung by their necks
in the tree in your backyard

632
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,378
and that little girl
is probably God knows wherever.

633
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:30,295
- Okay.
- I'm... I'm sorry. You know what?

634
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:34,557
You should try and get out more,
Mr Oswalt, try to clear your head.

635
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:39,103
Total honesty?

636
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:47,396
Last night
I thought something was in the house...

637
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:51,987
...and I woke up on the couch
holding a baseball bat.

638
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:58,326
Well... I guess if I thought
something was in my home at night.

639
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,207
I'd be a little bit freaked out too.

640
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:04,997
But, listen, Mr Oswalt,
if you sleep in this house.

641
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,836
It's just gonna do
terrible things to your head.

642
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,555
<font color="#808080">TRACY:</font> Ellison!

643
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:16,340
- Ellison!
- What's going on?

644
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:20,478
Your daughter thought there wasn't
room on her walls for her new painting.

645
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,388
- Ashley!
- No, that's not it.

646
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,683
What did we talk about?
We only gave you one rule.

647
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:27,227
It was a big deal for us
to let you paint on your walls.

648
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,067
- What's the rule, Ashley?
- Paint only goes in the bedroom.

649
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:32,231
And what makes you think
you can paint out here?

650
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:34,992
I wanted to paint her picture,
but she didn't want it in my room

651
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,495
because that used to be
her brother's room.

652
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,202
What? Who are you talking about?

653
01:17:40,364 --> 01:17:42,708
- Stephanie.
- Who's Stephanie?

654
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:47,418
She used to live here. She's the one
Daddy's writing his book about.

655
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,463
Ashley, go to your room
and shut the door.

656
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,937
What the hell were you thinking?
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

657
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:11,149
Shh. Of course I knew you were
gonna find out eventually, Okay?

658
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:14,282
But don't blame me for not telling you.
You never wanted to know.

659
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,908
Don't try and pin this on me.

660
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,694
I asked you! I asked you
if we were living near the house!

661
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:22,115
You asked me if we were living
two houses down from a crime scene.

662
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:23,908
- Don't you dare!
- I said no.

663
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,543
- We never should have come here!
- Tracy, nobody died here.

664
01:18:26,744 --> 01:18:29,042
It's not like were sleeping
where somebody was killed

665
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,674
or they had to wipe blood
off the walls for the open house.

666
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:35,336
- You're saying it didn't happen here?
- No. It happened in the backyard.

667
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:39,006
Oh, that is so sick!
God. you think that makes a difference?

668
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,471
- It does.
- No, Ellison. It doesn't.

669
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:43,682
You have done
some crazy shit in the past.

670
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:45,391
But this definitely takes the cake.

671
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,898
My God. what on earth
possessed you to move here?

672
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,480
- We've never been this broke before.
- That's no excuse.

673
01:18:50,684 --> 01:18:52,561
This place came on the market.
It was a steal.

674
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,402
Gee, I wonder why.

675
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,568
So what Trevor drew last week,
that happened here?

676
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,074
Yes.

677
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:05,788
The previous owners of this home
were hung from a tree in our backyard?

678
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:08,419
- Yes.
- That is so sick. Ellison.

679
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,921
And you let our little girl
play back there?

680
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,127
Why shouldn't I?

681
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:14,337
Our son is having night terrors

682
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,719
and drawing pictures
of this crime at school.

683
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,096
And our daughter just painted
a dead girl on our wall.

684
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:21,758
She's missing.
Technically she's missing.

685
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,302
I don't wanna hear about technicalities.

686
01:19:24,468 --> 01:19:26,061
Do you understand
what you've done,

687
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:29,269
the kind of jeopardy you've put
your children in, your marriage?

688
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,523
Yes, I do!

689
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:34,483
Is there anything you won't do
for your goddamn book?

690
01:19:37,356 --> 01:19:40,155
Apparently not.
I guess this is all worth it to you.

691
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,411
- It's worth it.
- Putting your family at risk.

692
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:45,573
- Risk of what? Of more paintings?
- Don't. Your daughter...

693
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:47,412
My daughter has a father who loves her,

694
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:50,453
who is always around,
who encourages her to be herself.

695
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,542
The worst thing
that has ever happened to her

696
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:55,458
is one time she moved into a house
where a family was killed.

697
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,719
She found out about the murders,
so she felt sorry for the little girl.

698
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,175
So she painted a fucking picture!

699
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:04,808
That's what she does.
It's what she always has done.

700
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,937
- That's it? That's all you have to say?
- What else do you want from me?

701
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:11,474
How about a home
where we feel safe, Ellison?

702
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,642
How about neighbours that don't hate us

703
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,609
in a town where I can buy groceries
without getting strange looks?

704
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,490
How about a life
that doesn't involve our kids

705
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:24,324
drawing and painting the sick details
of some horrific tragedy

706
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:27,122
or working out
their deep-seated anxieties

707
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:28,908
by doing bizarre shit in the night?

708
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:33,045
- How about that? Would that be Okay?
- I can give all that to you, I can!

709
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:36,798
- Just when I finish the book!
- This book isn't for us. It's for you.

710
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:38,880
Tracy, don't say that. That's not true.

711
01:20:39,043 --> 01:20:42,092
It is true. There are plenty of other
ways you can provide for this family.

712
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,015
Doing what? Teaching?

713
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,723
Editing journalism textbooks?

714
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:54,439
Don't you understand that writing
is what gives my life meaning?

715
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,820
These books are my legacy.

716
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:04,786
I have always supported you
doing what you love, Ellison.

717
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,696
But writing isn't the meaning
of your life.

718
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:13,336
You and me, right here, this marriage'
that's the meaning of your life.

719
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:17,256
And your legacy,
that's Ashley and Trevor.

720
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:20,133
Your kids are your legacy.

721
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:36,522
- Did I get Daddy in trouble?
- No, sweetie.

722
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:38,777
Your daddy got Daddy in trouble.

723
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:42,861
- I'm sorry I painted on the wall.
- I know.

724
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:45,117
You get a good night's sleep.

725
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:55,790
<font color="#808080">WOMAN:</font> <font color="#D900D9">(ON VIDEO)</font> So here's the book
I wrote proving it, right?

726
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:56,954
<font color="#808080">ELLISON:</font> Exactly.

727
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:01,092

728

<font color="#808080">ELLISON:</font> I don't know.

729
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:05,508
If you'd asked me a year ago, I might
have said no, never, I'm a career man.

730
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:09,091
But you know how it goes. You meet
someone. you get a little older.

731
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,727
All of a sudden, your career
doesn't seem to matter so much.

732
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:16,311
You want kids. you start to see other
people with kids and think "I want that"

733
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:20,103
and then you wonder "Is he gonna look
like me? Is she gonna look like her?"

734
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,404
You paint rooms in your head and...

735
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,205
Time for bed.

Mr. Oswalt, sorry it took so long
to get back to you.

789
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,567
There's been
so little written on Bughuul

790
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:10,030
that no one has actually bothered
to scan any of this material before.

791
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,195
- Well, what am I looking at?
- You're looking at an engraving.

792
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:17,116
An old sketch from the Dark Ages.
And fragments of a deteriorated fresco.

793
01:32:17,282 --> 01:32:19,831
There isn't a lot left.
Everything else has been destroyed.

794
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:21,586
- Why?
- Well, superstition.

795
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:26,376
Early Christians believed that Bughuul
actually lived in the images themselves

796
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:29,010
and that they were gateways
into his realm.

797
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,637
- Gateways?
- Yes.

798
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,219
The ancient Church believed
that he would take possession

799
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:38,850
of those who saw the images
and cause them to do terrible mings,

800
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:43,358
or in some cases he could even abduct
the viewer into the images themselves,

801
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:46,065
Children exposed to the images

802
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:50,903
were especially vulnerable to
Bughuul's possession and/or abduction.

803
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:54,286
- What if you destroyed 'em?
- Sorry. I don't follow.

804
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:58,074
If you destroyed the images with a fire,
what would happen then?

805
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:01,334
What, do you mean literally
or in the stories?

806
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:04,463
In the stories
if an image was destroyed,

807
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,130
then the gateway would be closed

808
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:10,294
and Bughuul would no longer
have access to this world, right?

809
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:15,808
Mr Oswalt, what kind of book
are you writing exactly?

810
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:22,181
I don't know. I'm not even sure
I have a book any more.

- Okay, the problem is that you moved.

How is that a problem?

819
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,539
I was compiling all of the data
that you had me collecting

820
01:35:49,702 --> 01:35:52,626
and once I started putting it together
into a nice readable package.

821
01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:54,336
I saw the connection, it was obvious.

822
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:57,378
- What was it?
- The dates, the addresses.

823
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:59,136
Each family that you had me look up

824
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:03,596
had previously lived in the house where
one of the earlier murders took place.

825
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,102
Each family? All five of them?

826
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,561
Yes, and when you put them
in chronological order,

827
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:12,817
you can actually draw a line
from murder to murder to murder.

828
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:15,274
Okay, we knew
that the Stevensons previously lived

829
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,815
in the same St Louis house
where the Millers had their throats cut,

830
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,484
Before the Miller family was killed,

831
01:36:20,692 --> 01:36:22,820
the Millers lived in the same house
in Orange County

832
01:36:22,986 --> 01:36:25,114
where the De Luzio
lawn massacre occurred.

833
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,409
Guess where the De Luzios lived
before they moved to Orange County?

834
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:31,794
Sacramento where the Martinez family
was burned in their garage?

835
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:35,924
Exactly. The pattern goes back
to the 1966 Oregon drownings.

836
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,086
Listen, Mr. Oswalt, you just moved out
of the last house in line.
