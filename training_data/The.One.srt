- This is your last warning.

61

It won't work for you anymore, Yulaw.

86

The shortest distance
between two points...

87
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,369
will always be a straight line.

88

You don't see that?

of first-degree murder...

106

114
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:28,472

I just try to make it rational.
I just try to make it neat.

117

You call it murder.

How could I murder myself 123 times?

119
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:48,034
I just took those wasted energies...

120
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:50,620

127
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,644

00:22:43,604 --> 00:22:45,231
I need a hand over here!

167
00:22:58,494 --> 00:22:59,787
Hey.

168
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:11,883
Hey, on the bus!

169
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,390
He's going OJ!

170
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:20,767
- Get him!
- Let's go, Yates!

171
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:22,310
I'm on him.

172
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:53,675
Gabe!

173
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:03,894
Gabe!

174
00:24:04,436 --> 00:24:05,729
You see that?

175
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:12,027
The good news is you're not crazy.

176
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,905
The bad news...

177
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:38,721
I lived here my whole life.

178
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:41,641
You know, and everywhere
I look for great memories.

179
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:46,938
And now all I see
is Larry and those kids.

180
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,326
Gabe.

181
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,036
Oh, my God!

182
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,413
I'm okay.

183
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:05,957
- I'm okay.
- Aldrich called.

184
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,167
He said you were in the hospital.

185
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,753
- Yeah, I was.
- Did they check you out?

186
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:13,214
I checked myself.
Nothing to check. See?

187
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:17,552
I just need to get myself clear.

188
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:18,929
Hey, Ollie.

189
00:25:19,095 --> 00:25:21,389
You were shot.
You need to be examined.

190
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:22,849
You can do it.

191
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:26,144
Newsflash. I'm a vet.
You don't have paws and a tail.

192
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:27,604
With the stuff
that's been happening to you...

193
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:29,648
you need to see someone.

194
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:32,442
I'm seeing the only person
I need to see.

195
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:33,694
I'm serious.

196
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,989
[Chinese]

197
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:41,577
Okay, we'll go to the hospital,
check out on Woo...

198
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:43,120
after I'm done.

199
00:25:43,245 --> 00:25:44,538
[Chinese]

200
00:26:46,601 --> 00:26:48,103
You'll be all right, man.

201
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,814
- You guys take care of him now.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:54,609
Gabe?

203
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:57,028
- Hey, T.K.
- How is he?

204
00:26:57,487 --> 00:27:00,574
External injuries mostly.
EMT said he's seen a lot worse.

205
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:03,869
You gave us a bigger scare
just leaving the hospital like that.

206
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:06,413
Your man went deep tonight, T.K.

207
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:08,540
Don't know how the hell
he made it up that wall.

208
00:27:09,124 --> 00:27:13,045
I wouldn't be here if you guys
didn't make it up right behind me.

209
00:27:15,088 --> 00:27:16,799
We never made it up that wall, Gabe.

210
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:20,135
I didn't make it out
of the goddamn parking lot.

211
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:23,639
Backup unit reported you down.
We continued pursuit, unsuccessful.

212
00:27:23,889 --> 00:27:25,683
You're the only one who got
a good look at the suspect.

213
00:27:25,766 --> 00:27:27,351
We need a description.

214
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,480
You think it's someone
out of Ronnie's posse?

215
00:27:31,564 --> 00:27:33,440
Payback for snitching?

216
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:35,234
It was dark.

217
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,528
You have anything? Anything to go on?

218
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,113
Sorry.

219
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:42,908
If you remember anything,
we'll be down the hall.

220
00:27:44,577 --> 00:27:47,038
Hey, man,
I'm glad you're still with us.

221
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:49,040
Thanks.

222
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:50,875
Hey!

223
00:27:52,043 --> 00:27:53,753
Why did you lie to them?

224
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,713
It was dark.

225
00:27:55,922 --> 00:27:59,801
Gabe, it's not the guys. It's me.

226
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:08,351
It was me.

227
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,854
What?

228
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:15,525
He wasn't trying to hit Ronnie.
He was aiming at me!

229
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,904
Before I saw him, I felt him.

230
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:22,157
I felt me!

231
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:25,201
It was me.

232
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:30,999
Maybe the adrenaline caused
some kind of hallucination.

233
00:28:31,082 --> 00:28:33,376
Look, you were shot. Your memory
could've been affected...

234
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,003
by the trauma.

235
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,299
Or maybe it's part of
what's been happening to you.

236
00:28:40,717 --> 00:28:43,428
People get older, Gabe.
They don't get stronger.

237
00:28:43,595 --> 00:28:45,847
They don't get faster
all of a sudden.

238
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:53,647
Whatever it is,
we're here now, right?

239
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,779
And if they find
something wrong with me?

240
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,949
I don't want to lose my job.

241
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,037
I don't want to lose you.

242
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:15,086
Okay, Mrs. Law,
before we go into the MRl room...

243
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:18,381
I just have some guestions
I have to ask you about your husband.

244
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,967
- Does he have a cardiac pacemaker?
- No.

245
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,219
- Intracranial aneurysm clip?
- No.

246
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:26,639
Dentures, hearing aid
or penile implant?

247
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:30,893
No, and not unless he had one put in
since this morning.

248
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,511
Okay, Mr. Law. Right this way.

249
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,304
I just have a few forms
for you to fill out.

250
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,722
Now, this is a painless procedure...

251
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,475
so there's absolutely nothing
for you to worry about.

252
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,103
Dressing room's right in here.
Remove all your clothing.

253
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,563
You'll find a gown on a hook.

254
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,856
I have some forms for you to sign.

255
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,357
The paperwork's already started
so we should be able...

256
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,359
to get you in and out of here
in absolutely no time.

257
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:22,070
Please remove
all personal metallic objects.

258
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,199
That means no keys, no watches,
no credit cards...

259
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,284
no body piercings, no cell phones...

260
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,502
- My gun.
- No guns...

261
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,795
- no jewelry, no belt buckles...
- What?

262
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,506
- no zippers.
- The hospital has it.

263
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:43,551
You're going in for an MRl. Gabe?

264
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,554
Remember what I said?

265
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,681
I feel it again.

266
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,851
When you're done, we'll go down
and get your things, all right?

267
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,728
They're not giving her your gun.

268
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:56,314
The guys are downstairs.
They can get the gun.

269
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,190
And even if they did,
you're not bringing it in here.

270
00:30:58,274 --> 00:31:00,526
That's a powerful, precise,
expensive magnet.

271
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,903
T.K.

272
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,364
All right.

273
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,951
If you start the MRl,
I'll find the guys.

274
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:10,912
Lose the wedding ring.

275
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,417
Here. I got it.

276
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:41,693
For Christ's sake,
you're getting an MRl...

277
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,820
not a heart transplant.

278
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,627
Mr. Law, I need you
to remain perfectly still...

279
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,337
for three to ten minutes.

280
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,842
You can talk, but if you move,
we have to start all over.

281
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:38,125
- Hey.
- Hey. Where did you guys go?

282
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:39,502
I took him in for a...

283
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,338
Something wrong, T.K.?
Can I get you something?

284
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,637
No, I have to talk to the doctor.

285
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:05,987
Mike, I can't take my break
till I'm done with this guy.

286
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,822
Can you wait half an hour?

287
00:33:11,409 --> 00:33:13,411
Man, Mr. Law, what are you doing?

288
00:33:13,495 --> 00:33:15,664
Now we have to start over.

289
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:17,666
Why? What did I do?

290
00:33:20,752 --> 00:33:22,087
Back away!

291
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:26,299
Thought you were gonna kill me.

292
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,552
Just give me the chance, asshole.

293
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,015
Get on your knees slowly.

294
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:34,600
You there?

295
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,104
On the floor, right now!

296
00:33:39,354 --> 00:33:40,647
The floor?

297
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:42,149
This is a hospital.

298
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:44,443
The floor is full of germs.

299
00:33:44,651 --> 00:33:45,944
You want me to get sick?

300
00:33:56,205 --> 00:33:57,498
It's gunfire.

301
00:33:58,124 --> 00:33:59,834
Let's get the security.

302
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:01,627
Gabe.

303
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:12,346
Get back!

304
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:27,236
What have you got?

305
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:30,281
Nothing. Not a thing.

306
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:46,339
No!

307
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:49,342
Be still.

308
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:05,150
Unit 15, weapon fire, south tower!

309
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:07,527
<i>Fourth floor, Imaging Radiology!</i>

310
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:08,904
Gabe is there.

311
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:14,368
- Hands high! Yulaw!
- Don't move!

312
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:24,336
We all know if you kill me,
you have to kill the other guy.

313
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:28,674
- Just let me take out one leg.
- Cuff him.

314
00:35:29,508 --> 00:35:30,801
I'll cover you.

315
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:33,220
Go.

316
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:36,515
Back, get back!

317
00:35:53,658 --> 00:35:55,660
- It's Gabe.
- Go! Channel 7.

318
00:35:56,035 --> 00:35:57,578
Swing the camera. Follow him.

319
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:01,124
He cut right at the end of the hall.

320
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:04,794
Don't move! Stay here!

321
00:36:05,003 --> 00:36:06,296
Go back to the room.

322
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:28,944
T.K., you can't go up there!

323
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:46,086
Which one is he?

324
00:36:48,422 --> 00:36:50,382
- Hey!
- I'm okay. I'm all right.

325
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,968
Don't move, Gabe!
We're here to help you.

326
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,596
- I said I'm all right.
- Do you know where you are?

327
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:59,058
- What's wrong with you?
- Where are you, Gabe?

328
00:37:00,267 --> 00:37:03,062
Look, there are three armed men.
They killed a security officer.

329
00:37:03,145 --> 00:37:04,813
- Do you know who we are?
- They went down the hallway.

330
00:37:04,939 --> 00:37:07,024
- What's my name, Gabe?
- I was unarmed.

331
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:08,400
I couldn't go after them.

332
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:10,152
What did you do with the gun?

333
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,948
I don't have one.
I asked T.K. to get it.

334
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:15,491
Yulaw wouldn't have known that.

335
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:18,703
This one's safer in their custody.
Let them take him.

336
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:20,830
We gotta get you some help
before you hurt yourself.

337
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:22,248
Or anyone else.

338
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,334
Anyone else?
Someone tried to kill me!

339
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:28,796
Please! I don't want
to hurt you guys.

340
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,465
Gabe! What...

341
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:35,678
Let go of me!

342
00:37:35,803 --> 00:37:37,096
I don't want to hurt you.

343
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,602
I don't want to hurt you guys.

344
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,174
He's close to Yulaw's strength.

345
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:15,135
Let go!

346
00:38:15,385 --> 00:38:16,678
Gabe!

347
00:38:17,304 --> 00:38:19,723
It's what I told you. It's me.

348
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:23,769
Get home.

349
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:28,649
We have a problem here.

350
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:32,903
Yeah, the real problem is
procedure sucks...

351
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,072
sir.

352
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:42,746
All right, new procedure.

353
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:46,292
Gabe is yours. I will take Yulaw.

354
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:48,461
How you gonna do that?

355
00:38:48,711 --> 00:38:50,588
I'll do whatever it takes.

356
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:53,549
Sync up your repeater.

357
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,053
Hey, wait a minute.

358
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,389
I've lived through one of those.

359
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:02,642
Let me do it.

360
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:04,685
Sync your repeater, Funsch.

361
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:11,609
All right.

362
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,697
When the green light turns red
and stays steady...

363
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,073
and Yulaw is dead...

364
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:18,449
And you.

365
00:39:19,117 --> 00:39:20,660
You know what to do.

366
00:39:28,752 --> 00:39:30,128
Not a problem.

367
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:35,550
Funsch, us splitting up,
you going solo...

368
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,969
is way out of procedure.

369
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:41,097
So listen to me.
I know where you're from...

370
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:44,351
I know what you've been through.
But this place is different.

371
00:39:44,476 --> 00:39:46,812
Not everyone is a combatant.

372
00:39:47,104 --> 00:39:49,731
There are innocent people here, also.

373
00:39:49,982 --> 00:39:53,652
So if you get into the shit,
you trust your heart...

374
00:39:53,735 --> 00:39:55,487
not your head.

375
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,950
Loud and clear, sir.

376
00:40:04,037 --> 00:40:06,623
How did that son of a bitch
get out of here?

377
00:40:08,917 --> 00:40:11,587
Have you seen that new video,
<i>Mr. Fanny's Been A-Pluggin'</i>?

378
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,047
It's pretty hot!

379
00:40:13,297 --> 00:40:14,590
Dude, I like Janine.

380
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:18,928
But she don't do guys, man.
That girl-girl stuff gets old.

381
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,262
Why don't you just rent...

382
00:40:20,346 --> 00:40:22,973
one of those big-ass,
she-male tapes, you freak?

383
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:25,434
Shut up!

384
00:40:31,774 --> 00:40:33,985
I can't determine
occipital lobe swelling...

385
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:35,570
without a complete MRl.

386
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:37,363
He was acting like schizophrenic
that are brought in.

387
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:39,198
Schizophrenia doesn't
just kick in.

388
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:42,410
The triggering stressor of being shot
caused a psychotic break.

389
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,203
- Mrs Law.
- T.K.

390
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:47,457
The entire Fifth Division
is looking for him.

391
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,793
They understand he's not himself.
They know how to bring him in.

392
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:51,961
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

393
00:40:52,045 --> 00:40:55,215
- Need a doctor? T.K.
- No, I'm all right.

394
00:40:55,632 --> 00:40:58,510
I am not going to let anything
happen to him.

395
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,596
If it wasn't for Gabe,
I wouldn't be in this uniform.

396
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,056
Thanks, Bobby.

397
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,226
- Maybe it's best if I go home. Yeah.
- Good idea.

398
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:07,519
Nothing you can do here...

399
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:09,062
he's likely to try
to contact you there.

400
00:41:09,145 --> 00:41:10,605
If I hear from him,
I'll let you know.

401
00:41:10,689 --> 00:41:12,566
And if you hear anything,
I'll be home.

402
00:41:12,649 --> 00:41:14,401
I know. I'm going to take you.

403
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,486
I really appreciate it,
but I'm gonna be fine.

404
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,654
- I promise.
- We're gonna make sure of it.

405
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:20,115
There's four units on the way
to your house right now.

406
00:41:20,198 --> 00:41:21,533
Come on.

407
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:40,302
Okay. Circle around.

408
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:42,012
- I'll meet you out front.
- All right.

409
00:42:45,368 --> 00:42:48,204
Just when I find something I like
in this universe.

410
00:42:48,288 --> 00:42:50,624
Turn off the radio slowly.

411
00:43:25,534 --> 00:43:27,036
Hey.

412
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:31,665
Who are you?

413
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:34,251
You're close to his strength.

414
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:36,796
The last two years,
you've gotten stronger.

415
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:39,590
Haven't jacked any more iron.
Haven't changed your diet.

416
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:41,425
But you are stronger.

417
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,388
Your mind, too.
Answers come fast without thinking.

418
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,224
Who are you? What did you do to me?

419
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:51,310
Not me. You.

420
00:43:51,978 --> 00:43:53,688
You've done this to yourself.

421
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:03,948
Just like old times, eh, buddy?

422
00:44:04,115 --> 00:44:05,658
Not exactly...

423
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:07,827
buddy.

424
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:10,622
Put your hands
back on the wheel, Yulaw.

425
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,796
Space is shaped like this.

426
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:20,298
You believe
this is the only universe.

427
00:44:20,382 --> 00:44:24,094
There's not just one universe,
there's a Multiverse.

428
00:44:24,344 --> 00:44:27,472
Every time a massive star dies
and becomes a black hole...

429
00:44:27,556 --> 00:44:29,891
a new universe is created.

430
00:44:31,601 --> 00:44:33,478
They've learned to forecast,
like the weather...

431
00:44:33,562 --> 00:44:35,897
where and when
a black hole will occur.

432
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:38,859
A momentary bridge
between parallel universes.

433
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,402
Travel is restricted.

434
00:44:40,485 --> 00:44:43,697
They created an agency
to police the Multiverse.

435
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:46,033
I'm a Multiverse agent.

436
00:44:46,658 --> 00:44:48,494
You're a nut.

437
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:51,413
You're the one
who's been seeing yourself.

438
00:44:51,997 --> 00:44:55,125
In this universe, you're you.
In another, you don't exist.

439
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:56,835
In another, you're married
to the same woman.

440
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:58,587
In another, you're married
to a different woman.

441
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,130
In another, you're married to a man.

442
00:45:00,214 --> 00:45:02,341
- Hey.
- There's an energy...

443
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,344
strain, wave,
connecting all those lives.

444
00:45:05,427 --> 00:45:06,470
We all have one.

445
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:09,515
The one between you and him
has gotten stronger.

446
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,768
You've been feeling him, haven't you?

447
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:17,857
You know, Harry,
nobody's proved that...

448
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,276
what I'm doing is a bad thing.

449
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:21,861
You've killed 123 people.

450
00:45:21,944 --> 00:45:24,864
I'd say that was
a very bad thing, Yulaw.

451
00:45:24,947 --> 00:45:26,824
Plus, you don't know what'd happen
if you killed this one.

452
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:28,201
His death could destroy
the whole system...

453
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:30,578
- but I guess that doesn't matter.
- I know.

454
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,414
Everything must be balanced.
Bla bla bla.

455
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:34,999
The party line.

456
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,627
What do you think would happen?

457
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:42,090
Some people think you'd explode,
some people think you'd implode.

458
00:45:43,258 --> 00:45:44,717
You're missing one.

459
00:45:46,636 --> 00:45:49,180
Some people think you'd become a god.

460
00:45:49,389 --> 00:45:50,974
That's the one.

461
00:46:52,161 --> 00:46:54,830
The man you've been
seeing, the "you"...

462
00:46:54,997 --> 00:46:56,832
he was an MVA agent.

463
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,168
Once, on assignment,
he was forced to defend himself...

464
00:46:59,252 --> 00:47:02,171
against a form of himself
in another universe.

465
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:04,048
Killed him.

466
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:06,384
In doing so...

467
00:47:06,467 --> 00:47:09,470
part of the other life's energy
transferred to him.

468
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,057
Made him stronger.
Made all of you stronger.

469
00:47:13,725 --> 00:47:15,602
Each time he kills one of you...

470
00:47:15,727 --> 00:47:18,104
the energy divides
among the survivors.

471
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:20,690
So, I'm next?

472
00:47:21,441 --> 00:47:23,067
You're the last.

473
00:47:24,027 --> 00:47:26,446
You and him are it.

474
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,862
I don't want any part of this.

475
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:09,782
You don't have a choice.

476
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:22,962
First choice, give up.
Second choice, die.

477
00:48:27,133 --> 00:48:28,884
Third choice.

478
00:48:36,684 --> 00:48:39,312
So, if everything you say is true...

479
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:43,816
what happens to me?

480
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:47,111
Nobody's got all the answers.

481
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:50,531
I don't believe you. Stay away.

482
00:49:45,921 --> 00:49:47,715
I'm alone now.

483
00:49:48,716 --> 00:49:50,634
I'm here to help you, Gabe.

484
00:50:02,104 --> 00:50:04,273
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to hold it right there.

485
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,697
I said freeze, asshole!

486
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:23,251
Don't you people ever learn?

487
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:52,049
Clear.

488
00:51:58,264 --> 00:52:00,058
Let them have a look first.

489
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:03,061
I've got to do my girl stuff.

490
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:07,732
Thanks.

491
00:53:02,496 --> 00:53:03,789
TV is on.

492
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:05,958
Yeah, I left it on.

493
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:09,336
When I got the call about Gabe,
I just ran.

494
00:53:09,545 --> 00:53:12,840
Grabbed my jacket, rushed downstairs.

495
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,216
I'll turn it off.

496
00:53:38,658 --> 00:53:40,076
Bobby?

497
00:53:40,785 --> 00:53:42,579
I really appreciate
all of you being here with me...

498
00:53:42,662 --> 00:53:45,623
and I don't want
to sound rude, but...

499
00:53:45,707 --> 00:53:47,459
Can I have a little privacy?

500
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:50,086
Sorry, T.K.

501
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:57,469
I'll be right outside.

502
00:53:57,844 --> 00:53:59,137
Thanks.

503
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,143
Hey.

504
00:54:47,395 --> 00:54:49,230
I told you it's not wasted space.

505
00:54:49,939 --> 00:54:51,357
You all right?

506
00:54:52,066 --> 00:54:55,361
- I'm afraid.
- Yeah, me too.

507
00:54:57,321 --> 00:54:59,073
Is it safe to come down?

508
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:01,868
No, there are sheriffs all over.

509
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:04,078
I need my gun.

510
00:55:05,538 --> 00:55:07,248
I left it at the hospital.

511
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:09,792
I need a weapon.

512
00:55:12,754 --> 00:55:14,047
T.K.

513
00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:16,382
Yeah, okay.

514
00:55:51,585 --> 00:55:52,878
What's wrong?

515
00:55:53,754 --> 00:55:55,047
Nothing.

516
00:55:55,506 --> 00:55:58,467
They can see inside.
I'm just gonna pull the shade.

517
00:56:04,223 --> 00:56:05,516
T.K.

518
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:23,576
Jesus, Gabe.

519
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:25,786
Did you ever think when we met
that day at the bookstore...

520
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,580
we'd be in this kind of mess?

521
00:56:33,252 --> 00:56:36,422
Even if I knew,
I still would have come in.

522
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:39,675
It wasn't a bookstore.

523
00:56:40,802 --> 00:56:43,805
Just so you know,
I'm going to take that gun...

524
00:56:43,888 --> 00:56:47,183
and kill you
before you can pull the trigger.

525
00:56:47,392 --> 00:56:51,646
There's nothing you can do
except give it to me.

526
00:56:52,564 --> 00:56:53,857
Aldrich!

527
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:08,622
- Gabe.
- Don't!

528
00:57:09,497 --> 00:57:10,790
Don't!

529
00:57:16,588 --> 00:57:17,881
Gabe, drop it!

530
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,218
Drop it now!

531
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:25,264
Drop it!

532
00:57:28,308 --> 00:57:29,601
Gabe.

533
00:58:01,092 --> 00:58:02,468
Gabe, get in!

534
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:20,862
Hey, knock it off!

535
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:25,158
- You're acting like him.
- I am him!

536
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:27,744
Without her.

537
00:58:59,693 --> 00:59:01,653
My grandfather taught me...

538
00:59:01,737 --> 00:59:04,615
the energy of life
goes in a circle...

539
00:59:04,698 --> 00:59:07,284
in a perfect flow, balanced.

540
00:59:07,993 --> 00:59:11,080
He said, until I find my center...

541
00:59:11,163 --> 00:59:13,540
my circle would never be whole.

542
00:59:15,376 --> 00:59:18,379
That day, I first saw her
in the clinic...

543
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:22,675
I came in with a dog
that was hit by a car.

544
00:59:24,301 --> 00:59:27,429
I knew right away she was my center.

545
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:29,473
She made me whole.

546
00:59:33,686 --> 00:59:35,146
How do I kill him?

547
00:59:45,948 --> 00:59:48,534
In about an hour, there's
a forecasted wormhole opening.

548
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,911
Three-minute window.

549
00:59:54,207 --> 00:59:56,334
He's attuned to your life wave.

550
00:59:57,085 --> 01:00:00,296
He'll try to find you, kill you,
and get back to the hole.

551
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,340
That's where we get him.

552
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,301
Get him? Kill him!

553
01:00:05,677 --> 01:00:06,970
Kill him?

554
01:00:08,221 --> 01:00:09,889
You're serious?

555
01:00:19,024 --> 01:00:20,108
My own design.

556
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:22,694
Highly modified M-590,
hand-portable system.

557
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:25,197
Fires 25 smart rounds per second.

558
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,075
Multiple tracking modes,
plus the latest countermeasures.

559
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:31,244
Each round carries a high-explosive
anti-person warhead...

560
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,954
with selectable fuse delays.

561
01:00:33,038 --> 01:00:38,085
Tracks, enters, pauses.
1 microseconds, then "Boom!"

562
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:39,461
Mixto rojo.

563
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,216
And this is his little brother.

564
01:00:45,134 --> 01:00:46,552
Hasn't worked yet.

565
01:00:47,094 --> 01:00:48,637
Don't blame the tools.

566
01:00:48,887 --> 01:00:51,015
I never had the go-ahead
to terminate.

567
01:00:51,265 --> 01:00:52,766
Let me show you how.

568
01:01:02,443 --> 01:01:04,069
Yeah, that'll work, too.

569
01:01:04,195 --> 01:01:06,238
We kill him, then it's over.

570
01:01:07,114 --> 01:01:09,367
Hey, you two!

571
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,535
Come on! Check that shit!

572
01:01:14,664 --> 01:01:15,957
Let's go.

573
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:19,585
What are you doing?

574
01:01:21,629 --> 01:01:23,422
Permission to speak, sir.

575
01:01:25,133 --> 01:01:26,884
I know what I gotta do.

576
01:01:27,468 --> 01:01:30,555
I'll never get the chance to say
thank you for sguaring me away.

577
01:01:32,807 --> 01:01:34,309
So, thank you, sir.

578
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,771
I'm calling the cops.

579
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:45,904
Gabe.

580
01:01:46,488 --> 01:01:48,615
Just making sure you know,
if we kill him...

581
01:01:48,698 --> 01:01:51,993
You have to kill me.
Kill me! I don't care.

582
01:01:52,577 --> 01:01:55,956
As long as he's dead, I don't care.

583
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:59,543
If we kill him,
there's a chance, some say...

584
01:01:59,626 --> 01:02:01,962
this whole universe
could go with him.

585
01:02:08,135 --> 01:02:10,637
Yeah, the Chinese guy
was tearing the place apart.

586
01:02:31,742 --> 01:02:34,787
Wormhole ETA: Ten minutes.

587
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:36,872
That vicinity.

588
01:03:02,231 --> 01:03:03,733
He's here.

589
01:03:51,949 --> 01:03:53,826
Shit. Take cover!

590
01:03:53,909 --> 01:03:57,621
It's a bomb! Don't breathe
for 20 seconds after the blast!

591
01:04:27,068 --> 01:04:28,361
Gabe.

592
01:04:33,699 --> 01:04:34,992
Gabe.

593
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:43,376
Gabe.

594
01:06:21,684 --> 01:06:23,269
Yulaw!

595
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:26,064
You came here for me.

596
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:29,400
Now I'm here for you.

597
01:06:32,404 --> 01:06:36,741
After this, there will be only one.

598
01:06:37,117 --> 01:06:38,702
I won't be The One...

599
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:40,620
but neither will you.

600
01:10:29,228 --> 01:10:31,438
Shit! Three minutes.

601
01:13:37,419 --> 01:13:39,380
Thirty seconds!

602
01:13:46,804 --> 01:13:48,097
Shit.

603
01:13:59,775 --> 01:14:01,861
Gabe, get out!

604
01:14:02,153 --> 01:14:03,446
Get out!

605
01:14:34,352 --> 01:14:35,645
That's him.

606
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:46,698
Scanning, RHV 579. Confirm.

607
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:49,576
Send him where he belongs.

608
01:15:02,714 --> 01:15:07,678
<i>Destination:
Stygian Penal Colony, Hades Universe.</i>

609
01:15:08,262 --> 01:15:11,849
<i>Wormhole opens in one minute.</i>

610
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:32,411
No, stop!

611
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,705
That's him, that's Yulaw.

612
01:15:35,247 --> 01:15:39,252
<i>Wormhole opens in 30 seconds.</i>

613
01:15:40,211 --> 01:15:41,504
Get him out!

614
01:15:45,299 --> 01:15:49,262
<i>Wormhole opens in 20 seconds.</i>

615
01:15:55,143 --> 01:15:58,605
<i>Wormhole opens in ten, nine...</i>

616
01:15:58,688 --> 01:16:00,607
<i>eight, seven...</i>

617
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:05,195
<i>six, five, four, three, two...</i>

618
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,362
<i>one.</i>

619
01:16:06,446 --> 01:16:08,323
<i>Wormhole opened.</i>

620
01:16:24,798 --> 01:16:26,633
That man doesn't leave this room.

621
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,431
Sir, he assisted in Yulaw's capture.

622
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:36,143
He's from an uninitiated universe
with no travel passport.

623
01:16:36,268 --> 01:16:37,686
He goes back.

624
01:16:38,103 --> 01:16:40,397
He can't go back.
They'll lock him up for life.

625
01:16:40,481 --> 01:16:43,192
He will be cared for, watched over.
Like the other.

626
01:16:43,484 --> 01:16:45,235
Balance will be preserved.

627
01:16:45,486 --> 01:16:47,654
The wormhole closes in 40 seconds!

628
01:16:47,738 --> 01:16:49,865
- Sir, permission to speak...
- Permission denied.

629
01:16:49,948 --> 01:16:51,909
That order is bullshit!

630
01:16:51,992 --> 01:16:53,285
Funsch.

631
01:16:55,037 --> 01:16:56,789
It doesn't matter.

632
01:16:57,414 --> 01:16:58,707
Take him!

633
01:17:22,523 --> 01:17:24,150
I know where he has to go.

634
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:29,030
I have to send you where you belong.

635
01:17:33,368 --> 01:17:34,869
It's procedure.

636
01:17:37,497 --> 01:17:39,749
<i>Coordinates accepted.</i>

637
01:17:41,793 --> 01:17:43,086
'Bye, Gabe.

638
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:50,760
<i>Wormhole opens in
five, four, three, two, one.</i>

639
01:17:59,269 --> 01:18:00,562
Look out!

640
01:18:03,607 --> 01:18:04,900
Hey, you all right?

641
01:18:17,454 --> 01:18:18,747
Ollie?

642
01:18:37,224 --> 01:18:39,560
Excuse me, I have a...

643
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:41,896
What happened?

644
01:18:47,985 --> 01:18:49,362
Car.

645
01:18:51,697 --> 01:18:53,074
Do I know you?

646
01:19:16,264 --> 01:19:19,351
- Fresh fish.
- Got a pretty mouth.

647
01:19:20,602 --> 01:19:22,062
I am Yulaw!

648
01:19:22,437 --> 01:19:24,189
I'm nobody's bitch.

649
01:19:24,397 --> 01:19:27,150
You are mine.

650
01:19:30,237 --> 01:19:31,863
I don't need to know you.

651
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:35,951
You only need to know me.

652
01:19:37,202 --> 01:19:39,162
I will be The One!
