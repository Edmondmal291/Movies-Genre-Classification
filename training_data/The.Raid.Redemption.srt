00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:25,230
Hi, I'm Gareth Evans.
I'm the writer-director of The <i>Raid.</i>

2
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,566
And in this commentary
I'm gonna talk to you...

3
00:00:27,567 --> 00:00:30,819
...about the sort of inception
of this film, and how I ended up...

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,906
...being a Welshman
living out in Indonesia.

5
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:35,782
So basically, when I was--

6
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:40,496
All throughout my life I lived in Wales,
and up until I was 27, I kind of--

7
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:44,249
I'd dreamt of being in the industry,
but not doing enough to push myself.

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,252
I hadn't done enough
to get on peoples' radar in the UK.

9
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:51,965
And my wife was Indonesian-Japanese
and so we were--

10
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:54,843
We were living in Wales for a while
and we hadn't settled.

11
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:56,803
I hadn't done enough to get noticed.

12
00:00:56,804 --> 00:00:59,556
She was sort of not comfortable
where we were either...

13
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:03,685
...and so she got me a directing gig
doing a documentary out in Indonesia.

14
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:05,771
And that documentary
was about silat.

15
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:07,731
And all throughout my childhood...

16
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:10,067
...I'd been obsessed
with martial-arts films...

17
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:13,487
...so I'd been a big fan of Bruce Lee
and Jet Li and Jackie Chan...

18
00:01:13,488 --> 00:01:17,074
...and all throughout my childhood
I'd watched those films over and over.

19
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:20,536
And so I had a love and affinity
for martial arts as a genre...

20
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:23,664
...but I never ever thought
that I'd end up making these films.

21
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:26,875
And so when I ended up in Indonesia
and seeing silat...

22
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:29,336
...it was the first time I'd seen
that discipline.

23
00:01:29,337 --> 00:01:31,797
So I'd been familiar with kung fu
and Muay Thai...

24
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:35,592
...and, you know, aikido and karate
and judo, but never silat.

25
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:39,680
The one thing I loved about silat was
it had this very sort of fluid style to it.

26
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:43,892
It's got a-- It's very adaptable to sort
of, you know, small, tight spaces...

27
00:01:43,893 --> 00:01:47,062
...and then wide-open spaces
and multiple attackers.

28
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:51,066
So when I ended up going out
to Indonesia to do that documentary...

29
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,235
...it was my introduction to silat.

30
00:01:53,236 --> 00:01:56,488
And throughout the six months
that I worked on that documentary...

31
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:59,116
...I got to meet a lot
of different masters...

32
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,994
...of a lot of different schools
in Indonesia.

33
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,746
All of different styles
and different backgrounds.

34
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:08,917
And throughout the course of that, I
learned traditions, cultures, practices.

35
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,961
But then luckily, I met this guy, lko.

36
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,504
So he ended up being--

37
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:17,050
He was actually a delivery guy for
a phone company when I first met him.

38
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:20,220
And so when I met him,
it was at his master's house...

39
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:23,640
...and his master's from a style of silat
called tiga berantai...

40
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,892
...which is Betawi-based, in Jakarta.

41
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:29,062
And so we went to the sort of--
The class.

42
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:31,940
And when I saw lko at first,
when I met him...

43
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:33,984
...he didn't seem
like anything special.

44
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:35,944
He was this unassuming guy,
you know...

45
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:38,614
...nothing sort of, you know,
too incredible about him.

46
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:40,824
But then once he did
his practice session...

47
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:45,162
...and put on, like, the silat uniform
and started practicing, he transformed.

48
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:47,164
In that transformation,
I kind of saw--

49
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,708
I saw that he had a screen presence
about him.

50
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,502
And something which I felt was,
you know...

51
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:54,504
...great for film
and great for cinema...

52
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:57,966
...so I ended up elbowing my wife,
telling her we gotta get this guy...

53
00:02:57,967 --> 00:02:59,843
...and we gotta make him a film star.

54
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:04,634
So since then we've worked
together on the last two films...

55
00:03:04,635 --> 00:03:06,094
...and this is The <i>Raid.</i>
This is his second film.

56
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:08,429
With The <i>Raid,</i>
I wanted to approach the film...

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,598
...a little bit differently
from Merantau.

58
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,519
In Merantau, we took a long time
to sort of get to the action.

59
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,896
You know, we dwelled a lot on,
you know...

60
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:20,191
...setting out the drama elements,
and the sort of--

61
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,776
The tradition and the culture.

62
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:24,946
And I spent a long time
kind of, you know...

63
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:28,616
...getting character stuff out of the way
before we could get to the fight.

64
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:32,286
The way Merantau was structured,
we didn't get to our first fight scene...

65
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:35,873
...for like 45 minutes, which was way,
way, way too long for us to do.

66
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:38,334
On this one,
I wanted to come right out to bat...

67
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:40,837
...go into the fight scenes,
go into the action...

68
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:43,423
...so I didn't wanna waste
too much time doing that.

69
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:47,593
We had this streamlined introduction
and then we go straight into the truck.

70
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,471
And the purpose of that
is to kind of just jump right in...

71
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:53,850
...and have this, you know,
fast start to the film...

72
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:56,894
...and, you know, set the tone
and set the atmosphere...

73
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:59,230
...and then go all-out then
with the action...

74
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:02,066
...and kind of have
this relentless pace then.

75
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,987
Earlier we saw lko doing this sort
of, like, preparation with exercise...

76
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:08,990
...and then prayer and, you know,
saying goodbye to his wife.

77
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:11,659
It was important to me to have
this moment in there...

78
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,621
...where we're showing his spiritual,
mental and physical preparation...

79
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,291
...before he goes out
on this mission.

80
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:22,003
It was quite the-- You know, without
kind of being too political about it...

81
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:26,049
...there was a reason why we wanted
to show that he was a Muslim.

82
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,302
Because, you know, living out
in Indonesia for four years...

83
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:32,680
...and being there for that long a time
and, you know, knowing lko...

84
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:35,141
...and knowing all the guys
I've worked with...

85
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,352
...their religion, it's something
that they carry in their heart.

86
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:41,022
It's something that they have
in their everyday life.

87
00:04:41,023 --> 00:04:43,232
And that's the way I wanted
to present it.

88
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:46,736
Not for it to be, like, a political tool.
I didn't want it to be like--

89
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:49,197
In a lot of media,
there's two versions of it.

90
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:53,159
You see Islam as a negative thing and
you see Islam as a preaching thing.

91
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,328
I wanted it to be an everyday thing.

92
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,289
This is our hero, this is what it is,
it's part of his life.

93
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,041
But it's not preaching to anyone.

94
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:03,002
And I felt that that was
an important element to the film...

95
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,838
...and element to his character
as well.

96
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,839
So this is our introduction to Tama,
the boss of the building.

97
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,555
I wanted to do something which would
be more proactive for the way...

98
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:17,475
...we introduce him,
because for most of the film...

99
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:20,186
...he's giving instructions
and giving orders.

100
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,188
This was the one moment
where we see...

101
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,565
...that he's willing to get
his hands dirty too.

102
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:27,401
And it was important to us
to kind of have this character.

103
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:29,695
Usually, in a gang film
or a gangster movie...

104
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,032
...the boss is this guy in a sort
of pristine suit, smoking a cigar.

105
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:36,994
I didn't want that, so I wanted him in
a vest with a sarong, eating noodles...

106
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:40,248
...and then shooting five people
in the back of the head.

107
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,083
The benefit of this role...

108
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:45,670
...is the fact that we had Ray Sahetapy
play the character to perfection.

109
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:49,173
He's really great
with understanding...

110
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,342
...that there was dark humor
to this scene.

111
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:53,469
He played it pitch-perfect then.

112
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,930
So I'm very happy with Ray
in this role as Tama.

113
00:05:55,931 --> 00:06:00,931
The idea, originally, wasn't supposed
to be five people being shot.

114
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:04,772
I'd written another scene where
it was supposed to be five people...

115
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:07,525
...stood on top of a plank of wood
in the atrium...

116
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:10,653
...and they were all supposed
to have nooses around their neck.

117
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,406
And the original idea
was to have them flipped off...

118
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:15,074
...and then, like, one by one,
they all fall down to the bottom.

119
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,826
...and then, like, one by one,
they all fall down to the bottom.

120
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:20,746
Number one would fall, his feet would
bounce before he hits the ground.

121
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,874
Number two the same,
three the same, four.

122
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,751
Then number five would kind
of drop down, but the rope...

123
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,213
...would be too slack and he'd hit
the ground, and crumple into pieces.

124
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:32,967
The punch line was Tama saying to
Mad Dog, "That rope's still too long."

125
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:35,928
That was the original idea,
but we didn't have the budget...

126
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,930
...or the capability to do that scene.

127
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,683
So then one afternoon...

128
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:43,519
...my sick brain started coming up
with different ideas...

129
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,938
...that we could create dark humor
out of that...

130
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,609
...so we decided to do the sort
of the gunshot execution...

131
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,111
...and then the bullets in the drawer.

132
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,364
And that kind of comes
more from, you know...

133
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,867
...the influence from Japanese cinema
that I have.

134
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,703
I've always been a big fan
of Japanese films.

135
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:02,496
Especially the sort of, you know...

136
00:07:02,497 --> 00:07:04,832
...the darker,
sort of black-comedy elements...

137
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:08,586
...that you get in films, like,
by Takeshi Kitano or Takashi Miike.

138
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:13,587
So those are the main influence points
for all the dark humor in this film.

139
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:20,014
I don't want to see any empty seats
on this truck when we're done.

140
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:24,769
Now let's clean up this fucking city.

141
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,440
This shot coming up here soon is--
it was a tricky shot that we had to do...

142
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:33,402
...because we did this about maybe
13 to 14 times before we got it right.

143
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:36,739
Because we start off
on a Pegasus crane.

144
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,159
We have to come down, but the
camera's hand-held, it's on a Fig Rig.

145
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,454
So I got my DOP sort of stretching out
over the end of the crane...

146
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:47,166
...and then once we get to the ground
here, you'll see a little tiny bump...

147
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,461
...and that's them unhooking him
from the wire to keep him safe.

148
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:53,130
We're able to kind
of come straight off that crane...

149
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:55,383
...and follow on entirely
in one shot...

150
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:58,261
...then, you know, track back along
with the conversation.

151
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:01,222
It's one of those frustrating moments
because of the setup.

152
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:05,559
Like, we couldn't actually monitor
the shot from an external monitor...

153
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,230
...so I had to kind of just wait and pray
and hope that the shot went well.

154
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,941
It was a case of waiting
until we finished the scene...

155
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:16,529
...and then get it in playback later on
to make sure it was good.

156
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,533
And a lot of potential fuck ups
by kids who aren't ready.

157
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:23,828
This isn't the most ideal
training ground, Jaka.

158
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:27,039
I'll keep them back.

159
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Further, much fucking further back.

160
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,424
In the SWAT team,
we have a number of--

161
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:39,719
We have a mix of people
who are kind of experienced actors...

162
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,387
...and less experienced actors.

163
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:44,015
Joe Taslim, that we see
looking up at the building...

164
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:47,018
...he's actually a national judo
champion for Indonesia.

165
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,730
And he's done like two, three movies
before this...

166
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:54,650
...but this was his first sort of, like,
you know, big role in a film, for us.

167
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,154
He-- The way he got the role was
he contacted me through Facebook...

168
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:01,407
...and said
that he really loved Merantau...

169
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,577
...and wanted to see if there
was anything we were doing next...

170
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,038
...and while I was looking
at his profile page...

171
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,499
...there was this one photograph of
him dressed in a SWAT team uniform.

172
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,127
And it was that thing--
I was looking for the face.

173
00:09:13,128 --> 00:09:17,173
Looking for the look of Jaka,
the character he plays, and he fit it.

174
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:19,300
And so I tend to have, like,
this thing...

175
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:22,511
...where I rely a lot on gut instinct
when it comes to casting...

176
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:25,431
...so I pursued the idea
of getting him in to come in...

177
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,350
...and we did two auditions with him.

178
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,393
The first audition
was a fight audition.

179
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:32,688
He came in did some choreography
with lko and with Yayan.

180
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,733
And then the second audition then
was purely drama-based then.

181
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:38,694
And we got very lucky
because he nailed both auditions.

182
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:41,447
We're very happy
with the work he's done on this film.

183
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,366
Like, he's proven himself...

184
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:46,786
...and hopefully he can kind of go on
to bigger and better things.

185
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:51,787
He's someone I definitely wanna work
with again at some point in the future.

186
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,212
Also in the cast here
is Verdi Solaiman.

187
00:09:56,213 --> 00:10:00,007
His father actually plays lko's father
at the start of the film as well.

188
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:02,968
And they have quite a strong
sort of acting family actually.

189
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,887
They're all performers.

190
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,680
And he's a great actor too.

191
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:09,558
Unfortunately,
he had this one monologue...

192
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,894
...which was in the beginning
of the film...

193
00:10:11,895 --> 00:10:14,397
...that we had to cut
for pacing issues.

194
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:16,148
But he's a great actor as well.

195
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:21,149
And, yeah, again, it was such a great
experience working with these guys.

196
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:27,701
One of the things I wanted to play
around with is the idea of shadows...

197
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,620
...and light in this film.

198
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:33,457
So we tend to do a lot with, you know,
things emerging out of the darkness.

199
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,293
We have another scene
where I'll come back to that...

200
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:38,129
...but for this one, I always--

201
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,715
We made sure in the grade that we
could crush out the background here...

202
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:45,094
...so that those hands of the SWAT
team do come out from the shadows.

203
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:47,680
We don't see any of the detail
except for the hands.

204
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:52,681
And I was really happy with the way
this kind of-- This scene turned out.

205
00:10:55,355 --> 00:11:00,355
B-3 clear.

206
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:02,695
Okay, let's move.

207
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,990
One of the things we did to prepare
the SWAT team for the shoot...

208
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,909
...is that we sent them
on a boot-camp training session...

209
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,122
...and we sent to KOPASKA, which is
like the Indonesian Navy SEALs.

210
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:15,124
We sent them there for a week
to 10 days.

211
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,585
And they did this extreme
boot-camp experience...

212
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:20,838
...where they got to learn how
to operate guns, how to, you know...

213
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,591
...use grenades
and specialists' strategy...

214
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:27,887
...and, you know, the tactics,
and they did raid simulations as well...

215
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,473
...and it was sort of--
it was like twofold.

216
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:33,726
We wanted to make sure that
whenever the guys were in the film...

217
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,437
...they felt like they knew
how to handle the weapons.

218
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:38,981
They felt like they belonged
as part of this unit...

219
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:42,318
...but further than that was to have
this idea of creating a sense...

220
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,738
...of brotherhood between them
that they could rely on each other.

221
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:48,908
And that was an important sort
of chemistry-building exercise...

222
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:53,162
...as much as anything else as well.

223
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:55,498
We're gonna introduce
another one of the actors.

224
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,666
Playing Gofar is lang Darmawan.

225
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:01,670
And he's actually from a comedy
group called Project P...

226
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,547
...based in Bandung, Indonesia.

227
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:05,925
And he's more known
for doing comedy sketches...

228
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,801
...and, you know, songs as well.

229
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,137
And so we--
When we cast him in this film...

230
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:13,432
...it was like a bit of a departure
for him to play a serious role.

231
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:17,937
There's moments where he has the
chance to show his comedy chops...

232
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:20,606
...and he kind of hits
those notes pitch-perfect again.

233
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,983
- This is bullshit.
- Listen.

234
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:24,276
You don't have much of a choice.

235
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,905
When we were casting for this film,
we knew we needed a lot of fighters.

236
00:12:27,906 --> 00:12:32,076
We needed a lot of extras,
and what we did was actually--

237
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:34,411
Before we went into production
on this film...

238
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:36,330
...we spent a year and a half
to get finance in place...

239
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:37,206
...we spent a year and a half
to get finance in place...

240
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:39,583
...to do a different film
called Berandal.

241
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,586
And we spent
about two or three months then...

242
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:44,838
...doing a huge casting call
for that film...

243
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,550
...where we searched for fighters
all over Indonesia.

244
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:51,303
We ended up having about maybe
2- to 300 people come into our office.

245
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,682
We whittled that down to about
80 to 90 people that could perform...

246
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:58,060
...that could actually do the fighting
that we required in the film.

247
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:01,105
So then when it came to actually start
working on this film...

248
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,857
...we knew that we had
that database of people...

249
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:06,402
...with different body heights,
different shapes...

250
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:08,320
...that we could use for this movie.

251
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:12,241
I wanna point out that this guy there
who just got flipped onto the table...

252
00:13:12,242 --> 00:13:15,077
...his name is Yandi
and he's one of the main members...

253
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:19,331
...of a stunt group that we used
in this film called Pyranha Stunts.

254
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,083
One of the other senior members...

255
00:13:21,084 --> 00:13:23,752
...is Eka, who plays Dagu,
one of the SWAT team members.

256
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:27,798
We get to see him throw down his
moves later on in the drugs-lab scene.

257
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:30,301
They came to us.
They worked with us on Merantau.

258
00:13:30,302 --> 00:13:32,344
They were key fighters in that film.

259
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,388
We gave them a bigger role
on this one...

260
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:39,389
...by having them work as the stunt
coordinators for us on this film.

261
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:45,145
Motherfucker!

262
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,666
Earlier, I told you how we kind
of struggled for like a year and a half...

263
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,627
...to get Berandal off the ground.

264
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:07,671
And what happened with that
was we were-- For Berandal...

265
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:10,799
...we were working on the basis
of having a much bigger budget.

266
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,844
It was a much larger film
in terms of scope and scale.

267
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:17,389
And we spent a long time just,
you know, in meetings with investors...

268
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,976
...time and time again, you know,
just being told, "No, no, no."

269
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:24,438
And the crux of it was that every time
we'd go in to talk to them...

270
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:27,232
...they'd be willing
to invest X amount into the film...

271
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:30,277
...only if it was the equivalent
of 50 percent of that budget.

272
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:31,945
Every time we talked to them...

273
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:35,074
...it was only 20 to 25 percent
of what we needed for Berandal.

274
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:38,661
That became the stumbling block
that stopped us from doing that film.

275
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,537
And so when it came to--

276
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:43,624
You know, after a year and a half
of not doing anything...

277
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:47,670
...and you'd be sat in the office and lko
started to gather dust on our shelves...

278
00:14:47,671 --> 00:14:51,507
...we decided we needed
to do a second film with him. And fast.

279
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:54,760
So I came up with the idea to do
The <i>Raid,</i> then, which was like--

280
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:58,055
Which was our plan B.
It was our backup project.

281
00:14:58,056 --> 00:15:01,809
Yeah, that became the thing whereby
we could go back to those investors...

282
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,019
...and say,
"This is a lower-budget project.

283
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,899
This is something we can do for,
you know, that SO-percent input."

284
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,027
And so then it was a case
of spending a year and a half...

285
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:15,739
...trying to get that first film made,
not being able to get the money up...

286
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,784
...and then all of a sudden,
we got the budget for The Raid...

287
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,203
...and we went straight
into production.

288
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,247
Police!

289
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:27,418
This scene was a little bit of a bone of
contention when we were creating it.

290
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,630
Because it's a-- Obviously, it's a very,
like, harsh moment in the film.

291
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,134
Killing a child in a film is always seen
as, like, a very strong...

292
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,720
...sort of no-no moment
in any kind of movie.

293
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:40,681
And what I wanted to do
was to have this moment in there...

294
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:43,308
...but sort of shoot it
in a respectful way...

295
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,562
...so that when we actually see
the impact of the gun--

296
00:15:46,563 --> 00:15:47,771
The bullet, sorry.

297
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,231
--It's soft focus.

298
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:52,276
We don't actually see the detail
of what happens to that kid.

299
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:54,194
And so we hint at it and we kind of--

300
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:57,072
It was more of a restrained way
of shooting the action.

301
00:15:57,073 --> 00:16:00,576
We have a little restraint when
it comes to the rest of the violence...

302
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:05,164
...but that was one moment where I felt
very strongly that we had to shoot it...

303
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:10,165
...and show that kind of scene with
a bit more respect of the audience too.

304
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:19,303
I'll talk a little bit about the locations
we used...

305
00:16:19,304 --> 00:16:22,097
...because we looked everywhere
throughout Jakarta...

306
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:25,267
...in order to find a real building
that we could use.

307
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:28,437
But our designs and our requirements
were so specific...

308
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:31,732
...that we were unable to find
a real building that we could use...

309
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:36,320
...so we ended up
doing a lot of studio work, so...

310
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,490
All of the corridors, like this stage,
the atrium...

311
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:41,950
...you know, Tama's office,
all of the rooms...

312
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:44,912
...and the stairwells,
they're all built in the studio.

313
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:48,624
The only thing that's actually real
is the sort of the big staircase...

314
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,960
...that they run up earlier on
in the film.

315
00:16:51,961 --> 00:16:56,924
And the drugs lab. The only other part,
in terms of the exterior of the building--

316
00:16:56,925 --> 00:16:59,968
The real building
was only four stories high...

317
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:04,473
...and it was a very clean, nice little
building with, like, offices inside it.

318
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:07,518
So my online guy would
sort of take that, use that template...

319
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,311
...and add an extra 10 to four--

320
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,731
Ten to 11 floors up
and just change the entire facade...

321
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:15,734
...so we made it look like this ominous,
you know, building.

322
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:19,738
We knew that the building would be
an important character in the film...

323
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,992
...so we looked at different ways that
we could kind of keep it interesting...

324
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:25,369
...on an aesthetic level.

325
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,413
Not to kind of--
Not to let the audience get bored...

326
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:32,376
...about the idea of going from corridor
to stairwell, from room to room.

327
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:34,253
So we worked hard to make sure...

328
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:37,089
...that every time we were
in one of these locations...

329
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,714
...that there was
a specific quality to it.

330
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:40,133
...that there was
a specific quality to it.

331
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:44,471
A specific set piece that set that
location aside from the rest of them.

332
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:47,683
And I'll come back to those later on
as the scenes unfold.

333
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:51,812
So there's a little bit of a back-story
about the music in this film...

334
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,857
...because obviously,
we have two versions.

335
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,442
What happened was,
when we sold the rights to Sony...

336
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,362
...we were in the middle
of production, actually.

337
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:02,197
I was two months into the shoot.

338
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:04,867
We sent some footage across
to the Cannes Film Market.

339
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:08,412
And luckily, Scott Shooman, who
was working with Sony at the time...

340
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:11,999
...he picked up the film
and got on the phone with me...

341
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,377
...and said, "You know,
we really wanna release this film...

342
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:19,047
...but would you be open to having
a new score done for the film?"

343
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:21,592
With somebody off their label.
And, yeah.

344
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:24,386
What happened was,
they hadn't heard the original yet...

345
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:28,599
...and we went ahead and continued
to make our film, make our version...

346
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,435
...using our musicians,
Fajar and Ogi.

347
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:34,897
They are the guys that worked
on the sound mix as well for the film...

348
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:38,483
...alongside Bonar, Sandika
and Jack.

349
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,945
And so, yeah.
I was so locked in with those guys...

350
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:45,824
...with the music we did on that film--
On the first version of the film.

351
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:49,995
--That when it came time to sort
of discuss it then with Mike and Joe...

352
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,706
...about their approach
doing the U.S. version...

353
00:18:52,707 --> 00:18:55,417
...I didn't wanna give them, you know,
specific notes.

354
00:18:55,418 --> 00:18:58,045
When I spoke on the phone
with Mike the first time...

355
00:18:58,046 --> 00:19:00,923
...I didn't wanna tell him,
"Let's go in this direction.

356
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:03,133
Here's your in point,
here's your out point."

357
00:19:03,134 --> 00:19:06,345
Because I was so wrapped
into that version that we'd done...

358
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:10,599
...that it just felt like I'd only be giving
him the same notes I gave my guys.

359
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,517
So I kind of said to Mike and Joe:

360
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,103
"You guys have
some creative freedom to go off...

361
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:19,483
...and do what you think is right, to
interpret the film the way you see fit."

362
00:19:19,484 --> 00:19:22,069
And that phone call helped.
It reassured me a lot.

363
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,113
Mike told me that his approach
was gonna be to take it...

364
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,991
...from more
of his classically trained background.

365
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:31,662
Not for it to be a bunch of songs,
which are plastered on top of a film...

366
00:19:31,663 --> 00:19:34,456
...but for it to actually be a score
that aids the film.

367
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:36,959
And when he was talking
about bringing in Joe...

368
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,794
...whose work I was a huge fan of...

369
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:42,422
...having, you know, loved
the whole work they did on TRON...

370
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:44,675
Yeah, it just-- It made sense then.

371
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:47,594
The idea of being told
they were gonna put songs in there...

372
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:50,597
...that would sit in the background
and just aid the scenes...

373
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:53,642
...and moments where they
were gonna lift it up even higher...

374
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:56,478
...make the music the forefront,
drive the scene forward.

375
00:19:56,479 --> 00:20:00,023
That balance between the two knowing
that it was gonna be score-based.

376
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:03,026
And talking about references
like John Carpenter films...

377
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,362
...and scores from the '80s,
these films I love.

378
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:08,740
Just, you know,
all the influences on this film.

379
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,493
It reassured me to the point
where I just had this--

380
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:13,996
Just a full confidence
in their ability then.

381
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:17,374
Belief that what they were gonna
do was gonna be right for the film.

382
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:22,375
Fifth floor secure.

383
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:31,763
So now we're gonna start to see
how we decided to kind of...

384
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,850
...create a scene where we could
play around with a location...

385
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:36,601
...and set it aside from the rest.

386
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:41,523
The atrium was always gonna be
about light and shadows, basically...

387
00:20:41,524 --> 00:20:45,610
...and once we hit the lights on this,
we were gonna play with that idea.

388
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:49,823
I wanted to explore different concepts
that I hadn't seen done in films before.

389
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:53,243
And so one of those is the idea
of when you look into the darkness...

390
00:20:53,244 --> 00:20:55,579
...the more you look,
the more detail you see.

391
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,914
The more things kind of appear
in the shadows.

392
00:20:57,915 --> 00:21:01,418
And once I kind of realized that
I hadn't seen that in a film before...

393
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:03,920
...it became the sort
of the driving force...

394
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:08,884
...behind designing this scene then,
and it was literally, like, one night...

395
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:11,219
...probably when I was trying
to go to sleep...

396
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,889
...trying to get some sleep,
about midnight or 1 a.m...

397
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,143
...then I get this idea for these guys
on different levels of different floors...

398
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,188
...who can't see each other,
there's not enough detail there.

399
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:23,815
They're looking in the shadows,
in the darkness.

400
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:27,027
And then I realized that we could
play around and heighten it...

401
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,946
...and do something
a little bit stylized...

402
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,742
...but something that made sense that
could convey to the audience that--

403
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:36,286
When that muzzle flash
of the shotgun goes off...

404
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,163
...that it would light up the space.

405
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:41,958
In the blink of that eye, these guys
with AK-47s were trained enough...

406
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:46,004
...knew enough to be able to pinpoint
their targets and then take them out.

407
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,508
That was something that developed
over the course of a night.

408
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:53,136
That probably kept me up till about
3, 4 a.m., writing notes all night.

409
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:55,722
And that's how it goes sometimes.

410
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:59,101
So this shot, then, with Tama,
speaking into the microphone...

411
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:04,102
...that was like a riff on a lot of different
influences that came into the film.

412
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:08,235
When we were making the film,
obviously, doing the film...

413
00:22:08,236 --> 00:22:11,154
...inside one location
and the idea of them being hunted...

414
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:14,908
...and being like, you know,
chased after by all these bad guys.

415
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,953
I watched a lot of films
that were classics of that sort of--

416
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:22,207
That sort of genre, that sort of style.
And so, you know, that initial--

417
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,293
That initial influence with
the microphone shot was...

418
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:27,087
...something that was, you know--

419
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:30,048
Came from, like, The Warriors,
by Walter Hill.

420
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:33,301
Throughout the course of
preproduction and designing the film...

421
00:22:33,302 --> 00:22:35,846
...writing the script,
I would watch a lot of films.

422
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:39,975
<i>So I'd</i> be <i>checking out Die Hard,
Escape from New York.</i>

423
00:22:39,976 --> 00:22:42,936
<i>Assault on Precinct 13
was</i> a <i>big influence.</i>

424
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:45,647
And what I kind of took from those
films, like, especially with Die Hard...

425
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,482
And what I kind of took from those
films, like, especially with Die Hard...

426
00:22:47,483 --> 00:22:51,486
...was the idea of how to create these
big, bombastic spectacle scenes...

427
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:53,697
...these big action set pieces.

428
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:55,323
But then-- Mix in that, then...

429
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,993
...with the sort
of more lower-budget scale...

430
00:22:57,994 --> 00:22:59,661
...of <i>Assault on Precinct</i> 13...

431
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:03,832
...and figuring out ways that we
could create this sense of danger...

432
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,042
...and, you know,
people coming at them...

433
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:08,170
...from every corner of every room...

434
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:12,048
...but without having, you know,
hundreds of extras at my disposal.

435
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:15,719
<i>So the</i> thing I <i>got most from Assault
on Precinct 13 was the use of sound...</i>

436
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,388
...and the use of building up
tension and dread...

437
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:20,974
...and trying to kind of create
this atmosphere...

438
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:23,226
...of, you know,
what's around every corner.

439
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:25,979
And I think the moment
that clicked for me...

440
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,482
...was when I realized early on
in the scripting process...

441
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:34,483
...that the concept was technically
a survival horror film.

442
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:37,949
You know, the--
On the surface level...

443
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,494
...people will kind of always see it
as a martial-arts action film...

444
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:44,164
...but for me,
it was always a survival horror...

445
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:47,542
...that happened to have martial arts
as the action discipline in it.

446
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:51,546
So once I kind of realized that, I was
able to add a lot more detail in there...

447
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:54,758
...and add a lot more sort of,
you know...

448
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,593
...elements from different genres...

449
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:59,429
...that don't normally exist
in a martial-arts film.

450
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,641
I'm gonna talk a little bit
about this shot while it's still on.

451
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,310
We wanted to do this shot,
and we wanted it to feel...

452
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:10,106
...like 1000 frames per second with the
shotgun shell coming out of the front...

453
00:24:10,107 --> 00:24:12,400
...and the fire lighting up
the guy's face.

454
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:15,695
We didn't have the budget to have
an expensive camera to do that...

455
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:18,990
...so, what we did was we just shot
in 60 frames per second...

456
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,243
...and just had
the actor move slowly.

457
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:26,244
So he looked like an idiot and a dick
for about five to 10 takes of the shot.

458
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:29,042
I told him, "You're gonna look
like a fool. Trust me.

459
00:24:29,043 --> 00:24:31,044
When we get it right, it'll look great."

460
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:35,382
And thankfully, a combination
of the slo-mo and his acting...

461
00:24:35,383 --> 00:24:38,260
...mixed with the great CG work
by Andi...

462
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:40,512
...that's worked with us
on two films now...

463
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:44,224
...makes our shot work
completely then.

464
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:45,976
I'll talk a bit about the guns...

465
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:50,772
...because we didn't have real
blank-firing guns at all in this shoot.

466
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:53,316
We used airsoft blowback guns.

467
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:55,944
So nothing was coming out
of the guns at all and it--

468
00:24:55,945 --> 00:24:58,071
What worked for us
in terms of that...

469
00:24:58,072 --> 00:25:00,448
...was we could shoot
and shoot and shoot...

470
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,450
...and reset time
would be immediate.

471
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,703
There was no need
to go through the whole--

472
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:07,205
Sort of the safety processes
you'd go through...

473
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:10,542
...if you were using blank-firing guns
and blank-firing bullets.

474
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:14,671
So it meant that we had a lot
of CG elements also then.

475
00:25:14,672 --> 00:25:17,215
It was postproduction heavy
in terms of that.

476
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:19,718
But one of the things
that we had to do--

477
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:22,387
This situation,
this scene was in the darkness.

478
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:25,515
--Was we had to have real light
bounce around off the walls...

479
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:27,100
...and bounce off the weapons.

480
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:30,478
We came up with a cheap, low-budget
technique where we had--

481
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:34,607
Our Art Department would use
welding guns to create a spark...

482
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,276
...we'd use diffusion sheets...

483
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:39,070
...then we'd have about three
or four of those set up.

484
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,156
Whenever we'd be ready
for the gunfire...

485
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:43,700
...we'd count them down,
like one, two, three...

486
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:45,744
...and the guys would fire
their guns.

487
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:47,704
Other guys
would be setting off sparks.

488
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:50,790
It would create
this working environment that--

489
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:54,085
Where my online guy could be able
to put in the muzzle flashes...

490
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,046
...and the bullet shells later.

491
00:25:56,047 --> 00:25:59,674
And I got him right where I want him.

492
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:03,595
So I should probably mention about
Doni Alamsyah and Yayan Ruhian...

493
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,348
...who play Tama's right-hand men.

494
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:10,977
Doni actually has played lko's
brother twice now in two films for us.

495
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:12,896
He played his brother in Merantau.

496
00:26:12,897 --> 00:26:15,023
In Merantau,
it was a much smaller role...

497
00:26:15,024 --> 00:26:17,525
...and he came to us after Merantau
and said how--

498
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:20,570
Like he kind of regretted
not being able to do any fighting...

499
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:23,239
...and not being able to do action
in the first movie.

500
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,533
And so when it came time
to set up The Raid...

501
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:27,369
...I wanted him to play this role...

502
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,746
...and he was hungry for it,
and he came in.

503
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:32,540
And, yeah, he did a great job
in this role.

504
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:34,542
Yayan was actually--

505
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:38,380
Who plays Mad Dog, is one of the
choreography team from Merantau.

506
00:26:38,381 --> 00:26:42,008
And for him, then, in this film,
like, he--

507
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:43,802
When we were
setting up Merantau...

508
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:46,930
...we weren't initially going
to cast him as Eric in that film.

509
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:50,392
But after practicing
all the choreography with lko...

510
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:53,645
...for months on end and not finding
a person to play that role...

511
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:57,399
...Anne suggested that we should give
him a try and give him an audition.

512
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,859
When he came in to do the audition,
he nailed it.

513
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,321
So he was just as good on the drama
as he was with the fighting.

514
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:06,950
And so when it came to The <i>Raid,</i>
I knew I wanted to cast him again...

515
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:10,078
...and give him a challenging role
because Mad Dog is kind of--

516
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,790
In Merantau, when we cast him
as Eric, he had a redeemable quality.

517
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:15,500
This one, he was just pure evil.

518
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:18,002
I think Yayan actually relished
the opportunity...

519
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:23,003
...to play a character that bad,
that vicious then.

520
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:26,594
When I'm working
on martial-arts sequences...

521
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:30,265
...I shoot with a very detailed
video storyboard.

522
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:32,934
We work out every angle
and every edit ahead of time.

523
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:36,146
This is in, like, the first three months'
worth of preproduction.

524
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:39,023
But for all the gunplay stuff,
like we're seeing now...

525
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,986
...I shot this without a shot list at all.
We didn't have any kind of storyboard.

526
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:47,490
So the way we did it was we'd do a lot
of long takes, where we tell the actors:

527
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:51,077
"You're bursting through the door,
you arrest that guy. Pick up that sofa.

528
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:53,580
Pick up the wardrobe,
put it in front of the door."

529
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:55,457
We'd give them
these longer takes...

530
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:58,751
...so they could get an energy going
and a real feel for the scene.

531
00:27:58,752 --> 00:28:01,463
And then I'd sort of orchestrate
my two cameras then...

532
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:04,299
...to kind of pick up different elements
of that scene...

533
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,302
...as we were going through it
take by take by take.

534
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:09,762
The benefit, I guess,
of being my own editor...

535
00:28:09,763 --> 00:28:11,806
...is whenever we're doing
these shots...

536
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:14,934
...I know where the in and out points
are for everything we do.

537
00:28:14,935 --> 00:28:17,854
So I can kind of almost be able
to conduct them...

538
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:20,857
...and tell them, "Come down low
for the guy's close-up.

539
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:24,068
As soon as they've arrested him,
go up to the cupboard."

540
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,906
And, yeah. That worked for us
in this scene and it was a bit of a--

541
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:30,033
An experiment
and we were a bit nervous...

542
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:32,577
...but after about a day or two,
we found a flow...

543
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,955
...and we were comfortable
to kind of finish this scene off then...

544
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:40,168
...without having the need
to have a full, detailed shot list.

545
00:28:40,169 --> 00:28:44,005
One of the decisions when it came to
designing how we were gonna shoot...

546
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:48,676
...was that feeling that we wanted it to
be almost semi-documentary in style.

547
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:51,179
So once we're sort of
with that SWAT team...

548
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,765
...we follow them
and discover everything with them.

549
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:55,517
We're over their shoulder.

550
00:28:55,518 --> 00:28:58,394
Whenever we're with them,
it's got a hand-held feel to it.

551
00:28:58,395 --> 00:29:00,772
Like this shot,
we have to go through the hole.

552
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,650
It was one of those things.
To make that transition work...

553
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:06,277
...we wanted to follow lko
as he jumps through.

554
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:11,278
And the way we did that shot, actually,
was we had two camera guys...

555
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:16,287
...and we had the one up on top of the
top floor with the camera on a Fig Rig.

556
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:18,706
And as lko would drop down
through the hole...

557
00:29:18,707 --> 00:29:22,418
...he would fall down with him, push
half of his body through the hole...

558
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:24,045
...and twist the camera around.

559
00:29:24,046 --> 00:29:27,549
Meanwhile, we got a second camera
guy then, down on the bottom floor...

560
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,968
...stood on a table,
waiting for the camera.

561
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,220
When it drops through,
he takes hold of it...

562
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:34,389
...controls camera,
continues the movement.

563
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:37,642
So it was like a-- It was a cool, like,
low-budget DIY thing...

564
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,103
...that we did in order to sort of--

565
00:29:40,104 --> 00:29:43,314
Yeah. In order to achieve
what we wanted to achieve with the--

566
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:46,609
Sort of the camera movement
and style.

567
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,610
Bowo, the ax!

568
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:55,326
I'm happy
with the way this scene turned out.

569
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,580
We have, like, a lot of mayhem
and chaos from--

570
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:01,583
With attacks coming from every
possible place inside the room.

571
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:05,795
But one of the things I'm happy with is
how we did the sound design on this...

572
00:30:05,796 --> 00:30:07,714
...with Fajar and Ogi's work on...

573
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:10,425
...having this moment
where the sound just drops.

574
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:13,970
And the reason why we did this,
this idea of experiencing...

575
00:30:13,971 --> 00:30:17,432
...the deafness of Bowo's character
when he gets hit in the ear...

576
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:20,268
...is that we wanted to have a respite
for the audience...

577
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:23,855
...because we have such a sort of
relentless gunfire scene...

578
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:26,107
...which has gone on
for a minute or two...

579
00:30:26,108 --> 00:30:29,777
...that I wanted there to be one
moment where we take a breath...

580
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:34,778
...and then go back into it as soon
as Rama pulls out the gas canister.

581
00:30:37,077 --> 00:30:41,539
This idea-- Again, this is one of those,
like, <i>2</i> a.m., trying to sleep...

582
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,876
...and then suddenly
something pops in my head.

583
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:48,463
So I was starting to think about
how I could kind of end the scene...

584
00:30:48,464 --> 00:30:53,009
...not knowing what I should do with it,
and I wanted to finish on an explosion.

585
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:55,470
And in Indonesia,
in a lot of our ovens...

586
00:30:55,471 --> 00:30:57,889
...we have these big gas canisters
underneath...

587
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,933
...and so maybe it was one
of those very rare days...

588
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:04,187
...when I was cooking for a change,
and I saw that gas canister...

589
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:07,231
...and I thought, "That would make
a good combustible device."

590
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,943
And trying to figure out how we could
channel that out through a doorway...

591
00:31:10,944 --> 00:31:13,613
...putting it in a refrigerator
seemed to make sense...

592
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:18,493
...and seemed to be, like,
a logical solution for it.

593
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:20,536
When we discussed the idea...

594
00:31:20,537 --> 00:31:24,582
...of whether that would work,
like, on a sort of, like, a realistic way...

595
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,959
...I spoke to our military adviser
and said:

596
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,379
"if I put a gas canister
inside a refrigerator...

597
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,799
...and then threw a flash-bang grenade
in there, would that be enough?

598
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,010
Would the charge of that be enough
to create an explosion?"

599
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:40,848
And he told me yes.
So I guess I've learned something...

600
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:43,309
...by watching lots of violent movies
in the '80s.

601
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,605
They can cover the damage.

602
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:52,606
Both of you get down there.
I want this situation under control.

603
00:31:56,156 --> 00:31:57,949
Yes, boss.

604
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,369
One of the things that's been
kind of said about this movie a lot...

605
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,622
...is that it's got a similar structure
to that of a video game.

606
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:09,043
Usually a lot of people, when they get
told that they take it as an offense...

607
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,879
...but for me, I actually take that
as a huge compliment.

608
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,881
Because we did--
We set it up like this.

609
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:15,925
We set up, you know, the villains...

610
00:32:15,926 --> 00:32:20,346
...to have this sort of almost-- They're
the next step up, the next stage up.

611
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:24,142
Yandi, the guy we saw earlier pulling
the machete from under the table...

612
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,893
...we set him up to be this guy...

613
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:28,980
...who's going to play a major part
in the action.

614
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:33,067
But then through introducing,
like, the new challenger...

615
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:36,446
...we kind of kill him off
by showing the machete gang.

616
00:32:36,447 --> 00:32:39,866
So the leader of the machete gang
is played by a guy called Godfred...

617
00:32:39,867 --> 00:32:43,369
...and he was found
by our casting girl on Berandal, lcha.

618
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,830
She found him on a trip
outside of Jakarta.

619
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,749
She found him on a trip
outside of Jakarta.

620
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,085
And in his real life
he's actually an architect...

621
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:53,087
...and he's a really, really nice guy.

622
00:32:53,088 --> 00:32:56,007
He happens to be capable
of beating the shit out of people.

623
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:58,509
So, yeah,
he was a real great find for us.

624
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,345
And, you know, like,
same with Joe...

625
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:05,558
...the same with, you know, Yayan
and lko, throughout my last two films.

626
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,685
Sometimes you stumble
upon these people...

627
00:33:07,686 --> 00:33:11,230
...that seem like they were, you
know, born to do this type of thing...

628
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:16,231
...born to be in films, but they
just never had the chance before.

629
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,001
One of the things we wanted to do...

630
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:35,755
...was to have a logical reason
why we get to the martial arts.

631
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:38,883
So for the first 30 minutes
of the film...

632
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,260
...we kind of stick
to a lot of gunplay action.

633
00:33:41,261 --> 00:33:44,305
And we do that on purpose
because, like, I don't like--

634
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:46,849
I knew the film was gonna be
a martial-arts film...

635
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,937
...but I don't like seeing films where
guys have an arsenal of weapons...

636
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:54,982
...but they choose to use their fists,
they choose to use their feet.

637
00:33:54,983 --> 00:33:57,777
This is a SWAT team
that have gone into this building...

638
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:00,822
...so we couldn't have them
realistically use any weapons...

639
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:03,866
...or hand-to-hand fighting
until they'd run out of bullets...

640
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:07,078
...until they had no option left,
until they had no choice left.

641
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:10,331
And so this was one of those things
where we had to figure out...

642
00:34:10,332 --> 00:34:15,332
...logistically, how we could get rid of
their equipment step by step by step.

643
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:18,673
So it was a case of,
"Okay, we need to lose their guns...

644
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:21,300
...we need to lose their helmets,
lose their gloves."

645
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:26,301
it was just finding these little moments
throughout where we could do that.

646
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,102
I'm gonna spoil something
for you now.

647
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,437
When we were shooting this,
this was like...

648
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:37,859
...our schedule was all over the place.
And that guy being carried...

649
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,319
...that's not Pierre Gruno,
who played Wahyu.

650
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,155
That's a stand-in we had
who came in just for that day.

651
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:48,156
So poor guy ended up being brought
in, had his hair sprayed gray by us...

652
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:51,080
...and then was just bundled
across to a doorway.

653
00:34:51,081 --> 00:34:56,081
And that was it. That was his day.

654
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,555
A lot of this we shot low-budget.
That last shot then...

655
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:10,683
...with the guys climbing up
through the hole in the floor...

656
00:35:10,684 --> 00:35:14,520
...I wasn't given the same kind
of treatment as I was on Merantau.

657
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:18,357
On Merantau, producers spoiled me.
It was one of those things where...

658
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,361
...any time I wanted a piece of rigging,
piece of equipment, it was on standby.

659
00:35:22,362 --> 00:35:25,406
Every day of the shoot,
I could have whatever I wanted to.

660
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:28,492
On this it was like, "You've got
seven days to have rigging...

661
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:31,579
...and you're not allowed
to have more than one equipment."

662
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,916
So, like, doing shots like that
where we needed to be high up...

663
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:37,501
...it was one of those things
where we discuss it:

664
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,378
"We don't wanna
spend our money...

665
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:42,757
...to get a crane for that type of shot
or to get that extra height."

666
00:35:42,758 --> 00:35:47,094
So it was literally just stand on the
table, hand-held, and just, you know...

667
00:35:47,095 --> 00:35:50,598
...just do what we did when we
were making independent films...

668
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,267
...and use those tricks and techniques
that we had...

669
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:58,268
...to figure out, like, how to kind of
raise the production value on this film.

670
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:02,485
Earlier I was talking about
the idea of survival horror...

671
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:05,780
...as the central concept, and this
is one of those key moments...

672
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:09,283
...where we started to inject
horror elements into the film.

673
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:12,703
The idea of him, you know,
tapping that machete on the tiles...

674
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:16,082
...this is clearly sort of,
you know, inspired by...

675
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:19,085
...all the horror films
I watched as a child growing up.

676
00:36:19,086 --> 00:36:21,253
It's one of those things
where I wanted...

677
00:36:21,254 --> 00:36:24,840
...to play on this whole idea
of, like, claustrophobia...

678
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:28,386
...and the idea of being stuck
with nowhere to go...

679
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,388
...being stuck with no escape and--

680
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:34,558
Yeah, this was the best way
that we could kind of convey it then.

681
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,062
This I use whenever people talk
about the idea of making films...

682
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,272
...as being this glamorous thing...

683
00:36:40,273 --> 00:36:45,236
...where, you know, you have, like, big
stars and beautiful shooting locations.

684
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:49,115
Yeah, three men
in a dirty, danky toilet...

685
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:53,411
...in the middle of a rundown building
in Jakarta, it's not glamorous at all.

686
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:56,455
When you think that we have
lighting guys and sound guys...

687
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:59,458
...and then also, like, a camera
inside that space...

688
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:04,459
...yeah, it's not quite
as you kind of imagine it.

689
00:37:10,345 --> 00:37:12,638
Initially, this was supposed
to be a scene...

690
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,433
...we were gonna split up
into two or three sections...

691
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:19,061
...and we were gonna intercut it
with the fight in the hallway.

692
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,772
But after I kind of showed it
to Todd Brown...

693
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,192
...one of the exec-producers
of the film, runs Twitch Film website...

694
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:27,528
...he gave me advice.
He said, "You know what?

695
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:30,948
The fighting in the hallway plays
so much better as one entire fight."

696
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:33,409
If we kept breaking it up
and shifting gears...

697
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:35,911
...and, you know, going back
to that, you know...

698
00:37:35,912 --> 00:37:39,206
...more tension building in the toilet,
it would kill both scenes.

699
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:43,627
And so very rightly, like, he told me
to treat them as two separate scenes...

700
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:48,628
...and just to kind of come back
to that toilet at the end of this fight.

701
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,595
- Don't fucking leave me with that guy.
- He's not one of them.

702
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:56,599
So when we designed the fight scenes
for all of our films...

703
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,394
...what usually happened
is that I'll give lko and Yayan...

704
00:38:00,395 --> 00:38:05,357
...an idea of the location, the props,
sort of the general setup of a scene...

705
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,820
...and then they'll kind of figure out
the sort of the technical stuff then.

706
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:12,448
They have to fight their way
out of those situations.

707
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:16,327
When it comes to the script, the detail
we have on the script is saying that:

708
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,997
"Okay, so lko's character has a stick
and a knife. Those are his weapons.

709
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,541
He also has Bowo
sort of clinging to his shoulder.

710
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:25,920
So we have this moment where,
at the start of the fight at least...

711
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:30,921
...he has to maintain Bowo's balance
because Bowo can't stand on his feet."

712
00:38:31,384 --> 00:38:34,178
And then the script is--
You know, you can't put...

713
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,181
...the punches, kicks, hits
into the detail of the script...

714
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:41,102
...because no one's gonna understand
that except for you as the writer.

715
00:38:41,103 --> 00:38:43,562
And so I kind of keep it more
to bullet points.

716
00:38:43,563 --> 00:38:45,940
So we have the moment
where he puts Bowo down...

717
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:49,652
...we have the moment where he loses
a stick, when he loses a knife, and...

718
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:52,988
Like, that kind of informs
the choreography then, in terms of:

719
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:57,989
"Okay, so we can explore
different aspects of fight design."

720
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:06,460
This would probably be my mother's
favorite scene in the entire film.

721
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:10,798
She has a problem with anything
to do with knife violence in movies.

722
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:12,591
She can't stand knives in films.

723
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:17,138
So as you can imagine,
this shot coming up right here.

724
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:19,348
Yeah, she loved that one, so...

725
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:21,559
You're welcome, Morn.

726
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,478
So when we're designing
these fight scenes...

727
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:28,774
...obviously, we need to kind of be
able to have different elements...

728
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:32,528
...from the Art Department, and for,
like, certain parts of the location...

729
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:35,072
...that need to be protective
for the stunt guys...

730
00:39:35,073 --> 00:39:40,073
...whenever they come into contact
with walls or doors or light fixtures.

731
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,372
And you'll see one of the
best examples of that coming up.

732
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:46,959
We design, like, a miniature version
of the set in preproduction...

733
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,712
...to map out
where the choreography takes place.

734
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:54,216
So at this point we know exactly
that this column and this wall...

735
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:57,052
...needs to be cushioned
and needs to be soft.

736
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:59,221
The way we did that
was we kind of...

737
00:39:59,222 --> 00:40:02,933
...we Sellotaped a bunch of blood
bags to the side of the guy's head.

738
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:07,396
All of those tiles are made out of foam
and the wood is made out of rubber.

739
00:40:07,397 --> 00:40:11,734
So when we sort of smashed his head
along down there, the tiles crack...

740
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:14,445
...blood from the blood bags
strapped to his head...

741
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:18,949
...they're leaving the mark on the tiles.
You feel you're seeing something real.

742
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,493
And combined
with the sort of sound effects then...

743
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,913
...it has exactly the desired effect.

744
00:40:23,914 --> 00:40:25,831
It gets laughs from the audience.

745
00:40:25,832 --> 00:40:29,919
So maybe a lot of you guys, you know,
are just as sick as me then outside.

746
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,713
In this scene we have a combination
of different things.

747
00:40:32,714 --> 00:40:36,467
Whenever we can do it, we tend to use
practical blood as often as possible...

748
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:40,679
...but every now and then
we'll have, like, Andi, our online guy...

749
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,599
...sort of aid us
and do a lot of CG blood.

750
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,186
So then that gunfire then,
we had, like, a real explosion...

751
00:40:47,187 --> 00:40:50,981
...for the door frame,
for when the door splinters.

752
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,692
But then the blood that hits the wall,
that was all CG.

753
00:40:53,693 --> 00:40:58,364
And Andi, our online guy, is really,
really good at doing CG blood.

754
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:02,243
He-- His attention to detail
is something that makes the blood...

755
00:41:02,244 --> 00:41:05,287
...work so well in this film
that I feel, you know.

756
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:08,582
The main reason why
is because he pays attention...

757
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:12,086
...to where the light sources are
in all of the locations as well.

758
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:15,589
So he looks for where those shadows
are and where the light spots are...

759
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,716
...so that whenever that blood
comes out...

760
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:21,262
...it's reacting to the atmosphere
on set...

761
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:24,932
...not just the idea of just
painting blood onto an image then.

762
00:41:24,933 --> 00:41:29,144
That level of detail is one of
the reasons why we work with Andi...

763
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:34,145
...and, you know, look forward
to working with him again and again.

764
00:41:34,943 --> 00:41:37,569
Open the door!

765
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,155
So now, like I said earlier
about that idea...

766
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:42,783
...of going from set piece
and then, you know--

767
00:41:42,784 --> 00:41:47,454
Once we end on one big set piece,
like, a sort of an explosive moment...

768
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:50,124
...it was the idea
of keeping that pace going...

769
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:52,626
...keeping the idea
of this relentless feeling...

770
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:55,421
...of the story and the plot
always driving forward.

771
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:58,215
And I had to almost immediately
jump into this moment...

772
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:01,593
...where we start to build tension,
and we start to build suspense.

773
00:42:01,594 --> 00:42:06,348
So this is one of those scenes where
I'm kind of probably most proud of...

774
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:10,894
...how we kind of built the tension
and the suspense in this moment.

775
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,271
Open the door.

776
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,315
Please.

777
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:16,734
You can't turn your back on us.

778
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:19,069
Now open the door.

779
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,070
One of the things that I have
is kind of a-- Not so much a phobia...

780
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:28,329
...but I feel very uncomfortable with,
is that idea of claustrophobia.

781
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,248
And that idea of,
not just claustrophobia...

782
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:34,376
...but being trapped in a position
where you cannot escape.

783
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:37,129
We did it on a smaller scale
earlier with the toilet...

784
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:37,838
...but this is that same situation,
but in a much more extreme way...

785
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,758
...but this is that same situation,
but in a much more extreme way...

786
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:44,345
...when they get to hide
inside the wall, and...

787
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:49,346
It's just that whole concept
of they literally have nowhere to go.

788
00:42:49,476 --> 00:42:53,687
If Godfred finds that door panel
and opens that wall...

789
00:42:53,688 --> 00:42:56,440
...they're stuck, they're dead.
Can't escape from that.

790
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,984
And that was something
that kind of--

791
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:02,196
When I was coming up
with the idea for this then, it just--

792
00:43:02,197 --> 00:43:07,159
Again, it was all-- It's all coming
from my love of the horror genre...

793
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,244
...my love of, like, thriller movies.

794
00:43:09,245 --> 00:43:13,874
And truth be told, one of the influences
is that idea of when I was a kid...

795
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:17,086
...I was terrified of the music video
for "Thriller."

796
00:43:17,087 --> 00:43:20,339
And there's a moment when,
you know, she's in that room...

797
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,966
...and zombies come breaking in
through the walls...

798
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:27,054
...and that stuck with me all the way
throughout my childhood. I hated it.

799
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:29,348
So this was kind of like a riff
on that then.

800
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:33,227
It was that idea of,
you know, they're stuck.

801
00:43:33,228 --> 00:43:36,397
And as soon as Godfred sort of,
like, realizes...

802
00:43:36,398 --> 00:43:38,482
...that something's up
with this wall...

803
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:42,611
...it sets that idea in the audience's
mind, "What is gonna happen next?"

804
00:43:42,612 --> 00:43:45,489
And even though
he doesn't pop open that panel...

805
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,076
...you could argue that what actually
does happen is probably just as bad.

806
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:52,996
- You hiding anyone here, friend?
- No, I swear it.

807
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,207
You wouldn't be lying
to me now, would you?

808
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:57,709
This scene is really interesting.

809
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,131
This scene plays differently
in different countries and audiences.

810
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:05,217
In Indonesia, they laugh so much...

811
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:07,553
...at the dialogue here
when we do this scene...

812
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:11,265
...because there's something about
Godfred's accent and his delivery...

813
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:14,476
...that for some reason people
in Indonesia just crack up at it...

814
00:44:14,477 --> 00:44:17,771
...whereas in, when we screen it
in the U.K. or in the U.S...

815
00:44:17,772 --> 00:44:21,567
...people tend to stay serious about it.
They see it as a genuine threat.

816
00:44:21,568 --> 00:44:23,944
But when it comes
to the Indonesian audience...

817
00:44:23,945 --> 00:44:26,196
...once he says:

818
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:28,991
It's like it's seen
as this humorous thing.

819
00:44:28,992 --> 00:44:33,287
So, yeah, it's kind of weird to kind of
see a film play completely differently...

820
00:44:33,288 --> 00:44:36,290
...with different audiences
and the way they respond.

821
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,459
But to be honest,
from my side of things...

822
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,836
...it doesn't matter
which way the response is.

823
00:44:40,837 --> 00:44:44,423
If there's a response and people
are enjoying it, then it works.

824
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:49,424
So, yeah.
Laugh or take it seriously. Go ahead.

825
00:45:11,659 --> 00:45:14,161
This tends to get a reaction.
When we watch this...

826
00:45:14,162 --> 00:45:18,582
...this one tends to be one of those
where people kind of respond big.

827
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:22,377
When we played this film in festivals,
the first time we played it...

828
00:45:22,378 --> 00:45:24,963
...was in the Toronto International
Film Festival.

829
00:45:24,964 --> 00:45:27,674
It was part
of the Midnight Madness section.

830
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:30,844
And we'd finished postproduction
on this film...

831
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:33,013
...literally one week
before the screening.

832
00:45:33,014 --> 00:45:38,014
And me and my producer,
at that point, we were so...

833
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:42,439
We were so pessimistic about the film.
All we could see were the problems.

834
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,443
All we could see were the sort of areas
of picture break-up in the corner...

835
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:50,614
...or bits of sound that dropped that we
wished we could fix, and you know...

836
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,991
We had no expectations going in.

837
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:55,494
And when it came
to that actual first screening...

838
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:58,330
...all we hoped for
was a couple of decent poster quotes.

839
00:45:58,331 --> 00:45:59,706
That was all we expected.

840
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:02,626
That was the sort of height
of our expectation on the film.

841
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:07,214
And then when it started to play,
like, the Midnight Madness audience...

842
00:46:07,215 --> 00:46:10,509
...they just took to it, and they just
heightened the experience...

843
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:13,637
...and just elevated the film
to a point where we were--

844
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:17,266
Me and lko and Joe were there,
we went along for the screening...

845
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,226
...and we were blown away.

846
00:46:19,227 --> 00:46:22,813
Like, we were so overwhelmed
by the experience of it and...

847
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:25,482
Yeah, ever since then--
And to be able to sit in...

848
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:28,277
...and get the audience's reactions
as they, you know...

849
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:32,781
...ooh and aah and sort of vocalize
how they feel during the film...

850
00:46:32,782 --> 00:46:34,783
...it's the best feeling as a director.

851
00:46:34,784 --> 00:46:38,120
It's the best feeling in the world
to know that those little ideas...

852
00:46:38,121 --> 00:46:43,121
...and those little beats connect
with an audience in some way.

853
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:48,547
So this is probably the example--

854
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:50,632
I was talking to you earlier
about lang...

855
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:55,633
...the guy that plays Gofar,
of his sort of, like, comic timing.

856
00:46:56,264 --> 00:47:00,475
The situation is pretty grim. The idea
of having to kind of do this operation...

857
00:47:00,476 --> 00:47:04,688
...but I wanted to play it for a certain,
like, dark humor to it as well.

858
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:09,689
And so when it came
to that idea of needing a knife...

859
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:14,823
...that he brings back a butter knife,
it's the worst thing he could find...

860
00:47:14,824 --> 00:47:17,743
...the way he plays it,
plays it completely straight.

861
00:47:17,744 --> 00:47:20,203
He asks him if a spoon
or chopsticks would work.

862
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:24,416
Whenever we were doing rehearsals,
he cracked me up every single time.

863
00:47:24,417 --> 00:47:28,086
And so it's kind of reassuring to know
that it works with all audiences.

864
00:47:28,087 --> 00:47:31,465
This has been one of those things
where it's worked universally.

865
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:33,383
People seem to find it funny, so...

866
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:37,387
I'm glad that people share the same
twisted sense of humor as me, then.

867
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,682
Maybe I can comment on the makeup.
The makeup is done by Jerry...

868
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:45,646
...and for this entire sequence,
that's all practical.

869
00:47:45,647 --> 00:47:48,649
So we had like a latex effect then...

870
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:52,527
...where we could build up his
stomach, so we could get that depth...

871
00:47:52,528 --> 00:47:55,906
...so when lko put the butter knife
inside, that we could actually...

872
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:59,618
...feel like it's gone really deep
inside the guy's stomach, so, yeah.

873
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:03,205
Thanks to Jerry
for that amazing piece of effect.

874
00:48:03,206 --> 00:48:06,291
This scene in the elevator,
this is actually--

875
00:48:06,292 --> 00:48:10,504
It was just sort of another one of those,
like, bone-of-contention moments.

876
00:48:10,505 --> 00:48:15,300
This was something I was considering
cutting from the film for a long time...

877
00:48:15,301 --> 00:48:19,388
...and it wasn't until maybe
the last final two or three days of--

878
00:48:19,389 --> 00:48:24,309
Before we reached picture lock,
we decided to keep it and leave it in.

879
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,645
In terms of plot importance--

880
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:30,440
Yes, it kind of hints at, you know,
the fact that there's something more...

881
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:34,444
...to Andi's character, in terms
of, you know, what his intentions are.

882
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:38,573
But for me, when I watched this film
with an audience now...

883
00:48:38,574 --> 00:48:42,661
...I feel like tonally
it doesn't quite fit right yet.

884
00:48:42,662 --> 00:48:45,038
We've just had
such a strong visceral moment...

885
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,375
...and such a strong extreme scene
of violence before this...

886
00:48:48,376 --> 00:48:49,876
...with the hallway fight, you know,
the machete through the wall...

887
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:51,837
...with the hallway fight, you know,
the machete through the wall...

888
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:54,256
...and then the operation on Bowo...

889
00:48:54,257 --> 00:48:58,093
...that for me, whenever I watch this,
every time it comes to that elevator...

890
00:48:58,094 --> 00:49:00,804
...I feel like we still need
another scene of respite.

891
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:02,973
Need another moment
where we can breathe...

892
00:49:02,974 --> 00:49:04,975
...before we go back to the violence.

893
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:08,812
So I guess, in a way, the only thing
I would change would be to kind of...

894
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,564
...maybe take that scene out.

895
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:14,192
I don't know how it would play
without it. Maybe I'd miss it again.

896
00:49:14,193 --> 00:49:17,404
The problem of being a director,
you mess around with your films.

897
00:49:17,405 --> 00:49:19,823
You never are actually finished
with them.

898
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:24,824
I wish I could, but the truth is Tama
has this place completely in control.

899
00:49:25,413 --> 00:49:27,748
Even if you find a spot
away from his cameras...

900
00:49:27,749 --> 00:49:29,708
...you'll be trapped in the corridors.

901
00:49:29,709 --> 00:49:32,836
There's no escape route.
No passage you can take.

902
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:37,048
If you make it, it will be
the same way you came.

903
00:49:37,049 --> 00:49:42,049
We're about to reach one of the sort
of more memorable stunts soon.

904
00:49:42,263 --> 00:49:45,557
So I kind of wanna talk a little bit
about that before we reach it.

905
00:49:45,558 --> 00:49:50,187
Whenever we design our stunt work
in the film, we always have...

906
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:54,107
...the safety of our stunt guys
in the forefront of our mind obviously.

907
00:49:54,108 --> 00:49:56,067
We have an ambulance crew
on standby.

908
00:49:56,068 --> 00:49:59,446
We always have a paramedics team
with us every day of the shoot...

909
00:49:59,447 --> 00:50:02,365
...whenever we do these action
sequences or stunt sequences.

910
00:50:02,366 --> 00:50:06,369
When we come to design the stunts,
we try to design them in a way...

911
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:10,457
...that is 100 percent safe for them.
It's impossible to get 100 percent.

912
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:12,542
You try to aspire to reach a point...

913
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:16,630
...where in camera,
it looks horribly dangerous...

914
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:19,925
...but when you're actually
executing it, it's very safe.

915
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:24,095
And this stunt coming up
with the back breaker on the wall...

916
00:50:24,096 --> 00:50:27,808
...is one of those where we tried our
best to make it as safe as possible...

917
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:30,435
...but just goes to show
that, no matter what...

918
00:50:30,436 --> 00:50:32,813
...things can go wrong
from time to time.

919
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:34,064
So the way we did it--

920
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:36,650
I'll give this explanation
before we get to it.

921
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:39,486
--Is that we took the wall out
from the atrium first.

922
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,906
When the guy gets flipped over,
we're controlling him with a wire...

923
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:46,201
...to make his path correct,
so he has to land on a specific mark.

924
00:50:46,202 --> 00:50:48,578
We took the wall out,
put crash mats everywhere.

925
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,123
And then when he gets flipped over
and lands on the crash mats...

926
00:50:52,124 --> 00:50:55,585
...once we get that take locked,
we lock the position of the camera...

927
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,671
...and then we put the wall back in.

928
00:50:57,672 --> 00:51:00,841
We lift him up on a wire one meter up,
drop him down...

929
00:51:00,842 --> 00:51:03,301
...so his legs--
His back can come down one side.

930
00:51:03,302 --> 00:51:05,887
Then we drop him
so his legs come down the other.

931
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:08,682
And then all three shots
are stitched together...

932
00:51:08,683 --> 00:51:13,683
...to create that effect of his flip over
the wall, smashing his back in half.

933
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:16,815
Where it went wrong,
when we did that first take of it...

934
00:51:16,816 --> 00:51:19,442
...the guys pulling the wire,
they pulled too hard.

935
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:22,529
And so instead of coming down nicely
on an angle and an arc...

936
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:24,865
...he ended up getting flipped
across the way...

937
00:51:24,866 --> 00:51:28,451
...and instead of dropping, he went
across, smashed the back of his head.

938
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:31,705
And the guys with the wire,
they lost balance and dropped him...

939
00:51:31,706 --> 00:51:35,917
...and so, yeah, he ended up falling
and missing the crash mats...

940
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:39,713
...and hit the concrete down
on the ground below, five-meter drop.

941
00:51:39,714 --> 00:51:42,674
And everyone on the crew,
their heart was in their mouths...

942
00:51:42,675 --> 00:51:44,301
...and we were freaking out.

943
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:46,344
We thought something
terrible happened.

944
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:48,638
The paramedics came in,
they checked him.

945
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,267
Ten minutes later he came to,
and was sort of, "Okay, let's go again."

946
00:51:52,268 --> 00:51:55,854
The usual sort of tough guy,
stunt guy thing of, you know:

947
00:51:55,855 --> 00:51:59,190
"I can take this kind of pain.
I can take this kind of punishment."

948
00:51:59,191 --> 00:52:02,944
So we told him, "No, you're gonna
take a break, have a couple days off.

949
00:52:02,945 --> 00:52:04,696
Come back to us four days later."

950
00:52:04,697 --> 00:52:07,866
And truth told, he did,
he did the shot and he nailed it then.

951
00:52:07,867 --> 00:52:11,036
I want to give a shout out,
because that guy's name is Rully...

952
00:52:11,037 --> 00:52:14,706
...and he's one of the toughest
stunt guys I've ever seen.

953
00:52:14,707 --> 00:52:19,707
So huge respect to him,
and he worked really hard on this film.

954
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:27,928
So we're coming up
to the machete-gang fight.

955
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:31,598
And I was talking about the idea
that every location should have...

956
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,768
...its one big set piece
which defines it from the others...

957
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:37,812
...so that we could keep the film
interesting to look at.

958
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:41,441
In the atrium we managed to have
the scene with the lights going out...

959
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:44,945
...and then also the scene
with, you know...

960
00:52:44,946 --> 00:52:47,113
...the stunt with the back breaker.

961
00:52:47,114 --> 00:52:49,950
And in the corridor,
we already had a big fight scene.

962
00:52:49,951 --> 00:52:52,160
There was lko with
a stick and a knife...

963
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:56,289
...and that's the sort of-- I guess
that's the iconic scene of that location.

964
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,875
And so for this one,
when we were designing it...

965
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:02,879
...we always wanted to kind of take
the fight-- We start in the corridors...

966
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,175
...but didn't want it inside the same
space. It's not visually as interesting.

967
00:53:07,176 --> 00:53:10,553
So we looked for a way that
we could get the fight to start here...

968
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,807
...but then develop further
and go into new locations.

969
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:17,852
So that informed us with the idea that
we had to break one of the doors...

970
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:20,772
...and actually be able
to go inside one of the rooms.

971
00:53:20,773 --> 00:53:24,609
It was a way for us to be able
to change the color of the film...

972
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:27,654
...and make sure that that room
was designed in a way...

973
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:31,616
...that it would be visually interesting,
different from everything we'd seen.

974
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:32,909
So we did a lot more...

975
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:37,910
...like, stronger reds and greens
and blue colors inside that room then.

976
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:42,585
Yeah, okay. Everyone tends
to get a reaction to that kill.

977
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:46,923
I'm ashamed to say it's my psychotic
brain that came up with that one.

978
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:49,634
We worked on different things
we could come up with...

979
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:52,012
...for how to do that transition
into the room.

980
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:54,973
Once we realized we were kicking
someone through the door...

981
00:53:54,974 --> 00:53:57,767
...we sort of had a brain wave
where we were thinking:

982
00:53:57,768 --> 00:54:01,021
"We could have splinters,
part of the door inside the frame...

983
00:54:01,022 --> 00:54:03,523
...and have it
like these jagged splinters."

984
00:54:03,524 --> 00:54:07,360
And so then, yeah,
it was just straightforward.

985
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:09,863
Jump backwards
and pull the guy's neck onto it.

986
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:13,158
But that whole moment...

987
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:16,953
Like, we wanted to riff on
different sort of martial-arts heroes...

988
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:21,954
...that we'd kind of grown up watching,
so for that, it was the whole thing of--

989
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:26,713
When you watch, like, a Bruce Lee
movie, and when Bruce Lee...

990
00:54:26,714 --> 00:54:31,384
...kills a guy in his movies, like when
he kills Oharra in Enter the Dragon...

991
00:54:31,385 --> 00:54:34,512
...and he leaps up and jumps down
and crushes his rib cage...

992
00:54:34,513 --> 00:54:38,058
...it's a sadistic move, sadistic scene.
It's all about his character...

993
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:40,685
...being overcome
with the rage of the situation...

994
00:54:40,686 --> 00:54:43,605
...and being overcome
by the violence inside him.

995
00:54:43,606 --> 00:54:46,316
And when you watch
that scene play out...

996
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:49,778
...like, the look on Bruce Lee's face
is one of pure anguish.

997
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:54,282
It's like he looks distraught
and, you know, disturbed by the fact...

998
00:54:54,283 --> 00:54:58,703
...that he went to that place, that he
went to that dark side of his psyche.

999
00:54:58,704 --> 00:55:00,413
That was something we riffed on.

1000
00:55:00,414 --> 00:55:02,916
That moment
when lko jumps backwards...

1001
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,793
...and slams his neck
onto the door...

1002
00:55:04,794 --> 00:55:07,629
...there's that moment
where there's a look on his face.

1003
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,465
He looks into the eyes
of the person he's killed.

1004
00:55:10,466 --> 00:55:14,094
Like, it's very slight
and it's played out very quickly...

1005
00:55:14,095 --> 00:55:16,054
...but it was the idea of, like, having
that part of him acknowledge...

1006
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:18,598
...but it was the idea of, like, having
that part of him acknowledge...

1007
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:23,599
...that what he's just done is,
for want of a better word, fucked up.

1008
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,615
That stunt took a long time to get.

1009
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:37,826
We spent about four days
shooting this.

1010
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:41,871
And it was a lot-- Obviously, because
of the fact that they're in tandem...

1011
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:46,543
...it meant we had a lot of wire work
going on to do that stunt safely.

1012
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:49,045
We built the wall
onto that building, as well.

1013
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,422
We used a real building
and just sort of...

1014
00:55:51,423 --> 00:55:54,843
...the Art Department designed
an entire wall structure to go down.

1015
00:55:54,844 --> 00:55:56,845
The ledge that
they bounce off then...

1016
00:55:56,846 --> 00:56:00,140
...was made out of soft rubber
and foam actually, so...

1017
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:04,769
Yeah, again, we did that as safely as
possible as well for the stunt design.

1018
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,689
But that was a long time
getting that shot to work right.

1019
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,690
And it took a lot of tweaking in post,
a lot of rehearsals, a lot of shooting.

1020
00:56:13,612 --> 00:56:17,615
Here, for me, it was really important
to have a moment like this...

1021
00:56:17,616 --> 00:56:20,493
...where we can kind of cut back
to the wife...

1022
00:56:20,494 --> 00:56:24,539
...and show, you know, just
what's at stake for lko's character...

1023
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,041
...what he could end up losing,
and to kind of...

1024
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:29,502
...sort of regain that support
of the audience...

1025
00:56:29,503 --> 00:56:33,339
...to realize that, you know, it's more
than a string of action scenes...

1026
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:38,340
...that there's some kind
of an emotional hook there as well.

1027
00:56:50,649 --> 00:56:54,194
And what I've always been a fan of
is that idea that, you know...

1028
00:56:54,195 --> 00:56:56,362
...that he's not just
a killing machine.

1029
00:56:56,363 --> 00:56:58,615
That's the thing we wanted
to bring into lko.

1030
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:02,744
Like, when he's up against people
who are not skilled, he's in control...

1031
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:05,246
...but when he was up
against the machete gang...

1032
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:09,083
...they had a strength to them, they
could have overpowered him as well.

1033
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:12,503
So it's kind of like he takes as much
of a beating as they take...

1034
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:14,714
...and that's kind of important
for us then.

1035
00:57:14,715 --> 00:57:17,050
It makes the audience
relate to him more.

1036
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:19,344
Makes them feel a stronger affinity
to him...

1037
00:57:19,345 --> 00:57:24,265
...because he's not, you know--
He's not this unreal superhero guy.

1038
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:29,062
If anyone other than his brother
came out of that room to grab him...

1039
00:57:29,063 --> 00:57:31,397
...he's dead,
and that's the end of his story.

1040
00:57:31,398 --> 00:57:35,944
That was something important for us,
sort of the design of his character...

1041
00:57:35,945 --> 00:57:39,781
...and the design of how we present
our heroes in our films then.

1042
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:44,782
Keep watch.

1043
00:57:46,622 --> 00:57:51,622
So earlier I mentioned about Joe
actually having a judo background.

1044
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:55,213
And we're about to reach a scene soon
where there's, like--

1045
00:57:55,214 --> 00:57:58,132
It's his opportunity to show off
his martial-arts skills...

1046
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:00,551
...when he fights against Mad Dog.

1047
00:58:00,552 --> 00:58:04,472
When Joe came in, we-- Once we
knew that we were gonna cast him...

1048
00:58:04,473 --> 00:58:07,850
...we started to look at choreography
we'd designed for that scene...

1049
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,353
...started to look at ways
we could approach it...

1050
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:12,480
...to sort of better suit his skill set.

1051
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:16,985
Whenever we design, it's me, lko and
Yayan designing the fight scenes...

1052
00:58:16,986 --> 00:58:20,238
...so it tends to be a lot more
sort of silat-oriented.

1053
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:23,157
But then once we get to know
who's gonna be in the cast...

1054
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:26,202
...then we can kind of re-adapt
that choreography...

1055
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:29,455
...in order to sort of, you know,
accommodate their skill set.

1056
00:58:29,456 --> 00:58:34,456
So when it came to this fight,
we wanted it to be a lot more...

1057
00:58:34,628 --> 00:58:37,880
...like, upper body heavy
for Joe's character.

1058
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:40,174
So we're playing with,
you know, two guys...

1059
00:58:40,175 --> 00:58:44,053
...who have very different styles,
very different body sizes.

1060
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:46,472
You know,
Joe towers over Mad Dog.

1061
00:58:46,473 --> 00:58:49,475
But we wanted to kind of reflect that
in the choreography.

1062
00:58:49,476 --> 00:58:53,479
So Mad Dog is the one that's
coming in fast and close quarters...

1063
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,858
...and trying to sort of, you know,
take him down, you know...

1064
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:59,485
...and high attacks, low attacks,
all over his body.

1065
00:58:59,486 --> 00:59:02,405
Whereas Joe's character
is sort of so overwhelmed...

1066
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:04,741
...by the speed and ferocity
of the attacks...

1067
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:07,368
...that all he's capable to do
for a long time...

1068
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:10,121
...is to kind of use throws
or pushes...

1069
00:59:10,122 --> 00:59:13,207
...to kind of almost keep a distance
between him and Mad Dog...

1070
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:18,208
...and to try to overpower him through
strength as opposed to technique.

1071
00:59:19,465 --> 00:59:24,465
Another time maybe.
I'll take my chances here first.

1072
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:32,643
Suit yourself.

1073
00:59:32,644 --> 00:59:37,644
We're going back up there.
We're going to find them.

1074
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:41,819
And only then do we leave.

1075
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:46,741
Any objections?

1076
00:59:46,742 --> 00:59:49,410
Thought not.

1077
00:59:49,411 --> 00:59:54,082
Everyone ready.

1078
00:59:54,083 --> 00:59:59,083
Move.

1079
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:12,725
This is the first time we're gonna get to
see Mad Dog do any kind of fighting.

1080
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:17,726
And we-- At the start of the film,
when we see him--

1081
01:00:18,273 --> 01:00:21,818
It's different because I know him
and I know what he's capable of.

1082
01:00:21,819 --> 01:00:23,986
But an audience,
when they see Mad Dog...

1083
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,988
...he seems
like this unassuming type.

1084
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:29,117
Like, we don't really get this idea
of him being such a badass.

1085
01:00:29,118 --> 01:00:31,160
And this was the time
when we wanted...

1086
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:34,497
...to, like, fully introduce
that side of his character.

1087
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:39,498
And so in this standoff, this sort of,
you know, knife and gun standoff...

1088
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:43,423
...we wanted to kind of have this sort
of very cold, very detached, very--

1089
01:00:43,424 --> 01:00:46,926
Almost, like, purposefully slow
buildup to the fight...

1090
01:00:46,927 --> 01:00:50,096
...to really set up this idea
of what he's capable of...

1091
01:00:50,097 --> 01:00:52,849
...and what type of person he is.

1092
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:56,519
Later on, when we come to the
moment where he sets his gun aside...

1093
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,773
...like, it wasn't designed in that way to
be, you know, oh, the bullshit thing of:

1094
01:01:00,774 --> 01:01:02,650
Well, let's set up another fight.

1095
01:01:02,651 --> 01:01:05,486
He's gonna unload his gun
and start fighting hand to hand.

1096
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:08,030
It's not about, like,
a code of ethics for him.

1097
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:11,075
It's not about being respectful
to Jaka.

1098
01:01:11,076 --> 01:01:12,535
It's just about the fact...

1099
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:16,080
...that Mad Dog takes no pleasure
from shooting someone in the face.

1100
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:18,541
He takes no pleasure
in killing someone that way.

1101
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:22,712
The way he wants to kill someone
is vicious. It's violent.

1102
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:25,715
And he wants to feel
like he's overpowered someone.

1103
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:27,175
It's not enough to just--

1104
01:01:27,176 --> 01:01:30,261
It's not enough to have something
mechanical in his hands...

1105
01:01:30,262 --> 01:01:32,513
...that kind of gives him that power.

1106
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:37,226
And so when he's unloading the gun
and putting it aside...

1107
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:40,396
...he's talking about things like,
"This is the pulse."

1108
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:43,483
And it's that sense
that when he fights these guys...

1109
01:01:43,484 --> 01:01:45,943
...he wants to feel that moment
when the person--

1110
01:01:45,944 --> 01:01:48,738
He wants to know when that guy
breathes his last breath.

1111
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:52,450
He wants to feel that moment when
the pulse in him starts to die down.

1112
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:55,161
And it's that sort of--

1113
01:01:55,162 --> 01:01:58,831
That's what makes him a much darker
character than I've written before.

1114
01:01:58,832 --> 01:02:01,334
And what makes Yayan
so great in it...

1115
01:02:01,335 --> 01:02:05,129
...is that he totally committed
to the role and he totally went in for it.

1116
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,674
And, you know, I'll be honest,
he surprised me even.

1117
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:11,010
The way he performed this
is just so great.

1118
01:02:11,011 --> 01:02:14,639
It was a surprise. I had no idea
what he was gonna bring to this role...

1119
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,682
...and how he was gonna perform it.

1120
01:02:16,683 --> 01:02:20,478
But he just played it right. He kind of--
He didn't go pantomime with it.

1121
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:22,188
He didn't go OTT.

1122
01:02:22,189 --> 01:02:27,189
He just played it in a very cool, cold
and calculated way.

1123
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:42,208
So there you go. You're gonna see--
There's the first of our judo throws.

1124
01:02:42,209 --> 01:02:44,585
We kind of tried to--
Earlier I was saying...

1125
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:49,215
...we tried to incorporate some of
his skill set in terms of choreography.

1126
01:02:49,216 --> 01:02:52,301
Yayan's going crazy. He's trying
to throw and push him away...

1127
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:57,302
...and keep him at a distance then.

1128
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,892
One of the things
we wanted to incorporate...

1129
01:02:59,893 --> 01:03:02,937
...were like rough-looking throws.

1130
01:03:02,938 --> 01:03:06,440
So this is one of them. It's not
a clean throw. It's kind of like--

1131
01:03:06,441 --> 01:03:08,568
There's a roughness
and a rawness to it.

1132
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:11,988
They're not-- They never kind of get
a proper grip on someone...

1133
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:14,991
...and they just kind of, like,
hurl bodies into objects.

1134
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:17,660
That was one of the things I wanted
to do, to kind of--

1135
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:19,954
When we were designing
the fight scenes...

1136
01:03:19,955 --> 01:03:22,832
...we knew we were gonna have,
like, crisp choreography...

1137
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,917
...and, like, a complexity to it.

1138
01:03:24,918 --> 01:03:28,879
We wanted to mix it all in with these
slightly rougher approaches as well.

1139
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,426
Like, where we have a bit more
desperation at play as well.

1140
01:03:33,427 --> 01:03:38,222
I want to, like, say one or two things
about, you know, screen fighters...

1141
01:03:38,223 --> 01:03:42,101
...and their performance,
which I think gets often overlooked...

1142
01:03:42,102 --> 01:03:43,978
...when it comes to people that...

1143
01:03:43,979 --> 01:03:46,355
...criticize actors
for these types of films.

1144
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:49,942
And it's like--
It's really hard what they do anyway...

1145
01:03:49,943 --> 01:03:52,278
...from purely
on a choreography level...

1146
01:03:52,279 --> 01:03:55,197
...in terms of the timing
and the precision required...

1147
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:57,742
...for each of these shots
to be executed properly.

1148
01:03:57,743 --> 01:04:02,038
But also it's maintaining that emotional
connection to the fight as well.

1149
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,541
And maintaining a performance
for shot for shot.

1150
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,501
You forget that we shoot these film--

1151
01:04:07,502 --> 01:04:10,379
These scenes, it takes us four days
of doing fight scenes.

1152
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:14,091
Every shot is about, like, one-second,
two-second duration.

1153
01:04:14,092 --> 01:04:16,927
And we do like 30,
sometimes 40 takes on each one.

1154
01:04:16,928 --> 01:04:18,846
And then in the process of that...

1155
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:22,266
...they have to maintain that sense
of where their character is...

1156
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:24,769
...during that fight.
There's a shift throughout.

1157
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:28,814
There's, you know-- There's a gradual
loss of control throughout the fight...

1158
01:04:28,815 --> 01:04:32,068
...and a gradual growing
of desperation in the fighters.

1159
01:04:32,069 --> 01:04:36,489
That's something that's really hard
for them to hold onto and maintain.

1160
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,699
Soto me, you know...

1161
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,328
...it's just as hard as any dramatic
performance to do this type of thing.

1162
01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:47,329
And I'm really proud of Joe and Yayan
for this scene. I think they nailed it.

1163
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,418
One of the things we wanted to do...

1164
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:52,254
...was to kind of make Joe's death
count for something.

1165
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,091
To make it have an emotional
resonance with the audience.

1166
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:57,176
And so we took out all the Foley.

1167
01:04:57,177 --> 01:05:00,471
We took out all the audio,
all the live audio from the scene.

1168
01:05:00,472 --> 01:05:03,766
And we just had it as just purely down
to score or a drone.

1169
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:05,393
What happened with those is--

1170
01:05:05,394 --> 01:05:09,271
Actually, the way we came across it
was by accident.

1171
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:13,526
When I was in with Fajar and Ogi,
we were designing the sound mix...

1172
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:15,861
...they wanted to play the music
they designed.

1173
01:05:15,862 --> 01:05:18,572
And when they were
playing it back to me...

1174
01:05:18,573 --> 01:05:23,119
...they'd forgot to unmute
the live action and the Foley channels.

1175
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,204
So it played just the drone.

1176
01:05:25,205 --> 01:05:27,748
And as I sat there
watching it play out...

1177
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:31,836
...once the scene finished, they said,
"Oh, sorry. We'll turn the live audio...

1178
01:05:31,837 --> 01:05:34,255
...and the Foley back on.
We made a mistake."

1179
01:05:34,256 --> 01:05:37,216
And I said, "No, no, no.
Go back and play it again."

1180
01:05:37,217 --> 01:05:40,928
And then when they played it again,
I listened to it with just the drones...

1181
01:05:40,929 --> 01:05:44,765
...and it just felt like it had this--
It had a much stronger quality to it.

1182
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:47,893
It kind of-- It sobered the film up
almost, you know.

1183
01:05:47,894 --> 01:05:51,230
It kind of gave us this one moment
where it wasn't about spectacle.

1184
01:05:51,231 --> 01:05:54,275
It wasn't just about, you know,
blood being spilled...

1185
01:05:54,276 --> 01:05:56,235
...or inventive ways to kill someone.

1186
01:05:56,236 --> 01:05:59,488
It was giving you, like,
an emotional connection.

1187
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:03,284
And so we kind of played it back
another two or three times.

1188
01:06:03,285 --> 01:06:05,828
We all came
to a unanimous decision, thinking...

1189
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:09,081
...it worked much better like this.
You know, it was a--

1190
01:06:09,082 --> 01:06:14,082
It was a very sort of happy accident
that we all stumbled across then.

1191
01:06:15,088 --> 01:06:18,883
You have to leave this place.

1192
01:06:18,884 --> 01:06:22,261
So here we got a scene
where we start to kind of--

1193
01:06:22,262 --> 01:06:25,473
We got maybe a section here
that's 10 or 12 minutes' worth...

1194
01:06:25,474 --> 01:06:28,142
...where there's like a respite
from the action...

1195
01:06:28,143 --> 01:06:30,186
...and it's more dialogue-based.

1196
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:34,356
And we kind of uncover a little bit
more plot and a bit more character.

1197
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:37,318
I was very cautious that when
we were designing this film...

1198
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:40,237
...that we had to move
at a very sort of breakneck pace.

1199
01:06:40,238 --> 01:06:44,408
And once I kind of realized
that it was all around one event...

1200
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:46,869
...and sort of, you know,
from dawn...

1201
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:50,831
...until about 4:00, 5:00
in the afternoon...

1202
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:53,667
...it's not a large period of time
we're dealing with.

1203
01:06:53,668 --> 01:06:55,461
It's not even a full day.

1204
01:06:55,462 --> 01:06:59,131
So once I acknowledged that, it was
one of those things where I felt...

1205
01:06:59,132 --> 01:07:04,132
...like if we put too much plot and too
many details into the character arcs...

1206
01:07:04,262 --> 01:07:07,932
...it could overwhelm the film and it
could kind of create an imbalance...

1207
01:07:07,933 --> 01:07:11,143
...between, you know, the spectacle
that we were going for...

1208
01:07:11,144 --> 01:07:15,856
...you know, and sort of make it
a little too drama heavy or forced.

1209
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:20,236
So we decided to kind of have
this one little moment here...

1210
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:24,657
...where we'd put a breathing space
and develop the plot a little further...

1211
01:07:24,658 --> 01:07:28,619
...and uncover more information about
the brothers and their back-story.

1212
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,581
And the reason why they haven't seen
each other in such a long time.

1213
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:36,168
And just to give the audience
that little bit of an extra hook then.

1214
01:07:36,169 --> 01:07:39,755
So we had already kind of established
a sense of, you know...

1215
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,925
...we wanna follow Rama,
lko's character...

1216
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:45,386
...because of the fact
that he's got this wife...

1217
01:07:45,387 --> 01:07:49,014
...and expecting child
waiting for him back at home.

1218
01:07:49,015 --> 01:07:50,891
But I wanted that to be a reason...

1219
01:07:50,892 --> 01:07:53,686
...why we'd have an emotional hook
to the brother too.

1220
01:07:53,687 --> 01:07:58,274
So this was one of those opportunities
to kind of establish their relationship...

1221
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:02,444
...and to kind of show
why they care about each other...

1222
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:06,448
...and why it was so important that lko
would bring him out of this building.

1223
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:11,449
A boy, due in two months.

1224
01:08:14,624 --> 01:08:16,750
I tend to--

1225
01:08:16,751 --> 01:08:20,671
When I'm writing these stories,
I tend to try to kind of--

1226
01:08:20,672 --> 01:08:22,882
This might sound
a bit cheese ball...

1227
01:08:22,883 --> 01:08:27,386
...considering the sort of situation
that these guys find themselves in...

1228
01:08:27,387 --> 01:08:30,055
...but I tend to kind of try
to put in elements...

1229
01:08:30,056 --> 01:08:32,558
...from my own life experience
in these films.

1230
01:08:32,559 --> 01:08:34,727
Not that I've been in a building
like this.

1231
01:08:34,728 --> 01:08:37,271
But more the idea of in Merantau...

1232
01:08:37,272 --> 01:08:40,900
...we had this moment where lko
was talking about his brother...

1233
01:08:40,901 --> 01:08:45,195
...in, like, a concrete tube, and he
was talking about their childhood...

1234
01:08:45,196 --> 01:08:47,573
...growing up together
and what they were like.

1235
01:08:47,574 --> 01:08:51,118
And that came from, you know,
me and my brother...

1236
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:53,579
...because I'd moved to Indonesia
at that time...

1237
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,997
...and it was a big move.

1238
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:57,416
Me and my brother
have always been very close...

1239
01:08:57,417 --> 01:09:01,211
...and he's always been a major part
of my life, supported me throughout.

1240
01:09:01,212 --> 01:09:03,297
And, you know,
he's an older brother too.

1241
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:07,426
So I'm always kind of
the lko character then.

1242
01:09:07,427 --> 01:09:10,471
Like, he becomes my voice box
in a way.

1243
01:09:10,472 --> 01:09:12,640
And, yeah, so in Merantau...

1244
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:15,851
...it was all about being away
from family, being away from home.

1245
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:18,896
That was something I could bring
to it from a personal level.

1246
01:09:18,897 --> 01:09:21,148
In this one,
it was more about that idea...

1247
01:09:21,149 --> 01:09:23,943
...of knowing what it's like
to be an expecting father.

1248
01:09:23,944 --> 01:09:27,863
And whenever you go somewhere,
you know, you have that thing...

1249
01:09:27,864 --> 01:09:31,158
...where you make sure that
you're gonna be there for that child.

1250
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:35,412
That you're gonna-- There's no greater
fear than not being able to be there...

1251
01:09:35,413 --> 01:09:37,665
...to see your child be born
into the world.

1252
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:42,211
There's no greater fear than not being
able to see every day of their life.

1253
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:46,173
So that was something I could bring
to it from a personal level then.

1254
01:09:46,174 --> 01:09:48,884
- Where are your men?
- Still hunting.

1255
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:51,720
So this scene, we actually decided
to kind of play this...

1256
01:09:51,721 --> 01:09:54,598
...like, pretty dry humor, really.

1257
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:57,768
This is, like, I guess in a way,
it's more like British humor.

1258
01:09:57,769 --> 01:10:00,813
But it seems to go down well
with the audience. They get it.

1259
01:10:00,814 --> 01:10:05,401
And in a large part, that's down
to lko and Dani's performance.

1260
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:09,738
They-- We played it when
we gave them direction, actually...

1261
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:13,200
We had them play it almost like,
you know--

1262
01:10:13,201 --> 01:10:15,035
Almost like schoolkids in a way.

1263
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,663
The idea that they're both
as stubborn as each other.

1264
01:10:17,664 --> 01:10:22,664
And it's kind of played very sort of
very dryly and very abruptly. And the--

1265
01:10:22,961 --> 01:10:25,129
Down to the way we positioned
the camera...

1266
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:26,922
...the composition of the camera--

1267
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:31,923
Just this sort of like almost
a double act between the two of them.

1268
01:10:34,723 --> 01:10:37,599
I can point out
there's a little bit of CG work there...

1269
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,352
...that none of you guys
will really, you know, realize.

1270
01:10:40,353 --> 01:10:42,521
When Jaka gets dragged
into this elevator...

1271
01:10:42,522 --> 01:10:44,481
...that elevator's not actually there.

1272
01:10:44,482 --> 01:10:46,483
We just had
a blank green-screen wall...

1273
01:10:46,484 --> 01:10:50,696
...and my online guy kind of put in
the tiled wall and the elevator doors...

1274
01:10:50,697 --> 01:10:52,865
...and, you know,
animated everything then.

1275
01:10:52,866 --> 01:10:53,282
Even down to the bloodstain
on the floor.

1276
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:54,908
Even down to the bloodstain
on the floor.

1277
01:10:54,909 --> 01:10:59,909
So all of that was done in post
then with CG.

1278
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:06,670
So these are another couple
of little tricks we did to kind of make--

1279
01:11:06,671 --> 01:11:08,797
This is the L-section corridor.

1280
01:11:08,798 --> 01:11:13,052
And again, like, we try to kind of make
you feel like you're on different ﬂoors...

1281
01:11:13,053 --> 01:11:17,514
...that there's something different that
you can kind of find interesting in it.

1282
01:11:17,515 --> 01:11:19,558
So, you know,
this one was just simple--

1283
01:11:19,559 --> 01:11:22,436
You know, we just
put a flickering light in there...

1284
01:11:22,437 --> 01:11:26,648
...just to give it a little bit of a different
feel from the rest of the corridors.

1285
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:30,152
And one of the design things
that we did to kind of cheat...

1286
01:11:30,153 --> 01:11:33,447
...and to make it much easier for us
to switch from floor to ﬂoor:

1287
01:11:33,448 --> 01:11:37,534
You'll notice on the doors, we actually
write the numbers down in chalk.

1288
01:11:37,535 --> 01:11:40,954
The reason we did that was all
we'd have to do is wipe off a number...

1289
01:11:40,955 --> 01:11:44,583
...and then re-write and put like
fifth floor, sixth floor, seventh floor.

1290
01:11:44,584 --> 01:11:46,585
All we have to do
is change the number.

1291
01:11:46,586 --> 01:11:48,921
It was a very quick
and effective thing to do.

1292
01:11:48,922 --> 01:11:51,340
And he ran.

1293
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:55,761
Sergeant ordered me to protect him.

1294
01:11:55,762 --> 01:11:59,056
Right now all we can do
is try to survive this.

1295
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:01,767
So I should talk a bit
about Pierre Gruno, actually...

1296
01:12:01,768 --> 01:12:05,395
...who plays Wahyu,
the corrupt cop in the film.

1297
01:12:05,396 --> 01:12:09,441
He came to us for an audition
and sort of, like, nailed the role.

1298
01:12:09,442 --> 01:12:12,611
And we did a little kind
of fight audition for him...

1299
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:16,406
...because we knew that he had a
small action scene later on in the film.

1300
01:12:16,407 --> 01:12:19,660
Obviously, Pierre is not gonna be able
to do the same fighting...

1301
01:12:19,661 --> 01:12:24,373
...as lko and as Eka do in that scene,
but he gave it everything.

1302
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:27,668
He really, really did go for it
with the fight scenes he did get.

1303
01:12:27,669 --> 01:12:29,962
And even in the rehearsal...

1304
01:12:29,963 --> 01:12:32,965
...when we showed him
the choreography, he split the lip...

1305
01:12:32,966 --> 01:12:35,509
...of one of the fighters
he was fighting against.

1306
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:37,469
He had to slam the guy onto a table.

1307
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:39,680
He just slammed him right into it.

1308
01:12:39,681 --> 01:12:44,393
And so the poor stunt guy came away
from it with a split lip.

1309
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:47,729
Pierre came to me and said,
"Please, go a little bit easy with me...

1310
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,399
...on the choreography,"
because he had an injured leg.

1311
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,027
He had a bad kneecap
from an old sports injury, I guess.

1312
01:12:54,028 --> 01:12:58,407
And, yeah, we gave him kind of--

1313
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:01,910
All his choreography becomes
sort of more brute force stuff than it's--

1314
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:05,914
It's more like a boxing style really,
with a little bit of silat in there as well.

1315
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:10,544
But we'll touch on that later on
when we get to the drugs-lab scene.

1316
01:13:10,545 --> 01:13:14,548
I guess I should really give a shout-out
to Moti, my art designer of the film.

1317
01:13:14,549 --> 01:13:17,843
Because we talked earlier
about the idea of, like, building sets...

1318
01:13:17,844 --> 01:13:20,762
...and not being able
to use a real building.

1319
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:23,891
And, yeah, like, Moti, I've worked
with him since Merantau...

1320
01:13:23,892 --> 01:13:26,185
...and he's just such
a great art design--

1321
01:13:26,186 --> 01:13:27,936
Art designer for this film.

1322
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:30,480
And this location, Tama's office...

1323
01:13:30,481 --> 01:13:33,192
...was the closest
to being almost exactly the same...

1324
01:13:33,193 --> 01:13:35,444
...as I had imagined it in my head.

1325
01:13:35,445 --> 01:13:39,740
You know, we wanted to go
a little bit retro with CCTV monitors...

1326
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:41,950
...using old television sets.

1327
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:44,786
And, yeah,
they did such a great job on it.

1328
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,956
It-- You know, they didn't spend
that much money...

1329
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:50,542
...but they made it look really,
really cool.

1330
01:13:50,543 --> 01:13:53,086
So, yeah. Just coming into this set...

1331
01:13:53,087 --> 01:13:57,299
...when they finally finished the design
on it was kind of really exciting to see.

1332
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,093
When the guys were putting up
the lights, it came alive.

1333
01:14:00,094 --> 01:14:05,094
And so I was really, really happy
with the work they did on it.

1334
01:14:05,725 --> 01:14:09,144
So this is another one of those things
where you hint to the audience.

1335
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:12,397
You put hints in there where the
audience know what's gonna happen.

1336
01:14:12,398 --> 01:14:16,026
Because we've seen him cutting
an apple with a really, you know--

1337
01:14:16,027 --> 01:14:19,446
It's not a kitchen knife.
It's a knife to fight someone with.

1338
01:14:19,447 --> 01:14:23,909
We've got him playing with the idea of
he must have something in his hands.

1339
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:27,037
So you kind of put these
little visual hints to the audience...

1340
01:14:27,038 --> 01:14:30,415
...so that they get the idea that
something's gonna go wrong soon.

1341
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:35,087
But you kind of-- It's that creating
that level of expectation.

1342
01:14:35,088 --> 01:14:38,090
Waiting for that moment
when that strike is gonna come in.

1343
01:14:38,091 --> 01:14:42,928
And, yeah. Here it comes.

1344
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:46,640
So here's another example then
of Jerry's fine work, using--

1345
01:14:46,641 --> 01:14:49,935
Making a sort
of prosthetic hand for Doni.

1346
01:14:49,936 --> 01:14:53,105
He spent a long time on that,
went into quite a lot of detail...

1347
01:14:53,106 --> 01:14:57,609
...in order to get the fingernails
and the hair on the hand just right.

1348
01:14:57,610 --> 01:15:00,445
And when he first showed me
that hand...

1349
01:15:00,446 --> 01:15:04,283
...maybe I'm just a wimp, but I just--
I don't like seeing that kind of stuff.

1350
01:15:04,284 --> 01:15:07,160
It just freaked me out,
something so shocking, so...

1351
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:10,205
The effect, actually,
was a combination then...

1352
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:13,208
...of the sort of fake blood
and the practical effects...

1353
01:15:13,209 --> 01:15:14,710
...but with some CG as well.

1354
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:18,255
We had a slight problem with the
pressure of the blood inside the hand.

1355
01:15:18,256 --> 01:15:21,883
So when the knife went down into it,
it trapped the valve.

1356
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:25,554
When the blood was to come out,
it was to seep out over the hand.

1357
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:28,390
But as soon as the pressure
was relieved off the knife...

1358
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:32,144
...and he went to grab the monitor,
blood just sprayed everywhere.

1359
01:15:32,145 --> 01:15:35,230
So again, one of those situations...

1360
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:37,607
...where I had to turn to Andi,
my online guy...

1361
01:15:37,608 --> 01:15:40,402
...and just give him another shot
to fix.

1362
01:15:40,403 --> 01:15:43,947
And, yeah, that list got pretty long
by the end of the shoot. It was--

1363
01:15:43,948 --> 01:15:47,617
I think almost every day, there was
a moment where we would say:

1364
01:15:47,618 --> 01:15:50,829
"Oh, okay. We'll give that to Andi."

1365
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:53,248
So poor Andi ended up
having a lot of stuff...

1366
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:56,585
...that he had to kind of fix up
in the end of the film.

1367
01:15:56,586 --> 01:16:01,586
--If you were to die in front of him?

1368
01:16:02,967 --> 01:16:06,178
And so now, we're kind of setting
ourselves up ready...

1369
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:08,972
...for the final stretch
of the fight scenes of the film.

1370
01:16:08,973 --> 01:16:13,518
And we're about to reach, like--
One of my favorite fights in the film...

1371
01:16:13,519 --> 01:16:15,145
...was in the drugs lab.

1372
01:16:15,146 --> 01:16:19,775
And it was a great opportunity to be
able to show different fighting styles...

1373
01:16:19,776 --> 01:16:22,361
...but, like, all in one scene.
So you've got--

1374
01:16:22,362 --> 01:16:24,404
lko is gonna be using silat then.

1375
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:26,782
And Eka comes from
a tae kwon do background.

1376
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:29,117
And then we have Pierre Gruno,
who plays Wahyu...

1377
01:16:29,118 --> 01:16:30,327
And then we have Pierre Gruno,
who plays Wahyu...

1378
01:16:30,328 --> 01:16:34,998
...doing more of a sort of rough
street-fight style then as well.

1379
01:16:34,999 --> 01:16:39,127
I tend to--
I'm the, like, offline editor for the film.

1380
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:43,924
And when it comes
to the fight sequences...

1381
01:16:43,925 --> 01:16:47,052
...often the sort
of more time-consuming process...

1382
01:16:47,053 --> 01:16:50,680
...is the fact that in between the shot
setups, when we're getting ready--

1383
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:52,974
Go from one scene to the next...

1384
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,352
...I'm taking wherever the footage
is coming...

1385
01:16:55,353 --> 01:16:58,605
...we load it in and start
to edit the fight scene there and then.

1386
01:16:58,606 --> 01:17:01,566
So we have the laptops positioned
somewhere off camera.

1387
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,445
So every time you're watching this,
maybe about five, 10 meters away...

1388
01:17:05,446 --> 01:17:09,658
...in some part of that location, we're
sat there with the laptop and monitors.

1389
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:13,078
And as soon as that shot is done
and we locked on it...

1390
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:18,041
...it's loaded in and we start to drop it
into, like, a Final Cut timeline.

1391
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:21,086
We do previs video storyboards,
like I mentioned earlier.

1392
01:17:21,087 --> 01:17:24,506
We do, like, these previs video
storyboards, which is shot for shot...

1393
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:27,801
...edit for edit as we want it
to appear in the final film.

1394
01:17:27,802 --> 01:17:31,471
And it ends up becoming like about--
Close to, like, maybe 95 percent...

1395
01:17:31,472 --> 01:17:35,392
...the same as what we do in the
previs when it comes to this version.

1396
01:17:35,393 --> 01:17:37,144
Occasionally, what we'll do is...

1397
01:17:37,145 --> 01:17:41,022
...we'll shoot the opening
of a fight scene for the first day.

1398
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,483
We shoot the closing
of a fight scene on day two.

1399
01:17:43,484 --> 01:17:45,819
And then if we have day three
and day four...

1400
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:50,657
...that's what we use to bridge between
those bookends of the scenes.

1401
01:17:50,658 --> 01:17:55,120
So we know that no matter what,
even if we have to drop choreography...

1402
01:17:55,121 --> 01:17:57,873
...we've got a beginning
and an end to the scene then.

1403
01:17:57,874 --> 01:18:02,669
So that's kind of our sort of security.
That's our safety net then.

1404
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:04,546
We got a lot sort of short shots.

1405
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:07,466
But here, we have our first sort
of big, long moment.

1406
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:09,926
This was the cam--
The cameraman had to go 360...

1407
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:13,263
...so there was no room for us
to be able to monitor the situation.

1408
01:18:13,264 --> 01:18:15,056
So throughout this entire take...

1409
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:18,518
...because the camera's turning
more than 360 actually...

1410
01:18:18,519 --> 01:18:22,230
...I had to hide in the corner,
listen to those shouts going on...

1411
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:26,026
...from all the fighters until my DOP
would end up calling cut.

1412
01:18:26,027 --> 01:18:30,155
And then finally, we kind of rush out
and check playback.

1413
01:18:30,156 --> 01:18:33,116
And we did about maybe
15 to 20 takes on that alone then...

1414
01:18:33,117 --> 01:18:35,535
...just to kind of get that shot done.

1415
01:18:35,536 --> 01:18:37,913
But I think, like,
in our experiences...

1416
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:40,582
...when it comes to action,
we do so many takes...

1417
01:18:40,583 --> 01:18:43,919
...and it's really hard to get it exactly
as we want it.

1418
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,755
And I think one of the ways
that we shoot fight scenes...

1419
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:49,758
...is that everything
has to be like a jigsaw piece.

1420
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:53,261
You know, the in and out points
of every shot are so specific...

1421
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:56,306
...because of the choreography
and the video storyboard...

1422
01:18:56,307 --> 01:19:01,307
...that we will go through those takes
to make sure we get it done right.

1423
01:19:01,562 --> 01:19:05,690
So there's a really cool stomp
to the face coming up soon...

1424
01:19:05,691 --> 01:19:10,445
...and I'm gonna share with you the
cheat for how we can do this safely.

1425
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:13,240
So it looks horrible.
It feels like we're following...

1426
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:17,160
...the stamp down into the guy's face,
but it's actually two shots cut together.

1427
01:19:17,161 --> 01:19:19,871
Start off on the top one,
where we point up at Dagu...

1428
01:19:19,872 --> 01:19:21,957
...and we do a whip tilt down.

1429
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:25,043
And in the whip tilt down,
we out to another shot then.

1430
01:19:25,044 --> 01:19:28,296
There's a blur in the movement
that you can do a seamless edit.

1431
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:31,049
And so the second part then...

1432
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,718
...is we put Dagu's hand...

1433
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:36,930
...through a pair of trousers
and then into the shoe...

1434
01:19:36,931 --> 01:19:38,932
...so we have more control
on the stomp.

1435
01:19:38,933 --> 01:19:42,936
He's hitting the guy in the face
with his hand, but it's inside the boot.

1436
01:19:42,937 --> 01:19:44,521
Then we do that second shot.

1437
01:19:44,522 --> 01:19:47,941
We just continue a tilt down
to the face and then it's the impact.

1438
01:19:47,942 --> 01:19:51,570
Both shots get chopped together,
and you feel like it's all one movement.

1439
01:19:51,571 --> 01:19:56,571
You feel like it's all one sort of
aggressive stomp to the face...

1440
01:19:56,909 --> 01:20:01,909
...but it just hurts a little bit.
It's not a full hit to the face.

1441
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:10,459
So now we're about to introduce
the big final fight of the film.

1442
01:20:10,548 --> 01:20:14,050
This is the torture-room fight
and this was the longest one...

1443
01:20:14,051 --> 01:20:15,885
...it took to design and the most--

1444
01:20:15,886 --> 01:20:20,015
The most complex as well
in terms of the choreography layout.

1445
01:20:20,016 --> 01:20:24,060
And to be honest, like, you know,
not to be too up myself...

1446
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:26,980
...but we feel the most proud
about this scene.

1447
01:20:26,981 --> 01:20:30,609
This is like-- We felt very strongly
while we were shooting it...

1448
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:33,862
...and when we kind of finished
the film that this is probably...

1449
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:38,325
...the best fight scene that we've ever
done out of both of our films so far.

1450
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:42,078
It was an intense shoot. it was a really,
really tough shoot to do.

1451
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:44,456
There's about six minutes'
worth of fighting...

1452
01:20:44,457 --> 01:20:46,875
...and two minutes of drama
wraparound.

1453
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:51,876
Usually for that, if we were working
on a basis of a Hong Kong schedule...

1454
01:20:51,964 --> 01:20:55,800
...maybe we'd get given
about 15 to 20 days to shoot that.

1455
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:59,054
But we had eight,
and the guys were working--

1456
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:02,307
Like, we were fight--
They were fighting 14 hours a day...

1457
01:21:02,308 --> 01:21:04,476
...six consecutive days in a row.

1458
01:21:04,477 --> 01:21:08,063
Now, the analogy that I prefer
is that if you think about it this way.

1459
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:10,106
If you go to the gym for one hour...

1460
01:21:10,107 --> 01:21:12,942
...and the next day you feel like shit
and can't move...

1461
01:21:12,943 --> 01:21:15,654
...imagine fighting
for 14 hours in one day...

1462
01:21:15,655 --> 01:21:20,367
...and then doing it again the next day,
again the next day, again and again.

1463
01:21:20,368 --> 01:21:24,454
You've got some white guy telling you
it's no good and you have to go again.

1464
01:21:24,455 --> 01:21:29,292
So that's the level of commitment
and dedication the guys have.

1465
01:21:29,293 --> 01:21:32,170
I'm gonna give you a spoiler.
This is gonna ruin the scene.

1466
01:21:32,171 --> 01:21:35,298
Watch the fan in the background.
It changes direction.

1467
01:21:35,299 --> 01:21:37,467
Okay, so basically,
what happened was...

1468
01:21:37,468 --> 01:21:40,762
...we had a fan built in
but the motor was too fast...

1469
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:42,806
...and it distracted
in the background.

1470
01:21:42,807 --> 01:21:46,935
So for every single shot in this scene,
whenever you see that fan turning...

1471
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:49,312
...it's an art guy
tapping it with his finger...

1472
01:21:49,313 --> 01:21:52,941
...to kind of keep the fan moving
at a slower pace.

1473
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:57,942
And we wound up-- Ekki was our guy
who was turning the fan at that point.

1474
01:21:58,114 --> 01:22:02,450
We gave him so much stick for the
fact that he turned it the wrong way.

1475
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:06,037
So that poor guy got given
a lot of shit by the crew then...

1476
01:22:06,038 --> 01:22:09,958
...but it was all lighthearted stuff
and we all loved him, really.

1477
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:12,168
He worked his ass off
throughout the shoot.

1478
01:22:12,169 --> 01:22:15,505
He's just one of those guys
where it's easy to make fun of him...

1479
01:22:15,506 --> 01:22:17,340
...and he'll take it seriously.

1480
01:22:17,341 --> 01:22:22,341
So, yeah, we gave him all sorts
of hell on the shoot.

1481
01:22:25,599 --> 01:22:30,599
So this is kind of the epitome of
Mad Dog being a complete badass...

1482
01:22:31,105 --> 01:22:33,690
...that when he's faced up
against these two guys...

1483
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:37,068
...it's like he knew that Jaka
wasn't enough of a challenge.

1484
01:22:37,069 --> 01:22:40,739
So he's like,
"Okay, two-on-one fight."

1485
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,700
The main, like, influence for this...

1486
01:22:43,701 --> 01:22:47,787
...came from a Jackie Chan film
in the '80s called Dragon Lord.

1487
01:22:47,788 --> 01:22:52,083
And more along the lines of the idea
that there's a two-on-one fight in that...

1488
01:22:52,084 --> 01:22:54,961
...where the bad guy
just owns them...

1489
01:22:54,962 --> 01:22:58,798
...and he's in total control of the two
fighters that he's faced against.

1490
01:22:58,799 --> 01:23:03,799
I think it was Jackie Chan and Mars
against Whang lng-Sik.

1491
01:23:03,846 --> 01:23:08,641
And Whang lng-Sik is just beating
them relentlessly and pounding them.

1492
01:23:08,642 --> 01:23:13,271
It just takes the dedication of those
two guys to just keep slamming him...

1493
01:23:13,272 --> 01:23:17,108
...and keep crushing him and keep
breaking him until he can't move.

1494
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:20,987
That's one of the things I wanted
to reference with this fight scene...

1495
01:23:20,988 --> 01:23:25,116
...is that we have maybe, like,
more complex choreography...

1496
01:23:25,117 --> 01:23:30,117
...but that same tone, that same type
of atmosphere with the scene then.

1497
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,686
Don't move!

1498
01:23:53,687 --> 01:23:55,563
Drop the gun.

1499
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:58,650
So here is where we're gonna reveal,
like, the sort of--

1500
01:23:58,651 --> 01:24:00,401
We've kind of hinted at it...

1501
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:04,948
...but this is like that moment where
we reveal Wahyu's true colors really...

1502
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:08,034
...and reveal the link
that he has with Tama.

1503
01:24:08,035 --> 01:24:11,246
The fact that, you know,
he's probably in a way...

1504
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:16,247
...worse than any of the bad guys
inside the building.

1505
01:24:17,211 --> 01:24:22,211
Dagu, tie him.

1506
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:43,774
Now you're going to get me
the fuck out of here.

1507
01:24:46,699 --> 01:24:51,699
Amazing.

1508
01:24:57,918 --> 01:24:59,752
So now we go back into the fight.

1509
01:24:59,753 --> 01:25:01,963
We go back into the sort of the--
This is--

1510
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:05,383
This is where the rest of the fight
takes place. We never cut away.

1511
01:25:05,384 --> 01:25:08,761
One of the things we wanted
when it came to designing this fight...

1512
01:25:08,762 --> 01:25:11,598
...was to have this idea
that we don't have moments...

1513
01:25:11,599 --> 01:25:16,561
...where they stop fighting and look at
each other and continue to fight again.

1514
01:25:16,562 --> 01:25:19,981
I wanted it to feel like
when you watch a real fight in a bar...

1515
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:24,611
...it doesn't end until somebody's
on the ground, out cold on the floor.

1516
01:25:24,612 --> 01:25:28,740
That was one of the things we wanted
to do is to have this relentless...

1517
01:25:28,741 --> 01:25:31,200
...aggressive fight
that's constantly going on.

1518
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:33,828
Now, of course, I mean,
it's exaggerated.

1519
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:38,829
Nobody can take this punishment
and last as long as it does.

1520
01:25:38,918 --> 01:25:43,504
But we tried to keep the choreography
grounded in a sense of reality.

1521
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:46,049
We tried to make it
so that all of the movements...

1522
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:51,050
...and all the sort of the attacks and
the exchanges, they're real moves...

1523
01:25:51,263 --> 01:25:53,973
...and they're things you can
relate to as an audience.

1524
01:25:53,974 --> 01:25:58,186
You get this feeling that if you study
the same martial-arts discipline...

1525
01:25:58,187 --> 01:26:00,313
...for long enough,
you could do this too.

1526
01:26:00,314 --> 01:26:04,901
We tend to eschew the idea of having,
like, too many acrobatics involved.

1527
01:26:04,902 --> 01:26:09,697
We kind of keep everything, you know,
as close to realistic as possible...

1528
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:13,368
...so that it's more relatable then.

1529
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:15,411
We're really happy
with some throws...

1530
01:26:15,412 --> 01:26:19,832
...and some of these, like, takedowns
and the sort of, like, flips.

1531
01:26:19,833 --> 01:26:22,752
It took a while to design them,
but it came from a place...

1532
01:26:22,753 --> 01:26:27,753
...of just, like, trying to figure out, like,
basic body movement and momentum.

1533
01:26:27,841 --> 01:26:30,677
And this next one coming up...

1534
01:26:30,678 --> 01:26:34,222
...it came from me
thinking about football...

1535
01:26:34,223 --> 01:26:38,226
...and, like, the idea of when you
kick a ball through somebody's legs.

1536
01:26:38,227 --> 01:26:40,436
It was just that idea
of if you swung your--

1537
01:26:40,437 --> 01:26:43,815
If he lifted his body up and swung
his legs through the gap...

1538
01:26:43,816 --> 01:26:46,734
...that momentum would bring
the person's body forward.

1539
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:51,735
And so, yeah, that was the inspiration
for that kind of movement then.

1540
01:27:04,294 --> 01:27:07,922
I think for this fight as well,
it was one of those where we knew...

1541
01:27:07,923 --> 01:27:11,217
...it was gonna have to get very violent
and very aggressive...

1542
01:27:11,218 --> 01:27:16,218
...and feel like it was relentless
and just they're charging at you.

1543
01:27:16,306 --> 01:27:18,975
You know, its Mad Dog's
final big moment.

1544
01:27:18,976 --> 01:27:21,144
We've kind of built up to this
a long time.

1545
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:25,231
And so when it finally comes, it has to
feel like we're satisfying the audience.

1546
01:27:25,232 --> 01:27:29,318
We have to keep pushing it
and keep going and just, you know...

1547
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:33,281
...create this feeling of the fight
going beyond the realms...

1548
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:35,533
...of how long it could actually last.

1549
01:27:35,534 --> 01:27:38,578
So we start to have moments
with lko falling off frame...

1550
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:43,579
...and showing the exhaustion
in the fighters then.

1551
01:27:54,053 --> 01:27:57,221
So we've come to, like, a certain kind
of symmetry almost then...

1552
01:27:57,222 --> 01:27:58,639
...with Mad Dog...

1553
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,975
...with the idea
just before he killed Jaka...

1554
01:28:00,976 --> 01:28:03,644
...he has that moment
where he kind of--

1555
01:28:03,645 --> 01:28:07,523
Kind of finds sort of, like,
not inner peace in a way, but he--

1556
01:28:07,524 --> 01:28:10,234
There's almost a disappointment
in his eyes then.

1557
01:28:10,235 --> 01:28:13,905
The actual kill blow,
the actual choke hold...

1558
01:28:13,906 --> 01:28:17,575
...like when he killed Jaka earlier,
it was a chore. it was the next step.

1559
01:28:17,576 --> 01:28:19,827
It was something to do
to finish the fight.

1560
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:22,997
But for him in his mind,
the fight is over here.

1561
01:28:22,998 --> 01:28:27,998
And so it's that idea of, like, going over
to kill off Rama, it's just that next step.

1562
01:28:28,087 --> 01:28:30,963
That was the thing. We wanted
to bring that symmetry back.

1563
01:28:30,964 --> 01:28:33,674
So there's a similar feeling
from the previous fight...

1564
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,927
...to get the audience to feel,
"Holy shit."

1565
01:28:35,928 --> 01:28:39,222
That Rama's gonna be in trouble.

1566
01:28:39,223 --> 01:28:42,934
What I tend to love
about this moment here...

1567
01:28:42,935 --> 01:28:47,063
...is that the audience- Normally,
when you have a moment like that...

1568
01:28:47,064 --> 01:28:50,316
...the audience are gonna be
expecting it to be, "That's it.

1569
01:28:50,317 --> 01:28:53,694
That's the end of the fight."
But for us, like, it's not enough.

1570
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:57,949
We can't kill off Mad Dog that easily.
He can't just get stabbed and dies.

1571
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:01,494
So he actually continues to fight
way longer than he probably should.

1572
01:29:01,495 --> 01:29:05,123
And the idea was to kind of take it
to that extreme and to really push it.

1573
01:29:05,124 --> 01:29:08,835
Not just to get the audience to see it
as being a little bit over the top...

1574
01:29:08,836 --> 01:29:12,296
...and a bit ridiculous,
but the idea of, you know--

1575
01:29:12,297 --> 01:29:15,174
Mad Dog is in this position
where he's bleeding to death...

1576
01:29:15,175 --> 01:29:18,010
...and all he cares about now
is still killing these guys.

1577
01:29:18,011 --> 01:29:20,179
So he tries right up
until the last drop...

1578
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:23,307
...that he could kind of maybe, like,
take them with him.

1579
01:29:23,308 --> 01:29:28,308
And unfortunately,
he doesn't get to do it.

1580
01:29:31,859 --> 01:29:36,696
Now, that delightful
little moment there...

1581
01:29:36,697 --> 01:29:39,949
...which is obviously another one
of my mom's favorite scenes...

1582
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:44,950
...actually comes from a scene
at the end of my first film, Footsteps.

1583
01:29:46,039 --> 01:29:50,418
We did a similar sort of effect
where a guy had a knife in his throat...

1584
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:54,755
...then it gets kind of, like, dragged
across to the other side of his neck.

1585
01:29:54,756 --> 01:29:57,216
It was one of those things
where we figured out...

1586
01:29:57,217 --> 01:29:59,302
...what way can we kill Mad Dog?

1587
01:29:59,303 --> 01:30:04,098
How can we take him out and make it,
like, this memorable big final moment?

1588
01:30:04,099 --> 01:30:07,143
And I took a look back
at <i>Footsteps</i> and thought:

1589
01:30:07,144 --> 01:30:09,061
"I can steal that because it's mine."

1590
01:30:09,062 --> 01:30:09,729
So there's no issue
about using that again.

1591
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:12,481
So there's no issue
about using that again.

1592
01:30:12,482 --> 01:30:17,482
We actually shot a close-up
of Mad Dog's face and his neck...

1593
01:30:18,197 --> 01:30:21,365
...while that was happening.

1594
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:24,368
While doing our first take,
immediately it felt too much.

1595
01:30:24,369 --> 01:30:26,913
It felt too violent. it felt too graphic.

1596
01:30:26,914 --> 01:30:30,750
And while I agree, like,
the film is definitely violent...

1597
01:30:30,751 --> 01:30:34,128
...and that moment in particular,
it kind of makes the audience...

1598
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:37,465
...have a very strong
sort of visceral reaction to it...

1599
01:30:37,466 --> 01:30:42,466
...for me, we still kind of show
a certain degree of restraint.

1600
01:30:43,055 --> 01:30:45,765
This shot is a wide profile shot.

1601
01:30:45,766 --> 01:30:47,683
You don't get to see
that much detail.

1602
01:30:47,684 --> 01:30:50,978
It's mostly what it puts in your mind
as you're watching it.

1603
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:53,689
And, like,
throughout the movie before this...

1604
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:57,193
...you know, we're dealing
with moments of violence where--

1605
01:30:57,194 --> 01:31:00,321
It's kind of, like, I didn't wanna linger
on things too much.

1606
01:31:00,322 --> 01:31:04,867
I didn't want to feel like the violence
in the film is exploitative in any way.

1607
01:31:04,868 --> 01:31:08,829
I wanted it to be, like, we hit you hard
in the stomach and then we run off.

1608
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:12,875
So it's like whenever we show
these little outbursts of violence...

1609
01:31:12,876 --> 01:31:15,628
...from shot to shot,
we show something aggressive...

1610
01:31:15,629 --> 01:31:19,340
...and, you know, explicit,
but not repulsive.

1611
01:31:19,341 --> 01:31:23,010
And we cut to the next thing.
We kind of-- We tee up the next shot.

1612
01:31:23,011 --> 01:31:27,265
And that was something that was kind
of important to the film. And I feel like--

1613
01:31:27,266 --> 01:31:31,560
It just teeters on that line.
It's right on the border...

1614
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:35,648
...before it gets too much,
before it gets, like, offensive...

1615
01:31:35,649 --> 01:31:38,442
...in terms of the violence content.

1616
01:31:38,443 --> 01:31:42,238
Because I know who to pay
and more importantly, how much.

1617
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,158
So this was actually probably one
of the most difficult scenes, really...

1618
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:50,162
...in terms of scripting
and in terms of performance as well.

1619
01:31:50,163 --> 01:31:52,832
We're asking them
to give a lot of information...

1620
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:56,502
...at the last few minutes of the film,
which kind of, you know--

1621
01:31:56,503 --> 01:32:01,007
Like, usually, it's kind of that sort
of annoying exposition dialogue...

1622
01:32:01,008 --> 01:32:05,219
...but I wanted it to feel natural. I think
one of the things that helped a lot...

1623
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:09,348
...was definitely Ray
and Pierre's performance here.

1624
01:32:09,349 --> 01:32:10,891
Because it kind of--

1625
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:15,062
It does give across the information
that we need, in terms of the plot.

1626
01:32:15,063 --> 01:32:16,939
But it never feels too forced.

1627
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:21,110
It never feels like he's just giving this
information for no reason whatsoever.

1628
01:32:21,111 --> 01:32:24,947
So it feels like it's come from a place
of aggression and a place of anger.

1629
01:32:24,948 --> 01:32:29,869
And Pierre's sort of, you know,
performance then...

1630
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:34,870
...as he finally kind of realizes his life
is over with and he has no choice left...

1631
01:32:35,459 --> 01:32:37,418
...it fits the scene perfectly then.

1632
01:32:37,419 --> 01:32:39,920
I'm really happy with the work
that they both did.

1633
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:42,798
This was a tough shoot.
This was, like, maybe at the end...

1634
01:32:42,799 --> 01:32:44,633
...of, like, a 16- or 17-hour day...

1635
01:32:44,634 --> 01:32:46,719
...and we still had
to shoot this scene.

1636
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:51,140
This is like-- We were working into
our 19th and 20th hour of the shoot.

1637
01:32:51,141 --> 01:32:54,935
None of us had any energy left, but
they had to kind of raise their game.

1638
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:58,606
They had to kind of find
that inspiration and that energy...

1639
01:32:58,607 --> 01:33:03,607
...in order to kind of get through
a scene, like, this tough then.

1640
01:33:26,927 --> 01:33:28,552
There was always no question...

1641
01:33:28,553 --> 01:33:31,222
...there was no way I would
give Wahyu an easy way out.

1642
01:33:31,223 --> 01:33:34,558
There was no way
we were gonna kill him off. And so--

1643
01:33:34,559 --> 01:33:36,310
Yeah. We kind of actually--

1644
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:39,939
There's a reason why a lot of the
things happen when he has that gun.

1645
01:33:39,940 --> 01:33:42,274
So when he kills that guy
in the corridor...

1646
01:33:42,275 --> 01:33:45,778
...and there's two people in the
corridor, it was so we could get him...

1647
01:33:45,779 --> 01:33:48,531
...to a position
where he would've run out of bullets.

1648
01:33:48,532 --> 01:33:50,574
So assuming he has six
in the chamber...

1649
01:33:50,575 --> 01:33:54,245
...then he kills three people
in the corridor. He shoots Dagu.

1650
01:33:54,246 --> 01:33:57,915
He shoots at Rama in the stairwell...

1651
01:33:57,916 --> 01:34:00,835
...and then he shoots Tama.
And that's his final bullet.

1652
01:34:00,836 --> 01:34:04,713
Actually, the number of people shot
at and the number of bullets fired...

1653
01:34:04,714 --> 01:34:08,592
...we had to carefully think it through
in order to make sure it was...

1654
01:34:08,593 --> 01:34:12,138
...that empty bullet--
Empty gun at the end of the thing.

1655
01:34:12,139 --> 01:34:15,141
<i>Not everyone you salute is rotten.</i>

1656
01:34:15,142 --> 01:34:17,017
<i>Find Bunawar.</i>

1657
01:34:17,018 --> 01:34:18,185
<i>He's a good man.</i>

1658
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,980
So now we're kind of setting up
some characters...

1659
01:34:20,981 --> 01:34:24,024
...that are actually gonna play
an important role...

1660
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:25,609
...in the sequel to this film.

1661
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:30,197
The idea of introducing Bunawar
who we have no idea who he is yet.

1662
01:34:30,198 --> 01:34:33,242
He's actually gonna play a major part
in the sequel.

1663
01:34:33,243 --> 01:34:38,243
So it was interesting to kind of drop
these names at the end of the film...

1664
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:41,292
...without people having
to actually know who they are...

1665
01:34:41,293 --> 01:34:43,919
...but feel like they have importance
in the story.

1666
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,883
And they'll be explored in a lot
more detail now in the sequel.

1667
01:34:48,884 --> 01:34:53,345
One of the things I really wanted to
kind of do with the ending of this film...

1668
01:34:53,346 --> 01:34:58,346
...was not follow the expected route
of a film like this which is, you know...

1669
01:34:58,393 --> 01:35:01,270
...that the brother would go home
with Rama with just--

1670
01:35:01,271 --> 01:35:04,857
That idea of in the perfect world,
that the brother would go home...

1671
01:35:04,858 --> 01:35:07,860
...be a good guy again,
reconcile with the father...

1672
01:35:07,861 --> 01:35:11,780
...and they'd all be having, like, supper
together by the end of the night.

1673
01:35:11,781 --> 01:35:14,074
But for me,
it was always important...

1674
01:35:14,075 --> 01:35:17,745
...that his character exists in this world
because he belongs there.

1675
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:20,623
He feels he's a part of it.
It's something he succeeds at.

1676
01:35:20,624 --> 01:35:22,166
It's something he's good at.

1677
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:25,753
And so that became
an important element then...

1678
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:28,422
...of how the film
was gonna end then.

1679
01:35:28,423 --> 01:35:33,423
And so, like, again, we use that
element of sort of a symmetry then...

1680
01:35:33,553 --> 01:35:37,806
...to the earlier moment when
he tells Rama to change his uniform...

1681
01:35:37,807 --> 01:35:40,059
...and Rama says,
"No. This is who I am."

1682
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:43,979
So this is another moment then where
we get to have Andi tell him then:

1683
01:35:43,980 --> 01:35:46,982
"That might be who you are,
but this is who I am."

1684
01:35:46,983 --> 01:35:51,983
And so they have to separate. They
can't go on the same path together.

1685
01:36:06,086 --> 01:36:10,005
There's a shot coming up here
with lko's face...

1686
01:36:10,006 --> 01:36:12,049
...as he walks out to the building.

1687
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:14,754
And we did a lot
of postproduction work on this...

1688
01:36:14,755 --> 01:36:17,840
...because we were running
out of time on this.

1689
01:36:17,841 --> 01:36:21,469
It was hard to get all this done
in the daylight because in Indonesia...

1690
01:36:21,470 --> 01:36:24,889
...the clouds would form and break
apart every five to 10 minutes.

1691
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:28,935
And so we were playing against
the sunlight on a regular basis on this.

1692
01:36:28,936 --> 01:36:33,564
And the makeup effect on lko's face,
by the time we got this shot right...

1693
01:36:33,565 --> 01:36:37,068
...the makeup wasn't quite right.
So Andi again, my CG guy...

1694
01:36:37,069 --> 01:36:39,904
...he had to make a CG cheekbone
and a CG earlobe.

1695
01:36:39,905 --> 01:36:44,905
And then tidy up the effect as lko turns
and walks away from the film.

1696
01:36:46,245 --> 01:36:49,038
My name's Gareth Evans,
writer and director of The <i>Raid.</i>

1697
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:51,374
I thank you
for listening to the commentary...

1698
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:55,795
...and I hope that everything I've said
has been informative, not too boring.

1699
01:36:55,796 --> 01:36:59,048
Hopefully I'll get to see you
when we do the next film, Berandal...

1700
01:36:59,049 --> 01:37:04,049
...the sequel to The <i>Raid.</i>
