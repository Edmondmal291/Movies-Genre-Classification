1
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,564
Come on, Laurie Anne. It's going to storm.

2
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,081
Hi.

3
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,448
Laurie Anne?

4
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,964
Honey? Don't scare Mama now.

5
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,486
Excuse me. Move along.

6
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,691
Mmm-hmm.

7
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,931
Chief's going to have a cow
when he sees you nosing around, Mike.

8
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,441
Iwon't tell him if you don't.
What you got, Sam?

9
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,001
There's not much left.
Just like the last time.

10
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,162
- Anybody see anything?
- The mother said she saw--

11
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,288
I thought I told you
to stay out of this, Hanlon.

12
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,283
I'm just a concerned citizen, Chief.

13
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,808
And I call six kids missing or dead
a major cause for alarm here.

14
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,201
It may be just a rash of runaways.
Kids get itchy feet.

15
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,886
Right. A five-year-old in a toy car
gets itchy feet.

16
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,691
What, a seven-year-old trots down
to Acapulco for a wild weekend?

17
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,161
The boy's father took him.
The other one...

18
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,845
Chief, there's something terribly wrong
here in Derry. And you know it.

19
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,804
Hey. I'm the cop. You're the librarian.

20
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,961
Okay?

21
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,847
Georgie.

22
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,051
<i>May 2am.</i>

23
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,890
<i>Another killing today.</i>

24
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,525
<i>But this time, there was something more.
Something that makes my skin crawl.</i>

25
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,490
<i>A picture that shouldn 't.</i> ..
<i>No, no, that couldn't have been there.</i>

26
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,607
<i>It's time to tell the others
what's happening.</i>

27
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,569
<i>I can't put it off any longer.</i>

28
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,451
<i>But I hope I'm wrong.</i>

29
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,243
<i>Oh, I hope to God I'm wrong.</i>

30
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,928
<i>Taggert steps onto the moors
as the fog curls around his ankles.</i>

31
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,448
<i>He shivers, buttons his coat,
and walks on, disappearing into the mist.</i>

32
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,364
<i>A shadowy figure Iurches into frame,</i>

33
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,126
<i>dripping with foul water
and dark oozing mud.</i>

34
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,441
Yeah. Yeah.

35
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,928
Bill, for the last time.

36
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,121
In a minute!

37
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,363
That's what you said a half an hour ago.

38
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,046
<i>- And</i> a <i>half hour before that.</i>
- Okay!

39
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,561
Okay.

40
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,804
- It's cold.
- Sorry.

41
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,046
I like the changes, Bill.
They're wonderful.

42
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,802
- I wish you'd tell that idiot, Greco.
- I do. Every day.

43
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,802
You didn't have to
take this job, you know.

44
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,291
It's not as ifwe need the money.

45
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,290
In case you've forgotten,
I took the job to be with you.

46
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,367
Besides, if they're gonna hire somebody
to mangle one of my books,

47
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,521
it might as well be me.

48
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,843
Of course, the idea of actually taking
a vacation didn't even occur--

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,729
So I could hang around the set
with a bunch of actors?

50
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,281
That's not what I do, Audra.
Writing is what I do.

51
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,920
At least when you're doing a novel,
you're in a good mood.

52
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,647
Audra, could we--

53
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,642
I'm asleep, unless it's Greco.

54
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,641
Greco.

55
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,481
Greco.

56
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,441
Yeah?

57
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,683
<i>- Bill, is thatyou?
- Sorry,</i> fella, <i>do</i> I <i>know you?</i>

58
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
<i>This is Mike Han/on, Bill, from Derry.</i>

59
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,411
Swear to me.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,128
Swear to me that if it isn't dead,

61
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,009
we'll all come back.

62
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,608
- Sorry, Mike, for a minute there...
- You <i>didn't</i> know who <i>I</i> was.

63
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,324
For a minute there, I didn't.

64
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,121
<i>Bill,</i>

65
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,566
<i>It's back.</i>

66
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,971
You're... Sure?

67
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,525
<i>Yeah. I found</i> a <i>photograph of George.</i>

68
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,801
George?

69
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,041
What is it?

70
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,210
Who was on the phone?

71
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,204
Nobody. Wrong number.

72
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,761
Bill?

73
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,968
I have to go back to work.

74
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,841
Bill?

75
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,485
Georgie.

76
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,686
Please, Bill. Tell me a story.

77
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,963
Maybe later.

78
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,123
The magic stone story.

79
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,801
Please, Bill. Please.

80
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,081
Go bug somebody else, you little cootie.
I don't feel so hot.

81
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,201
Georgie?

82
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,650
For me? You made it for me?

83
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,005
Can I go sail it?

84
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,366
Oh, well, you have to seal it
first with paraffin.

85
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,482
- What's that? Where is it?
-lt's in the cellar.

86
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,247
I wish you could come, too.
She's your boat, really.

87
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,481
Thanks,BHL

88
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,847
Yuck. You got cooties all over me.

89
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,881
Uh, Georgie.

90
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,011
Don't stay out too long,
or Mom will have a bird.

91
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,086
- I won't.
- Georgie.

92
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,001
Be careful.

93
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,525
Sure. Sure, lwill.

94
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,520
SS Georgie!

95
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,326
Come on, come on!

96
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,722
<i>SS Georgie, out of the way!</i>

97
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,246
No, please, no!

98
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,164
<i>Hi, Georgie.</i>

99
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,962
Aren't you going to say hello?

100
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,686
Oh.

101
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,763
Come on, bucko.

102
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,922
Don't you want a balloon?

103
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,804
I'm not supposed to take stuff
from strangers.

104
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,007
My dad said so.

105
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,725
Very wise of your dad, Georgie.
Very wise indeed.

106
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,765
I, Georgie, am Pennwvise,
the Dancing Clown.

107
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,688
You are Georgie.

108
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,125
So, now we know each other.

109
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,921
Correct?

110
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,845
I guess so.

111
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,610
- L've got to go.
- Go?

112
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,042
Without this?

113
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,886
- My boat!
- Exactly.

114
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,284
Go on, kiddo. Take it.

115
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,241
Oh...

116
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,482
You want it, don't you, Georgie?

117
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,689
<i>Of course you do.</i>

118
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,809
And there's cotton candy and rides
and all sorts of surprises down here.

119
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,005
And balloons, too. All colors.

120
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,365
- Do they float?
- Oh, yes.

121
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,649
They float, Georgie.

122
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,165
They float.

123
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,323
And when you're down here with me,

124
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,960
you float, too!

125
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,248
"Fear no evil for thou art with me,

126
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,727
"thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

127
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,001
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

128
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,131
"Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

129
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,206
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

130
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,842
<i>"And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."</i>

131
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,086
Oh, Georgie.

132
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,561
No.

133
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,401
<i>Billy?</i>

134
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,809
- Billy, are you all right?
- What's wrong, son? What is it?

135
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,606
The picture. Georgie's picture.

136
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,850
Mom, don't you see?

137
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,161
<i>Mom.</i>

138
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,802
- What were you doing in Georgie's room?
- Nothing.

139
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,961
<i>Dad, listen!</i>

140
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,403
I don't want you ever coming
in here again, son. Do you understand?

141
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,604
- Dad.
- I mean it, Bill.

142
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,641
I forgot.

143
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,360
How could I forget?

144
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,604
Leave? Have you lost your mind?
We're in the middle of making a movie.

145
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,684
They can replace me.
This is something I have to do.

146
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,963
Who was that on the phone?

147
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,126
The call was from a guy named Mike Hanlon.

148
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,802
I haven't heard from him in almost
30 years. Not since we were kids.

149
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,205
- Audra. My brother, who died--
- Yes, George.

150
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,645
He didn'tjust die.

151
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,685
He was... Murdered.

152
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,162
- Why didn't you ever--
- Tell you?

153
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,804
Because I forgot. Because I forgot.
Almost as if it never happened.

154
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,962
I know this doesn't make any sense,
but I have to go.

155
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,366
For God's sake, why?

156
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,171
Because we made a... promise.

157
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,401
Why are you stuttering like that?

158
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,006
I don't know.
I used to stutter when I was a kid.

159
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,686
What happened? Tell me.

160
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,690
Damn it, Bill, talk to me! Let me help.

161
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,011
- If you're going back, I'm going, too.
- Don't even think that!

162
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,050
- Why not? You're scaring me.
- You promise me you'll stay here.

163
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,565
- Promise me!
- You're crazy.

164
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,041
- This is crazy.
- Pro--

165
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,725
It's just crazy.

166
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,562
I love you.

167
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,606
- Oops.
- Oh, no, Ben.

168
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,207
Your architect award.
And you just received it. It's a tragedy.

169
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,449
Yeah, honey.
We've got ourselves a real tragedy here.

170
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,046
This is an American tragedy.

171
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,921
Oh, look at this.
Would you hang on to this?

172
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,289
I got this, and this, all right.

173
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,768
- Okay.
- Come on.

174
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,921
Here you are, my good man. Recycle.

175
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,890
Here, wait a minute.
I got my magic, uh, opener.

176
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,450
Come on, honey.

177
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,804
Oh! Limbo! How low can you go?

178
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,126
BENZ Whoo!

179
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,442
No, no, no. You don't have to be quiet.

180
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,207
- Is, is all this yours?
- Uh-huh. Come on in.

181
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,402
Here, let me see what I can do with this.

182
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,761
- Oh...
- Oops.

183
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,650
It's so nice.

184
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,924
Come here, beautiful. Come on.

185
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,450
God, look at you!

186
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,330
Ooh

187
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,924
- I love your body.
- Ooh, I like yours, too.

188
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,523
- Would you believe I used to be fat?
- I bet you were real cute.

189
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,365
No, notjust fat,
but a regular butterball.

190
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,806
You bet your fern I was.

191
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,525
We used to say that as kids.

192
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,849
You bet your fern, but I was F-A-T.

193
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,685
- No.
- Yeah.

194
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,326
I hear bells. I'll be right back.

195
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,161
Hello?

196
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,970
<i>Haystack, it's me, Mike.</i>

197
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,087
<i><i>You're dead, fat boy.</i>

198
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,969
It's payback time, piggy.

199
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,044
<i><i>You're gonna die, fat boy.</i>

200
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,201
<i>Hey, fat boy!</i>

201
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,361
Ben?

202
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,885
<i>Ben, are you there?</i>

203
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,721
<i>- Mike?
- Yeah, buddy. Listen.</i>

204
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
<i>- It... It's come back.</i>

205
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,249
<i>How much do you remember?</i>

206
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,882
<i>How much do you remember?</i>

207
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,447
Very little. Almost nothing.

208
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,284
<i>Will you come?</i>

209
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,805
I'll come.

210
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,046
Are you okay?

211
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,485
I don't think I am, sweetheart.
Not tonight. Not at all.

212
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,570
Are you gonna kill yourself?

213
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,246
No, I don't think so.
Though it might be better if I did.

214
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,930
<i><i>My name is Ben Hanscom.</i>

215
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,563
Until last week,
I lived with my mom in Houston, Texas.

216
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,488
<i>We moved here to live with my cousins.</i>

217
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,085
Look at that gut.

218
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,681
Go on, Ben.

219
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,885
Have you any hobbies?

220
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,360
Well, I like to read a lot.

221
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,601
<i>Especially about old civilizations,
the Egyptians, the Indians.</i>

222
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,925
We have a wonderful library here, Ben.
Welcome to Derry.

223
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,122
- Thank you, Miss Douglas.
- Oink, oink.

224
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,961
What a porker.

225
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,045
Henry Bowers,

226
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,204
you will stay for one hour after school
every day this week.

227
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,885
My father will tan my hide.

228
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,566
You should've thought of that
before you picked on Ben.

229
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,882
<i>Now, report to the principal's office.</i>

230
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,081
You're dead, fat boy.

231
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,881
Boy. It's going to be
some funeral, friend.

232
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,885
Now, class,

233
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,451
as you know, the sheriff
has instituted a 7:00 p.m. curfew.

234
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,001
<i>We live in dangerous times,
boys and girls.</i>

235
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,561
<i>I want you to be careful.</i>

236
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,804
Like this place so well
you're going to stand there all day?

237
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,961
School's over, you know.

238
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,248
- Excuse us, please.
- Can we get through?

239
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,761
Honestly, Loni, some people have no class.

240
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,922
Some people have janitors for parents.

241
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,130
Well, so long, Ben Hanscom.

242
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,364
I'm Beverly Marsh.

243
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,608
Well, see you tomorrow, Beverly Marsh.

244
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,402
Beverly Marsh. Beverly Marsh.
Beverly Marsh. Beverly Marsh.

245
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,727
- Hey, look, it's the fat boy.
- Top of the day, fat boy.

246
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,407
- What do you want?
- I want to teach you something, porky.

247
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,766
You like to learn new things, don't you?

248
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,084
Mmm-hmm.

249
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,090
I want to make sure you remember my name.

250
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,005
I'll remember, Henry. I'll remember.

251
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,770
How am I gonna make sure? Huh?

252
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,401
Hey, Henry.

253
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,720
Come on, don't really cut him.

254
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,251
Cut him? Huh?

255
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,201
Cut him?

256
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,568
Let's see, first comes...

257
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,761
Oh, God!

258
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,889
<i>You're going to die! You're dead!
I'm gonna bury you!</i>

259
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,530
You're going to die!

260
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,843
<i>I'm gonna bury you!</i>

261
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,204
<i>Nobody kicks me, porky!</i>

262
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,006
<i>- Nobody kicks me! Nobody!
- Come on, fat boy.</i>

263
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,645
<i>You better run, boy.</i>

264
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,325
<i>You're going to die, man!</i>

265
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,683
<i>Come on, let's get him!
You're dead, fat pig!</i>

266
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,560
<i>Hey, what's this?</i>

267
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,802
<i>Looks like</i>
a <i>geek wading pool to me.</i>

268
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,768
So what are you two girls
doing down here?

269
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,322
Hey, look at the dam,
a stupid little baby dam.

270
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,961
You didn't have to do that.
Why did you do that?

271
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,009
'Cause I felt like it. Give me that.

272
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,170
- That's for my asthma.
- Oh, is that a fact, sissy?

273
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,566
- Leave him alone.
- Shut up, you little creep.

274
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,246
I said stop that,

275
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,927
<i>or I'll pull your ears down
and tie them underneath your chin.</i>

276
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,448
- You seen a fat kid run by here?
- No.

277
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,046
<i>- Big, fat kid, all messed up.
<i>- No.</i>

278
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,249
<i>You sure, mush-mouth?
You better be sure.</i>

279
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,970
I'm sure.

280
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,761
Let's go.

281
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,291
Ta-ta, girls.

282
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,491
Oh, no.

283
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,611
It's empty-

284
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,162
I can't breathe.

285
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,771
Are they gone?

286
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,411
Yes. Look, can you stay here
with my friend

287
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,130
while I go get his medicine?

288
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,441
Yeah.

289
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,011
Here. Eddie, it's okay.

290
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,646
Take it easy, kid. You'll be okay.

291
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,522
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah?

292
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,923
What are we gonna do if...
They come back?

293
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,361
Want some?

294
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,804
- My dad, he died of the big
-"The big 'C"'?

295
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
Cancer. I was just a little kid.

296
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,843
Yeah, my dad died, too.
He was shot down in Korea.

297
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,489
- Remember him much?
- Sort of, lthink.

298
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,608
- So, who's the other guy?
- Bill?

299
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,600
Bill's my best friend.
He's a really great guy.

300
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,481
<i>Hey!</i>

301
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,081
I'm

302
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,841
back.

303
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,843
- Does he always stutter that much?
-lt's worse since his kid brother died.

304
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,365
Some guy killed George.

305
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,251
Pulled one of his arms right off,
just like a wing off a fly.

306
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,481
That's awful.

307
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,166
Ijust told you because
if you want Bill to be your friend,

308
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,129
it's better not to talk to him
about George.

309
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,204
- He's all messed up about it.
- Man, lwould be, too.

310
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,843
- "Would be, too," what?
- Oh, nothing. Thanks.

311
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,041
Yeah.

312
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,281
Thanks for staying.

313
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,885
Jeez. He's really got it bad.

314
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,442
I was scared he's going to
slip into a coma like on Dr. Kildare.

315
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,731
- Me, too. You're Ben.
- Yeah, and you're Bill.

316
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,602
- Yeah, and this is...
- Eddie. He knows.

317
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,604
I hate it when you stutter my name, Bill.
You sound like Elmer Fudd.

318
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,807
Sorry.

319
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,601
No, no, no. No, Elmer Fudd has a lisp.
It's Porky Pig that stutters.

320
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,285
Okay, 0K8)'-

321
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,562
- Why don't you come back tomorrow?
- Yeah.

322
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,408
Me and Eddie, we're trying to make a dam.

323
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,405
Well, you gotta have some boards.

324
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,881
You get boards and you put them in a row,
facing each other.

325
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,890
- Like the bread of a sandwich and then--
- But we--

326
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,566
Huh?

327
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,725
- But we do it.
- Oh, yeah, "we."

328
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,086
- What are you doing, coz?
- Just something for school.

329
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,287
Let's see.

330
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,126
- Ooh. A poem.
- That's private.

331
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,930
"Your hair is winter fire.

332
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,129
"January embers."

333
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,363
Hey, Mom, listen to this, Benny's in love!

334
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,567
Give this back.

335
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,367
- Oh, Mom! Mom!
- Stop that! Benjamin!

336
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,445
Hanscom, stop that immediately,
you young ruffian!

337
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,601
I hate you!

338
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,804
You're only here because
Mom says it's our Christian duty.

339
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,641
<i><i>Nobody's ever going to say</i>
a <i>sister of mine is on welfare.</i>

340
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,007
So you're welcome here
as long as you need to stay.

341
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,481
But I have to say
you're spoiling the boy, Arlene.

342
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,483
You need a firm hand, discipline.

343
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,086
We'll have a home of our own
one day, Benny. I promise.

344
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,571
I know, Mama.

345
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,801
Benny, as long as we're guests
in this house, I need you to help me.

346
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,851
They wouldn't treat us like this
if Daddy were still alive.

347
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,331
Come on inside now and apologize.

348
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,811
Apologize? But he was--

349
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,090
- Benny, You must!
- No! I hate it here. I hate it here.

350
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,765
Benny, come on. Benny.

351
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,845
<i>Benny!</i>

352
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,250
<i>Ben! Benny! Up here, Ben.</i>

353
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,881
Daddy?

354
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,961
<i>Benny!</i>

355
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,081
<i>Ben!</i>

356
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,121
<i>Ben!</i>

357
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,881
<i>Hi, Ben.</i>

358
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,487
Daddy?

359
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,808
That's my home now, son.

360
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,125
Do you want a balloon, Ben?

361
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,290
They float.

362
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,241
They all float.

363
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,370
Come here, son. You'll like it down there.

364
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,366
You'll never have to grow up.

365
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,609
They float.

366
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,808
They all float.

367
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,247
And when you're down here with me,

368
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,605
<i>fat boy, you'll float, too.</i>

369
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,040
Please.

370
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,242
Please, stop.

371
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,570
Beverly By Hand. One moment, please.

372
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,805
Miss Marsh's office.

373
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,323
Hold a moment, please.

374
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,642
Bev, someone calling from Maine,
says it's important.

375
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,801
Maine?

376
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,043
- Pam, I said no calls until--
- We've got a minute. I'll take it.

377
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,051
No. Get their number and close the door.

378
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,209
Your hands are shaking.

379
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,171
I'm scared to death, Tom.

380
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,289
That stuff spreads like cancer.
I won't have it around.

381
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,081
Ah.

382
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,687
There. That's perfect. Don't touch it.

383
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,041
Listen to me, Bevy.

384
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,962
We've got a bunch
of well-heeled Japanese gentlemen

385
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,565
waiting for us downstairs.

386
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,007
We're gonna show 'em around.

387
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,891
You're gonna play
the charming flamboyant designer.

388
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,405
We're gonna sit down, make a deal,

389
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,166
I'm gonna play hardball,
and when it's over, we're gonna be rich.

390
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,371
If you get a hold of yourself right now.

391
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,965
- Do you understand?
- Mmm-hmm.

392
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,205
Okay. Kiss for good luck?

393
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,447
Okay, let's go.

394
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,321
And Bevy, don't ever contradict me
in front of Pam again, okay?

395
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,841
Okay.

396
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,167
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'm Beverly Marsh.

397
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,243
This is my partner, Tom Rogan.

398
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,451
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Beverly, it's Mike Han/on.</i>

399
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,921
<i>- Who?
- Mike Han/on. Remember me?</i>

400
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,761
Mike Hanlon. Of course I remember.
How are you?

401
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,729
<i>Fine. Look, are you sitting down?</i>

402
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,485
There you are.

403
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,327
Whoa.

404
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,211
Who was on the phone?

405
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,801
I know you're going to think
this is crazy...

406
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,724
I certainly think it's crazy,

407
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,484
but I've gotta go to Maine.

408
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,764
It's... It's hard to explain. Um...

409
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,449
That was Mike Hanlon on the phone.
You remember the call at work today?

410
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,364
He's an old, dear friend. I have to--

411
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,251
Shut up! That's what you have to do,
just shut up!

412
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,482
The very day I make a deal
of a lifetime for you,

413
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,768
<i>you wanna run off to Maine
with some old boyfriend?</i>

414
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,849
What do you take me for?

415
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,727
Oh, boy. I've seen this coming.

416
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,443
Oh, yes. You've forgotten
your manners, little girl.

417
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,844
Contradicting me here,
smarting off there, and now this.

418
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,522
You've forgotten your lessons, Bevy.

419
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,762
It's been too long since last time.

420
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,770
Put that thing down.

421
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,522
I have to get out to O'Hare
as fast as I can.

422
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,207
There's some trouble,
some very bad trouble.

423
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,849
<i>It's come back, Beverly.
It's come back. Remember your promise.</i>

424
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,522
- Put these clothes back.
- No.

425
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,523
- You get into bed!
- No!

426
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,884
Then maybe you can
leave this house in two days--

427
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,849
- No!
-...Instead of two weeks.

428
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,766
Not ever, ever, ever again!

429
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,326
Listen to me. If you ever come
near me again, I will kill you.

430
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,201
Do you understand? lwill kill you.

431
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,844
Bev, you need me!

432
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,725
Bev!

433
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,926
O'Hare, please.

434
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,241
What airline, miss?

435
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,562
Uh...

436
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,083
I, uh, I need to go to Maine.

437
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,925
All right. We'll find one
that goes to Maine.

438
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,809
What's in Maine? Family?

439
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,130
Fﬂends.

440
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,764
The best I ever had.

441
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,284
Daddy, breakfast is ready.

442
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,280
I'll get it.

443
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,969
"Your hair is winter fire.

444
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,651
"January embers.

445
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,768
"My heart burns there, too."

446
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,649
Who was that at the door, Bevy?

447
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,805
- What do you got there?
- Nothing.

448
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,961
Let me see that.

449
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,086
You been doing something you shouldn't?

450
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,609
You been fooling around with some boy?
Poetry from some boy?

451
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,564
I worry about you a lot, Bevy.

452
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,320
- Sometimes, I worry a lot.
- Daddy, please.

453
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,528
Not even 12
and already running with some boy.

454
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,324
Let me alone, you just let me alone!

455
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,481
Come here!

456
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,683
Don't make me go over there
and collect you. You come to me.

457
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,841
No.

458
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,810
- What did you say?
- I said no!

459
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,887
You get right the hell back here, Bevy!

460
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,402
And in front of God,
I'll whip the skin off of you!

461
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,321
Hi.

462
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,361
I'm sorry if I scared you. Are you okay?

463
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,967
Yeah.

464
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,564
Haven't you got anything better to do
than go sneaking up on people?

465
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,851
- Sorry.
- You should be.

466
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,805
Well, lwas thinking,
it being Saturday and all,

467
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,803
and if you didn't have
anything better to do,

468
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,883
you could come down with me
to the barrens.

469
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,531
The barrens?

470
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,645
This is Eddie,

471
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,765
<i>and this is Bill.</i>

472
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,526
Hi.

473
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,605
Hi.

474
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,562
Do you guys know each other already?

475
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,891
Well, Bev wants to help. I hope it's okay.
I mean, she's a girl.

476
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,241
Sure.

477
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,525
Hey, what's this? By George, Martha,

478
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,409
it's the river Nile.

479
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,285
And four, count them, four sphinxes.

480
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,721
Richie.

481
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,884
You were expecting maybe Gunga Din?

482
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,250
That's Richie. He can drive you
to the bughouse and back, but he's okay.

483
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,604
I heard that, you skirt. Hi, Bill.
How you doin', Eddie Spaghetti?

484
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,607
Don't do that. I hate it when you do that.
And don't call me "Eddie Spaghetti."

485
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,526
Oh, you love it, Eddie.
It's what makes you so chuck-a-licious.

486
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,721
Richie Tozier's my name.

487
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,568
And doing voices is my game.
This is Stan "the Man" Uris.

488
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,485
Stannie's a Jew, which means
he's really smart and says "oy" a lot.

489
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,803
Richie's got a high metabolism,
and it tends to make him hyperactive.

490
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,050
So you, um, Haystack,
what, are you building a dam or something?

491
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,247
Yeah.

492
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,204
- You ever built one before?
- No.

493
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,647
How do you know it'll work?

494
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,646
- Well, of course it will. Why wouldn't it?
- Yeah, but how do you know?

495
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,801
Ijust know.

496
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,803
- Yeah, he just knows.
- Yeah.

497
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

498
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,361
VVeH,okay.

499
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,367
- You're a genius, Haystack.
- Oh, it's not so much.

500
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,205
- Yes, it is. It's great.
- We stopped that sucker cold!

501
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,361
- Yeah.
-lt's great.

502
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,727
We could flood out the whole barrens
ifwe wanted to.

503
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,769
We did it! We!

504
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,843
- Yes!
- Yeah! Yeah!

505
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,682
Listen, I'll go this way.

506
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,606
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile.

507
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,725
- See you, Ben.
- Yeah, see you, Bill.

508
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,450
Hi yo, Silver. Away!

509

My heart burns there, too.

Now explain yourself!

531
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,923
There was a spider.
A big, fat spider.

532
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,403
It crawled out of the drain,
and I guess it crawled back down again.

533
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,363
Now, these buildings are old,

Ah.

Eddie, this isn't like you.
Tell me where you're going.

Eddie?

00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,242
Tell me who was on the phone. Answer me.

559
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,966
Answer me.

560
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,681
Mom, please, please. Don't cry, okay?

561
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,128
Eddie, you're scaring me so bad,
you've got to tell me.

00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,241
Eddie.

Eddie.

- Where are you going? Derry?
-l've gotta go back to Derry.

565
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,125
Why would you want to go back
to that dirty little town?

566
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,284
There's nothing for you there.
There never was, Eddie.

Please, Ma. Please.

- Jeez, Eddie.

570
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,687
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

571
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,888
- You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Move it!

Joey, I'm sorry
to be leaving you holding the bag.

574
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,484
Do we have enough drivers
lined up for next week?

575
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,641
It's covered, Eddie.

576
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,280
All right, lwant you to do
the Pacino job yourself.

577
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,204
Remember, he likes the Lincoln stretch.

578
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,562
I know, Eddie.
The business is under control.

579
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,801
Great.

580
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,089
- It's you I'm worried about. Yeah?
- I'm fine.

581
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,480
So where are we going?

582
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,562
Penn Station. The 11:30 to Boston.

583
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,687
They saw me.

584
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,529
- We-- We better go.
-l'm a dead man.

585
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,411
If I were you guys,
I wouldn't pay to see a monster movie,

586
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,846
I'd just stay home and look in a mirror.

587
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,081
BENZ Richie!

588
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,125
Let's get out of here!

589
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,611
Yeah, let's go!

590
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,369
- Oh, did you see those guys?
- I saw you make it worse.

591
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,443
Oh, come on, Eddie Spaghetti.

592
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,888
- It was just a joke.
- Sometimes you joke too much.

593
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,651
Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta
make jokes, or you die of boredom.

594
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,168
- I mean, are we men or are we mice?
- We're mice!

595
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,288
Then let's act like mice.

596
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,561
Oh, look.

597
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,763
That place scares me green.
I think it's haunted.

598
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,363
Honestly, Eddie, such things
just aren't empirically possible.

599
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,369
In English, ain't no such thing.

600
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,201
You know, you're a pretty swift guy
for a girl, my little chickadee.

601
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,325
Why, Richie Tozier, was that a compliment?
On our very first date?

602
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,960
0n...

603
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,810
How come Richie's so special?

604
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,043
Well, the date wasn'tjust with him,
Eddie dear. I love you, too.

605
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,845
- Ooh.
- Ew.

606
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,482
Hey, don't trip!

607
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,330
Whoa!

608
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,767
You know, Eddie,
it's been great, but see you later.

609
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,610
- See you later.
- Bye, Eddie.

610
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,243
I wish this summer would never end.
It's the best summer of my whole life.

611
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,845
MRS. KASPBRAKI Eddie.

612
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,408
Eddie Kaspbrak,

613
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,164
I was worried sick.
I almost called the police.

614
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,607
- Eddie was with us, Mrs.--
- Go away.

615
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,367
<i>Go home.</i>

616
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,444
Ma, these are my friends.

617
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,524
- See you tomorrow, Eddie.
- Eddie has to rest tomorrow.

618
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,884
I don't want you to play with them
anymore. No good will come of it.

619
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,041
But, Ma, they're my friends.

620
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,965
You don't need any friends, Eddie,
except for your own ma.

621
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,043
- You <i>feel</i> warm.
- I'm fine.

622
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,568
<i>No gym and no showers
with the other boys this week.</i>

623
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,563
<i>- I don't want you catching their germs.</i>

624
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,010
All right, you guys, quit that running,
this is a hallway, not a track! Come on!

625
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,170
- Did you take a shower, Kaspbrak?
- No, sir.

626
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,609
Now look, I'm gonna explain this to you
only one more time.

627
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,242
You take phys ed, you sweat,
you take a shower. Got it?

628
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,290
<i>PENNYWISEI It's okay, Eddie.</i>

629
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,048
<i>Hi. I just wanted to say hello.</i>

630
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,046
Hot enough for you up there, is it?

631
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,004
This is a little inconvenient, Eddie.

632
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,091
<i>Just hold on
while I make</i> a <i>few adjustments.</i>

633
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,690
Here I am, wheezy.

634
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,729
Hey. You're gonna like it down here.

635
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,130
Won't do any good to run, girly boy.

636
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,411
See you in your dreams.
Oh, come back anytime.

637
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,210
Bring your friends.

638
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,645
So <i>I say,</i> "Go ahead,

639
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,729
"make my day."

640
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,402
<i>And the next thing you know,
I'm feeling my way to the toilet.</i>

641
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,961
<i>I mean, how much power
does the electric company have, huh?</i>

642
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,043
<i>How much power does the electric company--</i>

643
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,247
<i>Remember Godzilla ?</i>

644
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,926
<i>I mean,</i> a <i>plane couldn't stop him,
the atom bomb couldn't stop him,</i>

645
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,686
<i>hell, Nancy Reagan couldn't stop him.</i>

646
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,764
<i>But you get him in front of
one high power line...</i>

647
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,370
<i>Look, look!
The creature is attacking the city.</i>

648
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,121
You guys are great!
Good night! Good night!

649
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,281
Bobby!

650
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,047
Hey, hey, guys!

651
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,686
Thank you!

652
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,001
Beautiful!

653
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,401
I don't know. That
political material is getting real old.

654
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,689
Who the hell knows Betty Ford?
We've got to work on this, man.

655
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,561
We've got to work on--
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh.

656
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,487
There she is. Hey.
How's my favorite niece?

657
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,491
I'm so glad you made it.
I want to see Miller first thing Monday.

658
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,801
First thing Monday,
I want to see Miller, okay?

659
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,007
- I've got it arranged.
- Okay?

660
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,288
If I'm host...
Listen. If I'm hosting next week,

661
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,891
I've got to have that new material.

662
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,650
I've got somebody you've got to meet.

663
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,802
- I can't tell you-- Okay.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

664
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,645
Buona sera.

665
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,724
Yeah, this is Richie Tozier.
Who's this, Elvis?

666
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,325
<i>- Mike</i> Han/on.
- Who?

667
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,761
Who?

668
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,486
<i>Mike Han/on, from Derry. Do you remember?</i>

669
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,291
Yeah. Sure, I remember you, pally.

670
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,481
What about subbing for Carson
on Monday night?

671
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,842
Who's going to sit behind the desk
and make funny?

672
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,446
- Let Leno do it, ldon't care.
- Richie!

673
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,687
What am I going to tell them?

674
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,969
You tell 'em whatever you have
to tell 'em, Nat! I need a couple of days.

675
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,360
Couple of days for what?

676
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,245
The reunion of your Cub Scout pack
at Grover's Corners?

677
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,284
Come on, boychik, what is it?

678
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,645
A broad? The mob?

679
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,604
I don't know what it is.

680
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,843
Now, don't insult my intelligence.

681
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,526
I made a promise.

682
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,007
We've been through a lot together, Rich.

683
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,003
You're doing fine. You can handle this.

684
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,481
<i>No, this can't be happening!</i>

685
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,721
Help!

686
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,962
Oh, God. Help!

687
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,531
<i>Help! Help!</i>

688
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,048
<i>They felt its breath,
hot and horrible, against their faces.</i>

689
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,807
<i>But at that moment, they released
the stones and ran out of the cave.</i>

690
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,769
<i>And now, they were back home,</i>

691
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,843
but nothing could change
the way they felt.

692
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,128
They had learned to be strong together.

693
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,601
They had beaten the dragon
with their magic stones,

694
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,285
and nothing would ever be the same again.

695
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,243
You gotta write that one down, Bill.
That's my favorite.

696
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,966
- Really excellent.
- Beautiful.

697
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,284
Yeah, Bill's going to leave
this one-horse town and meet Sandra Dee

698
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,966
and all the other babes in Hollwvood.

699
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,120
Dream on, Richie.
I'm not sure I want to grow up at all.

700
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,770
Well, I do. lwant to be
a train conductor and see the world.

701
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,731
That is if your mom
ever lets you cross the street.

702
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,400
I want to be
the first rock 'n' roll singer from Derry.

703
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,800
Either that or an impressionist.

704
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,644
Your voices all sound the same, Richie.

705
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,450
Thanks a bunch, professor.

706
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,768
- How about you, Bev?
- A painter, maybe.

707
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,809
My dad's been teaching me how to draw.

708
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,851
Fighter pilot. When I'm old enough,
I'm gonna join the Air Force.

709
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,570
An ornithologist.

710
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,121
I like cataloging things
and finding their logical order.

711
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,123
Can I tell you guys something?

712
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,644
If you guys laugh, I'll never--

713
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,961
YOUNG BENZ We won't, will We?

714
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,121
N0.

715
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,486
The other night, in Georgie's room--

716
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,291
<i>What on earth? For the love of Mike!</i>

717
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,444
Look at this mess. The saints preserve us.

718
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,126
Officer Nell.

719
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,841
Don't "Officer Nell" me. You're fixing
to back flood all the drains in town

720
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,766
- Whose brainstorm was this, eh?
- I showed them how, it's my fault.

721
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,285
It was my idea.

722
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,726
- Me, too.
- Yeah, lwas in on it, too.

723
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,881
And me.

724
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,010
- I suppose it was your idea, too, lass?
- Yes.

725
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,845
Now listen to rne, all of you.
There's been another murder.

726
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,007
- Little Velma Daniels.
- Velma Daniels?

727
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,766
Her poor body was found this morning
down by the canal.

728
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,001
So, if you come down here to play,

729
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,168
come together like you are now.
Understand?

730
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,361
That means together, all the time.

731
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,841
Your hands on it?

732
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,326
So what do you think
Bill was going to tell us yesterday?

733
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,803
I don't know.
He's been acting awful moody lately.

734
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,001
In fact, they all have.

735
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,402
Of course, with this food,
who can blame them?

736
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,601
Well, hey.

737
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,647
- Larry, Curly and Moe.
- Beep, beep, Richie!

738
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,041
All right, twerp. Who threw it, huh?

739
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,368
Was it you? lt was you, wasn't it?

740
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,769
Tell me. And you might live
through this, four-eyes.

741
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,522
At the Paramount theater, who did it?

742
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,886
Hey, way to go, banana-heels.

743
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,081
Tozier!

744
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,321
Bowers!

745
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,968
Go downstairs and get a mop
from Mr. Marsh and clean this up!

746
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,401
Go on!

747
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,481
Mr. Marsh?

748
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,121
Mr. Marsh?

749
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,169
Great. Just great.

750
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,527
Yoo-hoo. Mr. Marsh, you down here?

751
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,728
Probably drunk as a skunk.

752
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,286
Mr. Marsh?

753
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,361
<i>Mr. Marsh?</i>

754
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,841
Uh, Mr. Marsh,

755
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,364
I had a little accident in the cafeteria.

756
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,450
No, this... This isn't happening.

757
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,001
Help!

758
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,681
Oh, God, help!

759
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,130
"Beep, beep, Richie"!

760
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,405
Come back, anytime!

761
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,684
I'll show you how to float down here.

762
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:29,131
They all float down here.

763
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,401
<i>Help!</i>

764
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,280
You've got to help me. Somebody, please.

765
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,685
In the basement, there's a werewolf.

766
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,646
Stop him.

767
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,330
<i>I remember the day
I took that photo,</i>

768
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,284
<i>one of the best days of my life.</i>

769
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,285
<i>We were lucky that summer,</i>

770
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,966
<i>lucky we didn't get
our fool selves killed.</i>

771
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,691
<i>Or maybe there was something
more than luck at work.</i>

772
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,003
<i>If so, I hope it returns when they do.</i>

773
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,241
Lucky seven.

774
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,449
<i>Ibrought this
old photo album from home.</i>

775
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,046
My dad was stationed in Derry
during World War ll,

776
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,562
and he started collecting these old photos
that go way back to the olden days.

777
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,290
Who'd want a history of this toilet?

778
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,523
Henry, how many years
will you be in here with me?

779
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,920
<i>Continue, Michael.</i>

780
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,764
This is the old ironworks.

781
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,009
One Sunday, back in 1930,
there was an Easter egg hunt here.

782
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,004
But the ironworks exploded
and all these people got killed.

783
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,122
<i>This is the Derry Standpipe.
It supplied all the water to the town</i>

784
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,687
<i>until</i> a <i>big disaster back in 1900.</i>

785
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,405
Maybe the biggest mystery
is how 253 settlers

786
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,369
just disappeared without a trace.

787
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,211
Thank you, Michael, for that illuminating,
if somewhat morbid, history.

788
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,206
Now, who's next?

789
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,121
Howdy, partner.

790
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,930
- Give it here.
-"Give it here."

791
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,282
Or what, boy? Or what?

792
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,209
The nigger here lives down the street
from me and my daddy, isn't that so?

793
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:11,441
Give it here.

794
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:17,283
You've been giving me and my daddy
grief for a long, long time.

795
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,131
You like fireworks, boy?

796
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,401
Huh?

797
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,605
What do you say
to a rocket in your pocket?

798
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,681
Hey, you!

799
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:33,247
Stop that right now.

800
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,561
Get him!

801
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,520
<i>I'mjust glad I'm not
the only one who saw something.</i>

802
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,251
It wasn't a clown at first.
It was a werewolf.

803
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,880
I didn't see a werewolf.
Just a clown.

804
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,203
Don't you see

805
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,724
it was a werewolf for Richie
because he saw that dumb movie.

806
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,609
But it was a clown underneath.

807
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,843
So, maybe it's some kind of evil being
that can read our minds

808
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,571
and take the shape of stuff
we're afraid of.

809
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,370
And that's what happened
to all the kids around here?

810
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,925
Pfft. Get serious.

811
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,761
Come on, come on!

812
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,924
Why didn't any of us say anything?

813
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,965
Personally, lthought
you guys would think I was nuts.

814
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,522
Me, too. I thought it was just me.

815
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,767
You're not alone.

816
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,321
Such a thing
just isn't empirically possible.

817
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:40,404
Real. It was so real.

818
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,489
Yeah, Stan, it almost had
my guts for garters.

819
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,563
Probablyjust the influence of the movie.

820
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,485
Couldn't it be just some crazy guy
dressed up in a clown suit?

821
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,687
N0.

822
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:54,289
It's some kind of monster,
and it's right here in Derry.

823
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,370
<i>I'm going to bury you!</i>

824
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,166
God, Henry Bowers.

825
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,327
We better get out of here.

826
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,442
- Dummy up. All of you. Rocks.
- Rocks?

827
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,329
Rocks. Ammo.

828
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:28,370
Help me. Please, help me.

829
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,681
You're dead!

830
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,965
Well, what do you know?

831
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,607
It's the fat boy, the Jew and the sissy.

832
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,088
<i>Four-eyes and the patch girl, too.</i>

833
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,085
<i>Nigger, you know how to pick them.</i>

834
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,043
The loser's club.

835
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,083
Yeah, yeah, the loser's club.

836
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,049
I got bones to pick with you,

837
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,202
but I'm willing to let that go for today.

838
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,402
Today, lwant him. So buzz off.

839
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,766
Why don't you guys get out of here?

840
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,044
- Who's going to make me?
- We are.

841
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,241
What did you say, chubs?

842
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,209
Hey, dig the wax
out of your ears, barf breath.

843
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,567
You're through... Bowers.
Get out!

844
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,882
You stuttering freak.

845
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,731
You're going to get a surprise.
You're going to get such a surprise!

846
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,526
Come on, Bowers!

847
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,961
Ow!

848
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,445
RU". Henry!

849
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,451
Come on!

850
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,927
Ow!

851
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,081
Get out.

852
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,241
What if I won't?

853
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:17,047
I think the six of us
could put you in the hospital.

854
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,601
Seven.

855
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,164
I'll kill you all.

856
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,290
Get some new material, champ.

857
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,045
I'll kill you all!

858
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:45,480
I'll kill you all!

859
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:48,721
Thanks.

860
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,441
Anytime.

861
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,330
Who are you guys anWVaY?

862
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,410
We're sort of a club.

863
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,923
Yeah, the Loser's Club.

864
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,481
Yeah.

865
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,603
You want in?

866
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,488
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

867
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,927
Hey, we're seven now.

868
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,447
Lucky seven.

869
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,529
Hey, wait a second.

870
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,286
Camera.

871
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,928
<i>My dad says there's no way
to date this one.</i>

872
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,005
He says it's probably
from the early or mid-1700s,

873
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:43,366
when Derry was a logging town.

874
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,521
Hold this.

875
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,522
- Pennwvise the Clown?
- That's him.

876
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,681
That's him!

877
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,528
Two hundred years ago? He was here then?

878
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,160
Come on! lt'sjust a...
It's just a drawing.

879
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,361
Now look.

880
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,170
Here he is again.

881
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,846
The same man.

882
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,281
It's not a man.

883
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,527
It.

884
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:04,807
It!

885
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,881
That's what happened
back in Georgie's room.

886
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,001
<i>Look!</i>

887

I'll drive you crazy,
and I'll kill you all.

889

Yes.

Yeah, yeah.
That's what I wanted, you turkey.

-"Do"? What do you mean "do"?

Bev's right.
We've gotta do something.

We got a letter from Mom today.

She asked when we were going to
make her a grandma.

I was just thinking the same thing myself.

<i>Well, I was, really.</i>

Yeah, and one of them

01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,125
I swear.

1101
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,766
I swear.

1102
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,885
I swear it.

1103
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,164
Yeah, I swear.

1104
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,489
I swear, too.

1105
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:21,961
I swear.

1106
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,810
Swear.

1107
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,320
Stannie?

1108
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,047
I'm coming upstairs to scrub your back

1109
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,444
and your chest.

1110
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,406
And...

1111
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,451
Stanley?

1112
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:03,691
Stanley?

1113
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,166
Stan?

1114
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,846
Here you go.

1115
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,282
- You sure you don't want me to wait?
- No, thanks, I'll walk back.

1116
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,767
Georgie.

1117
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,523
How could I have forgotten?

1118
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,730
I'm so sorry.

1119
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:54,845
Take your pick...

1120
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,409
Billy-boy.

1121
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:00,881
0m

1122
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:04,087
Except for the one on the end.

1123
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,610
That's already taken.

1124
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,247
<i>Sorry.</i>

1125
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,970
I remember you.

1126
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,448
<i>And I remember we beat you.</i>

1127
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,850
I'm not afraid of you.

1128
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,330
I'm not afraid of you.

1129
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,564
I know how old I look.

1130
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,842
It's just that I remember you as a kid.

1131
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,049
Welcome home, Bill.

1132
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,962
I only wish it was under happier...

1133
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,569
Come on, let's go out.

1134
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,561
It occurred to me in there
that I didn't create any more paranoia

1135
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,006
than we already have here.

1136
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,049
I got a taste of it myself, earlier.

1137
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,363
At least people seem to care now.

1138
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,249
Or maybe it's just that
I'm a grown-up now.

1139
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,524
I feel so thick, Mike.

1140
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,682
I don't remember much of it at all,
what we did.

1141
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:00,768
I don't even remember why I came back,
except for Georgie.

1142
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:03,966
I'll bet it doesn't all come back at once.

1143
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,651
How come you remember?

1144
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,683
I never left, how could I forget?

1145
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:10,724
All I do is look on the street corner
and there we were. Seven of us.

1146
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,086
Lucky seven.

1147
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,083
Oh, man, thatjust came back.

1148
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,441
Something else.

1149
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,163
- One of us lived around here.
- Right.

1150
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,921
Bev!

1151
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:24,525
Right down the street.

1152
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,601
Her father...

1153
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,764
She was poor. Her father was the janitor.
This was Poor Town.

1154
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,686
Yeah, still is.

1155
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,321
Yours?

1156
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,849
Hey, I'm a bachelor, Bill.
It's all I need.

1157
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,122
It's clean and better yet, it's paid for.

1158
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,761
Feeling hungry?

1159
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,287
Frankly, I haven't had an appetite
since you called.

1160
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,284
I've arranged
dinner tonight for all of us.

1161
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,165
Have you seen any of the others?

1162
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,291
No. But I've had a feeling all afternoon

1163
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:06,002
I could tell whenever one of us hit town.
I don't think we're all here, yet.

1164
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,487
No.

1165
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,321
You, too?

1166
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,809
Whatever it is, it's powerful stuff.

1167
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:15,130
Well, here's to remembering.

1168
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:19,841
What?

1169
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:24,449
Maybe this will stimulate
those old memory banks a little.

1170
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,166
Silver.

1171
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,921
Yep, I ran across it in the pawn shop
about a year ago.

1172
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,004
I don't know, something made me buy it.

1173
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,329
It's got a flat tire,
but that's all that's wrong with it.

1174
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:42,444
But here's the real kicker.

1175
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:47,810
I bought this tube repair kit on impulse.

1176
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,241
About three months before I saw this bike.

1177
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:56,763
There was some kind of force
guiding us that summer.

1178
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,969
I don't know if it came just to help us
or if we created it.

1179
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:02,607
<i>But maybe it's still here.</i>

1180
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:06,051
I'm going to change clothes.

1181
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:46,323
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

1182
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,131
Not the Paramount, you slimeballs!

1183
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,131
<i>Where are the people of this city
supposed to get their culture?</i>

1184
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,491
- May I help you?
- Mike Hanlon.

1185
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,529
He stepped out a short while ago.

1186
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:14,242
- L'm pretty sure he's coming back.
- Good.

1187
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:19,404
Uh... I'm gonna sit here
and I'm gonna wait here for him.

1188
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:22,762
Come on, Tozier, get a grip.

1189
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:29,125
You look like you could use this.
It's just water.

1190
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,327
Thank you.

1191
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:43,005
<i>A little young for you,
isn't she, Richie?</i>

1192
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,243
<i>Beep, beep, Richie.</i>

1193
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,090
I didn't hear that.

1194
01:40:48,440 --> 01:40:49,566
I didn't!

1195
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,810
I beg your pardon?

1196
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,089
<i>PENNYWISEI Come On up, Richie!</i>

1197
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,650
I got a balloon for you.

1198
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:00,364
Don't you want a balloon?

1199
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,721
What's the matter, one balloon not enough?

1200
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,043
Try a bunch!

1201
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,931
ls everything all right?

1202
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,009
- Yes--
- Last chance, Tozier.

1203
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,925
Get out before it gets dark tonight.

1204
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:44,006
You're too old to stop me.

1205
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:46,322
You're all too old.

1206
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,921
- Tell Mike Hanlon if you see him--
- Excuse me, sir.

1207
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:52,886
Do you have Prince Albert in a can?

1208
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:54,246
You do?

1209
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,130
Well, you better let the poor guy out.

1210
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,209
Tell Mike Hanlon that I had to go.

1211
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:04,450
That I had to get cleaned up. Tell him.

1212
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,485
<i>Tell him.</i>

1213
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,127
Tell him I'll see him tonight.

1214
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,281
Get out!

1215
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,922
<i>Last chance, Tozier. Get out!</i>

1216
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,282
<i>Get out while you can.</i>

1217
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,728
<i>Excuse me, ma 'am.</i>

1218
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,089
<i>Is your refrigerator running? It is?</i>

1219
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,490
<i>Well, you better catch it
before it runs</i> away.

1220
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,761
MIKE; Whoa!

1221
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,201
Whoa!

1222
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,442
All right!

1223
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:32,321
Son ofa gun.

1224
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,611
Not just any cards, Bicycle.

1225
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:38,483
They always made the best noise.

1226
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,646
Bill?

1227
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:55,481
I see it.

1228
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:06,204
<i>All right, you follow up on this
Miller thing. I'll call Todd myself.</i>

1229
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,761
What about the engineer's report?

1230
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:10,081
What's that?

1231
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:14,926
You're breaking up, Fran.
I'll call you from the hotel.

1232
01:44:26,440 --> 01:44:27,805
Pull over here, will you?

1233
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,560
Wait for me.

1234
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,567
You're it! You're it!

1235
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,402
- You're dead, fat boy.
- Come on!

1236
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,211
You're going to die!

1237
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,805
- Yeah!
- Get him!

1238
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,402
<i>You're dead! You're dead!</i>

1239
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,125
Run, fat boy!

1240
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:25,081
- You're it, porky.
- You're it!

1241
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,286
- Have a nice trip.
- See you later, porky.

1242
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:40,046
- Hey, you okay, buddy?
- My knee.

1243
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,761
Lucky for me you have that hankie thing.

1244
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:56,806
Be prepared.
Here, why don't you just keep it?

1245
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:00,524
I think I'll be okay now.

1246
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:03,291
Hang tough, champ. You're gonna make it.

1247
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:08,124
Ben Hanscom!

1248
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,482
<i>It's nice to see you again.</i>

1249
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,641
<i>What have you been up to all these years?</i>

1250
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,605
We can't wait
to get you down here with us.

1251
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:33,444
You're in my mind. Only in my mind.

1252
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,482
Any spare change, mister?

1253
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:49,240
Hey, who walked all over your grave?

1254
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:52,008
I wasn't going to hurt you.

1255
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:53,920
I don't even know you.

1256
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:58,847
Let's go.

1257
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,328
- Derry Inn, did you say?
- Yeah.

1258
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,882
Reliving your childhood down there?

1259
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:14,765
Something like that. Just saying hi
to some old ghosts, you know.

1260
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,762
Oh, hell. Time does go by.

1261
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:57,680
<i>Here's that prescription.</i>

1262
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,646
How old are you now, son?

1263
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:03,609
Eleven. Almost 12.

1264
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:07,041
Old enough. Come with me.

1265
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:10,241
Come on.

1266
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,961
Relax, Eddie. I'm not gonna bite you.

1267
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:23,921
Now, most of your troubles come from
you being so tight and stiff all the time.

1268
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:26,441
You take your asthma, for instance.

1269
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,602
Do you know what a placebo is, Eddie?

1270
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,281
I got to go.

1271
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,567
It's water, Eddie.

1272
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:37,206
Water with a squirt of camphor
to make it taste like medicine.

1273
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:38,401
No.

1274
01:48:38,640 --> 01:48:41,849
Your doctor is weak and your mother
is determined that you're ill.

1275
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,923
And you, my friend,
are caught in the middle.

1276
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:48,405
It's all a lie, a great big lie!
I do have asthma. I do!

1277
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,926
Sir?

1278
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:55,645
Your prescription.

1279
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:03,009
Nothing like a good pull
on the old lung-sucker, huh?

1280
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,641
Thank you.

1281
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:09,487
Junior, <i>bring</i> me a cigar.

1282
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,484
You know you can't have one, Granddad.

1283
01:49:14,240 --> 01:49:15,446
Mr. Keene?

1284
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,808
Mr. Keene. Hello.

1285
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:25,282
Cigar for the old man?

1286
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,289
I'm sorry. I don't have any.

1287
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,569
I'm Eddie Kaspbrak, Sonia Kaspbrak's son.

1288
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:33,243
How about some licorice?

1289
01:49:33,680 --> 01:49:36,081
I was always partial to licorice.

1290
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,571
Mr. Keene, ljust wanted to thank you

1291
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,206
for trying to tell me the truth
a long time ago.

1292
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,965
You look a little peaked, sonny.

1293
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:55,841
I'd better go.

1294
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:57,240
Hyd rox.

1295
01:49:58,400 --> 01:49:59,401
What?

1296
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,888
H20.

1297
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,601
Water.

1298
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:07,288
<i>It's only water.</i>

1299
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,327
It's all in your head, sonny.

1300
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:13,602
You do remember me.

1301
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:14,841
Oh, Mr. Keene...

1302
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:17,931
Mr. Keene?

1303
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:21,522
Get out of Derry while you still can.

1304
01:50:21,880 --> 01:50:23,530
Mr. Keene, please.

1305
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:26,122
Beware, little Eddie.

1306
01:50:26,360 --> 01:50:29,125
Beware, girly-boy.

1307
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,048
No cigar, sonny.

1308
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:39,730
<i>I was always partial to licorice.</i>

1309
01:51:19,240 --> 01:51:22,084
I'm sorry, I must have rung the
wrong bell. lwas looking for Marsh.

1310
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:23,321
- Marsh?
- Yes.

1311
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,000
There's no Marsh here. Unless...

1312
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,684
You don't mean Alvin Marsh?

1313
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:30,571
Yes, my father.

1314
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,325
Oh, Miss...

1315
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:35,121
I hate to be the one to have
to tell you this, a stranger,

1316
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,408
but your father's been dead
this last five years.

1317
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:39,766
But on the bell...

1318
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:43,721
Oh...

1319
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:46,442
Kersh. I thought it said "Marsh."

1320
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,645
I'm Mrs. Kersh.
I knew your father a little.

1321
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,885
- Come in. Let me give you tea.
- No, lcouldn't.

1322
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:56,408
You could and you will. I insist.

1323
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,290
Feel free to look around.

1324
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,447
Perhaps you'd like to freshen up?

1325
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,209
<i>Did you fall
asleep in there? It's teatime.</i>

1326
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:58,691
Tea.

1327
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:00,685
Tea would be nice.

1328
01:53:02,160 --> 01:53:04,128
I love what you've done with the place.

1329
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:06,886
It's so different, so cozy.

1330
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,844
How kind you are, miss.

1331
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:12,204
I call all the pretty young girls "Miss".
Don't take offense.

1332
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:13,761
No.

1333
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:26,045
Well, go on, dear,
drink it while it's nice and hot.

1334
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:42,642
Don't trouble your
pretty little head, dear.

1335
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,285
I'll get it.

1336
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:47,042
It did say "Marsh" on the doorbell.

1337
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:50,081
If you're wise, you'll run, dear, run.

1338
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,921
Because to stay will mean
worse than your death.

1339
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:54,889
They float down there.

1340
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,321
<i>They float.</i>

1341
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,643
I worry about you, Bevy. I worry a lot.

1342
01:54:06,040 --> 01:54:08,327
It won't do you any good to run, Bevy.

1343
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,764
You're not real! You're not real!

1344
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:19,281
Beep,beep!

1345
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,209
<i>I told you the first time
you introduced me to him</i>

1346
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:14,850
<i>that he was</i> a <i>twit, Audra.</i>

1347
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,001
<i>Do you remember?</i>

1348
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,844
Greco, I didn't ask you over
to insult Bill.

1349
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,480
- How dare he do this to me.
- Come on.

1350
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:23,041
You've been complaining about him
ever since we started this picture.

1351
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,760
He'll never work in movies again.
I suppose you know that.

1352
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:29,841
If you could have seen his face.
It was frightening.

1353
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:34,611
Nothing like a little crisis to bring
the estranged couple closer together, eh?

1354
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:38,604
Or perhaps pull them farther apart,
if the gods are smiling.

1355
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:39,887
Greco, please.

1356
01:55:40,120 --> 01:55:44,125
I'm simply pointing out that this
could be a blessing in disguise.

1357
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,361
Would you consider giving me a few days?

1358
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:51,285
I shall pretend I didn't hear that, Audra.

1359
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,323
I can replace your imbecilic husband.
I cannot replace you.

1360
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,249
Don't even think about leaving, Audra.

1361
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:03,084
<i>You've worked very hard
to get where you are. Very hard.</i>

1362
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:05,562
I know you'd do nothing
to jeopardize that.

1363
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:09,123
Or to damage
our professional relationship.

1364
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:11,968
Or to turn a friend overnight
into a violent enemy,

1365
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:14,202
ready to crucify you at any cost.

1366
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:20,449
But there's no need to talk about that.

1367
01:56:23,120 --> 01:56:24,770
See you tomorrow.

1368
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:44,242
International reservations, please.

1369
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:48,282
Yes, I'd like a seat on your next
flight to the United States.

1370
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:11,926
Excuse me,
I'm looking for the Hanlon party.

1371
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,291
- Eddie?
- Ben?

1372
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,961
- Eddie Kaspbrak.
- Haystack!

1373
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:23,211
- What happened to the rest of you?
- Gone but not forgotten.

1374
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,401
Hey. buddy!

1375
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:28,687
Oh, my God.

1376
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:33,322
Where's Richie Tozier
when you need a good line?

1377
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,887
- Ben?
-l'm afraid so, Bill.

1378
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:38,202
I can't believe it. Look at you.
Hey, Bill.

1379
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:40,801
- Hey.
- Michael, God.

1380
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,600
- Mike, is that you?
- Such as I am, Haystack.

1381
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,404
Hey, listen. Who wants a drink?

1382
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,290
- Set them up.
-l'll have one.

1383
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,010
<i>- What is this?</i>
<i>- That's my dog.</i>

1384
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:56,640
<i>- I'll have</i> a <i>club soda, okay?</i>
<i>- This is pretty good.</i>

1385
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:05,725
Come on, Tozier, don't let them
see you like this, get a grip, man.

1386
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,968
That was a hallucination.
lt was a flashback deal.

1387
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:10,327
It was too much fun in '67.
Just get ahold.

1388
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,206
You're working too hard, kid.

1389
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,680
Jeez, you 9W5-

1390
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,524
I got a toast. I propose--

1391
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:19,762
All right, who got bald, who got wrinkled,

1392
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:21,843
and how many of God's children got wings?

1393
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,604
- Beep, beep, Richie!
- Richie!

1394
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,410
- Richie, beep, beep.
- Mike, hey!

1395
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,321
- Hey, buddy, how are you?
- Fine, fine. You?

1396
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,041
Beverly?

1397
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:36,727
What a bunch of handsome old men.

1398
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,441
EDDIE; Oh!

1399
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,251
Hi, good-looking.

1400
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:55,722
Oh, Richie.

1401
01:58:56,200 --> 01:58:57,201
Oh...

1402
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,686
Eddie!

1403
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,242
I'd rather catch you than anybody else
in the whole world, Beverly Marsh.

1404
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:07,441
Oh...

1405
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:11,246
I just saw all of you standing there

1406
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:14,085
and so much came flooding back,
it was like a tidal wave.

1407
01:59:14,640 --> 01:59:17,371
Oh, Mike.
What are we getting ourselves into?

1408
01:59:20,680 --> 01:59:22,045
- Hi, Bev.
- BEVERLYI Hey.

1409
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,922
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1410
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:28,887
Where's...

1411
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:42,965
Are you all right, Bev?

1412
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:45,441
Yes.

1413
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:47,886
No. I...

1414
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:51,284
I saw something today.

1415
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,524
- Same with me.
- Oh, man!

1416
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:56,804
- What I saw at the library, whoa--
- Was it Pennwvise?

1417
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,283
With both barrels, it was Pennwvise.

1418
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:00,726
He's working on us already.

1419
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:03,446
- Trying to chip away.
- Maybe that means he's afraid.

1420
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:05,762
It. It's afraid.

1421
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:07,485
Oh, man. It!

1422
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,770
Help us remember, Mike.
Help us fill in the gaps.

1423
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,487
Yeah, please, because I don't know
what you are guys talking about.

1424
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:21,289
I can't remember much of anything
and when I try, it kind of clouds over.

1425
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:24,525
I mean, didn't you feel it?

1426
02:00:24,960 --> 02:00:26,644
<i>As soon as I crossed the county line,</i>

1427
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:29,565
it was like this veil
dropped over my eyes.

1428
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,571
Maybe it's the water.

1429
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,163
The water? Maybe it's the sewer.

1430
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,042
This is battery acid, you slime!

1431
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,564
- Eddie!
- Take a breath, man. Breathe.

1432
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:51,731
I'm okay.

1433
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,731
I think I remember who Pennwvise was now.

1434
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,526
Big white guy, red nose,

1435
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:01,761
about 75 feet tall,
mouth full of razor sharp teeth.

1436
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:04,530
Oh, Eddie.

1437
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:10,768
What the hell is happening, you guys?

1438
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:13,249
What is going on?

1439
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:20,124
I'm sorry.
It was just a very vivid memory.

1440
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,322
I had forgotten that I stared
that creep right in the face.

1441
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,530
And you saved Stan's life.
You remember that part?

1442
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:29,361
Yeah.

1443
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,806
Yeah, now I do.

1444
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:34,885
Hey, speaking of Stan. Stan? Stan!

1445
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:37,090
Where is his royal straightness anwvay?

1446
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:38,401
He wouldn't fink out on us,
would he, Mike?

1447
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:39,726
You talked to him, right?

1448
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,405
Yeah, I think he'll be along.

1449
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:44,650
I think we ought to go ahead without him.
When he gets here, we can fill him in.

1450
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,410
Come on, Mike, talk to us,
help us remember.

1451
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:48,403
No. Wait a minute.
I don't know about you guys,

1452
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,722
but this is the first time
since I got here that I feel good.

1453
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:53,486
I mean, I feel halfway safe. Come on.

1454
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:55,326
Let's have a couple of drinks,

1455
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:57,847
chew on some good food,
have a couple of chucks.

1456
02:01:58,000 --> 02:01:59,206
And let'sjust leave
the wolf out the door.

1457
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,482
Spoken like a real loser, Richie.

1458
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:03,688
Hey, to the Loser's Club.

1459
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:06,571
- All right!
- To the Loser's Club.

1460
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,485
Talking about your wives?

1461
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:24,041
How many times have you been
to the altar, Richie?

1462
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:27,044
Four or five.
Who the hell keeps count?

1463
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:29,123
Women all want the same thing.
No offense, Bev.

1464
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:32,921
None taken, creep.
Welcome to the fourth century.

1465
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:34,411
What about you, Ben, you married?

1466
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,484
Nope, I've dodged the bullet
a number of times, now.

1467
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:39,284
- How about you, Eddie?
- Me?

1468
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,287
Yeah, I'm seeing this
really wonderful woman,

1469
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:44,920
but with the business and all,
I really don't have too much time.

1470
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:48,841
You take it from me, spaghetti man,
better dead than wed.

1471
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:51,082
Any little crumb
snatchers for you, Richie?

1472
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:52,526
None that I know of.

1473
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:54,684
- How about you, <i>Bev?</i>
- What?

1474
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,648
- How about you?
- Oh, uh...

1475
02:03:58,280 --> 02:03:59,520
Well, I live with a--

1476
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,964
No, I'm not married.

1477
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:05,681
Richie, what ever happened
to those glasses?

1478
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:06,961
Contact lenses.

1479
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:10,409
Richie, for the number of times
you broke those glasses of yours,

1480
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:13,570
you should have had stock in
an adhesive tape company.

1481
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,524
Me and Henry Bowers.

1482
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:20,247
Somebody please tell me
he was hit by a freight train

1483
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:21,731
and put out of his misery.

1484
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:25,009
No such luck. You wanna see Henry Bowers
you'll find him up at Juniper Hills.

1485
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:28,562
Ever since the trial, where he confessed
to all the murders of all the children.

1486
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:31,803
- He was down there with us in the sewers.
- That creep was gonna kill Stan.

1487
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:33,405
He was going to kill us all.

1488
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:36,723
I remember when they pulled him out,
his hair had turned white.

1489
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:39,360
- He was babbling about a bright light.
- And a clown.

1490
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:41,010
And no one believed him.

1491
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:42,725
Except when he said
he killed all the kids.

1492
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,565
- And we didn't say anything.
- Not</i> a word.

1493
02:04:46,360 --> 02:04:49,569
But lt was the killer and we stopped lt.

1494
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,731
We thought we did.

1495
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,081
PENNYWISEI Henry.

1496
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,765
<i>Henry Bowers.</i>

1497
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,928
Up here, sharp stuff.

1498
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,481
<i>UP here!</i>

1499
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:19,807
You helped me once. Remember?

1500
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:21,924
You chased those brats.

1501
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:24,924
Almost got them, Henry. Almost.

1502
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:27,285
Don't you want another chance?

1503
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:31,331
<i>You've got to go back and finish the job.</i>

1504
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:34,770
<i>You've got to go back to Derry
and kill them all.</i>

1505
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:36,962
<i>For me, Henry.</i>

1506
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:38,965
<i>Kill them all.</i>

1507
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,442
Henry, kill them all.

1508
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:46,049
Kill them all. Kill them all.

1509
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,440
Kill them all.

1510
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,642
Kill them all!

1511
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:55,128
Well, sports fans,
this has been a real hoot,

1512
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,649
but I got a plane out at 6:00 a.m.

1513
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:58,926
Richie, you're not leaving?

1514
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:01,162
Bev, girl, what do you want, an adventure?

1515
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:03,525
<i>You got some high-toned idea</i>

1516
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:05,489
<i>that you're gonna go relive
that old nightmare?</i>

1517
02:06:05,640 --> 02:06:07,642
I love you, but count me out.

1518
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:09,484
I'm going to a hotel.
I'm gonna get some sleep,

1519
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:13,167
and in the morning, I get on a plane
and I'm out of here forever.

1520
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:16,006
- I will remember all of you very fondly.
- Richie?

1521
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:18,488
Hey, man, we're all scared.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1522
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:20,369
Maybe he's right.

1523
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:25,131
I mean, if you are talking about
going back into the sewer?

1524
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,520
<i>We don't know
what we're talking about yet</i>

1525
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,324
mainly because we haven't talked
about it yet.

1526
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:30,801
Yeah, suppose we give Mike
a chance to fill us in

1527
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,325
<i>before we scatter to the four winds.</i>

1528
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:33,686
Or is that too much trouble, Richie?

1529
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:35,763
All I'm saying is I'm gonna
go get some sleep.

1530
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,126
Is that too much to ask?

1531
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,010
Why don't we show Michael
a little courtesy--

1532
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:40,730
Guys! Guys, come, on!

1533
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,167
It's all right, Ben.
If Richie wants to go, he goes.

1534
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:46,091
Now, we all came here based
on the strength of a promise.

1535
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:49,609
As far as I'm concerned, everybody at
this table made good on that promise.

1536
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:51,524
Wherever we go from here,

1537
02:06:52,240 --> 02:06:54,129
I have no expectations.

1538
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,570
Well said, Michael.

1539
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,450
It's all right.
It's taken care of, Richie.

1540
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:00,649
No, you can't do that.

1541
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:02,530
Guys, that's just the way it is.

1542
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,490
All right, then.
A toast to Mr. Michael Hanlon.

1543
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,804
<i>A man without whom none of this
would have been necessary.</i>

1544
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,246
I can see my fortune now,

1545
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:17,086
"You're gonna be eaten by a big,
greasy monster. Have a nice day."

1546
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,361
Dummy up, everybody.

1547
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:57,244
What is it? What's wrong?
ls something the matter?

1548
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:01,368
Our friend had an asthma attack,
but he's better now.

1549
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:05,121
I'm much better. Thank you. Thank you.

1550
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:07,084
Everything was okay?

1551
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:10,329
<i>- Everything was fine, thank you.</i>
<i>- Very fine. Thank you, Rose.</i>

1552
02:08:18,160 --> 02:08:21,050
Guys, I'm not so sleepy anymore.

1553
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:23,486
Let's get the hell out of here.

1554
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:39,770
ls this the Uris residence?

1555
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:43,807
<i>Is Stan there?
This is Mike Han/on, an old friend.</i>

1556
02:08:45,320 --> 02:08:47,448
What are we supposed to do now?

1557
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:49,131
Hey, spaghetti man, no problem.

1558
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,926
A little soap, a little elbow grease
ought to clean it right up.

1559
02:09:09,560 --> 02:09:12,564
<i>Why are we the only ones
that can see this?</i>

1560
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:17,523
Well now, there you've got me stumped.
Let's ask the answer man. Oh, Mike?

1561
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,131
Oh, Michel...

1562
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:22,281
Garg:on?

1563
02:09:22,520 --> 02:09:24,761
Hold on just a sec. Hello, Stan?

1564
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:26,565
Mike Hanlon.

1565
02:09:26,760 --> 02:09:29,445
Is this the Uris residence?
I'm trying to get ahold of Stan Uris.

1566
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:33,486
You tell that loser that if he hasn't
left already, he's a dead man.

1567
02:09:33,640 --> 02:09:35,210
We all managed to show up.

1568
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:37,488
Boy, that matches your real hair.
Has anyone ever told you...

1569
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,604
ls anyone from out of town?

1570
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:42,847
I don't know about you.
ljust flew in from LA, boy, and...

1571
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:44,530
<i>Boy, is my tail section tired.</i>

1572
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,730
Yeah, not a chance. We're hot tonight.

1573
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:51,367
It's great to be back in Derry,
breathing in that old Derry air.

1574
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:55,282
<i>I have never felt so much love in one
room in my entire life.</i>

1575
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:56,966
Eddie, get all their names

1576
02:09:57,120 --> 02:09:58,485
I wanna put them on my Christmas mailer.

1577
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:01,843
No, Denbrough there, let's put him
on my Norman Mailer!

1578
02:10:04,080 --> 02:10:07,562
I love this man.
He's like the brother I never had.

1579
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:10,047
Wait a minute.
He is the brother I never had.

1580
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:12,403
Beep, beep, Richie. Stan?

1581
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:23,726
Thank you.

1582
02:10:27,160 --> 02:10:28,241
Stan is dead.

1583
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:42,089
He cut his wrists in the bathtub
right after I phoned him.

1584
02:11:10,280 --> 02:11:12,965
Stan was the last one of us to see lt
that summer.

1585
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,001
Remember?

1586
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:18,881
All summer long he kept saying,
"Thatjust isn't empirically possible."

1587
02:11:20,440 --> 02:11:22,966
Even seeing the clown
didn't make it real for him.

1588
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:24,487
Nothing did.

1589
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:27,122
<i>Until that afternoon in August.</i>

1590
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:36,929
<i>I remember
I was coming down Chestnut Street</i>

1591
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:40,408
<i>and I saw Stan running through the park
like something was after him.</i>

1592
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:42,481
YOUNG STAN LEYI G0!

1593
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:45,724
- Go!
- Hi yo, Silver. Away!

1594
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:48,643
<i>I can't honestly say
I saw anything that day.</i>

1595
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,484
<i>Stan's the one who saw it.</i>

1596
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:56,643
<i>I was pedaling too fast to turn around.
I didn't want to see it. Whatever it was.</i>

1597
02:11:57,400 --> 02:12:00,370
<i>It took him hours to calm down enough
to tell me what happened.</i>

1598
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,002
<i>He said he was down
in Lampkin Park by</i> a <i>bird feeder.</i>

1599
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,285
<i>Watching birds.</i>

1600
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:09,643
<i>Like</i> a <i>good Boy Scout.</i>

1601
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,161
<i>Remember? He used to call it
"collecting birds</i>

1602
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:22,684
<i>PENNYWISEI Stan...</i>

1603
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:26,686
<i>Stan...</i>

1604
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:41,370
<i>He said he didn't mean
to go into that house,</i>

1605
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:45,564
<i>but this voice kept whispering to him.</i>

1606
02:12:46,160 --> 02:12:50,006
<i>And naturally, being Stan, he figured
there was a rational explanation.</i>

1607
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,047
Hello?

1608
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:57,485
PENNYWISEI Stanley.

1609
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,566
Yeah? I'm right here.

1610
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:32,691
He was trapped.

1611
02:13:32,840 --> 02:13:34,251
<i>The only thing he could think of to do</i>

1612
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,681
<i>was to hold his bird book out
in front of him like</i> a <i>shield</i>

1613
02:13:36,840 --> 02:13:39,605
<i>and say as loud as he could the names
of all the birds he could remember.</i>

1614
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:40,921
Longneck finch...

1615
02:13:41,720 --> 02:13:43,563
Speckled grouse, Baltimore oriole...

1616
02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:49,649
Great egret, hammerhead Woodpecker
and brown thrush.

1617
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:54,006
Brown thrush.

1618
02:13:55,600 --> 02:13:57,807
The day that we went into the sewer

1619
02:13:58,640 --> 02:14:00,130
Stan saw lt.

1620
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:03,090
Face to face.

1621
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:09,649
Not the clown,
but he saw what was behind the clown.

1622
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:14,850
He ran up to me in school and he said,

1623
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,963
"l saw It, Eddie.

1624
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:21,003
"L looked right into its..."

1625
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:24,010
Some kind of lights.

1626
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:29,122
"L looked right into its deadlights."

1627
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:33,162
Then he said,

1628
02:14:33,320 --> 02:14:36,802
and I hadn't thought of it until just now,
I swear, he said,

1629
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:40,761
"l looked into its deadlights
and I wanted to be there."

1630
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:42,326
Deadlights.

1631
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:57,566
- I need a drink.
- Yeah, me, too.

1632
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,006
I'm sure I've got something here.
Anybody else?

1633
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:02,201
Yeah.

1634
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:12,041
Stan!

1635
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:14,680
Sorry, I'm late.
Well, let's see who's here.

1636
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,206
Billy-boy!

1637
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:22,890
Richie, you still here?
We never expected you to stick around.

1638
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:25,327
Nice nose job. No one would ever suspect.

1639
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:28,121
Haystack, putting on a little weight, huh?

1640
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:31,046
Speaking of dads, Bevy,
yours isn't worried about you anymore.

1641
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:32,611
<i>He loves your choice in men.</i>

1642
02:15:33,040 --> 02:15:36,123
Wheezy, how's your sex life?
What's your sex life?

1643
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:38,724
Well, Mikey, you did it.
You got us all back here.

1644
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:41,008
<i>I guess it's 'cause it's
the only way you'd ever see us</i>

1645
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:43,686
<i>since you're so lame
you'd never leave this town.</i>

1646
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:47,009
I finally made it, guys.
I'm in the deadlights now.

1647
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:49,567
<i>And you know what?
It's true what they say.</i>

1648
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:52,644
We all float down here and you will, too.

1649
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:55,770
In fact, they all float!

1650
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:58,561
They all float!

1651
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:20,686
My God!

1652
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:58,567
All right.

1653
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:01,525
I don't know about the rest of you,
I'm getting real sick of this place.

1654
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:06,124
Now I'll listen to anything anybody has to
say, but could we do it someplace else?

1655
02:17:06,360 --> 02:17:07,441
Please!

1656
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,171
Okay. Just help me with the stuff.

1657
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:17,806
Bill.

1658
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:19,526
What is it?

1659
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:25,045
"He thrusts his..."

1660
02:17:29,160 --> 02:17:33,165
"He thrusts his fists against the post
and still insists he see the ghosts."

1661
02:17:33,560 --> 02:17:35,403
That's all it says over and over
and over again.

1662
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:40,046
My mom gave me that to say

1663
02:17:41,800 --> 02:17:45,043
to help with my stutter.

1664
02:17:49,560 --> 02:17:51,642
No offense, pal, it ain't helping.

1665
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,851
Let's get the hell out of here.
What do you say?

1666
02:18:22,200 --> 02:18:23,281
Henry!

1667
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,281
Down here.

1668
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,928
Belch? What are you doing down there?

1669
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:38,963
You got a problem in there
you need some help with, Henry?

1670
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:44,644
That's a good boy.

1671
02:18:48,120 --> 02:18:49,929
<i>You don't
have to talk out loud, Henry.</i>

1672
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:53,568
I can hear you when you just think it
and they can't hear me at all.

1673
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:56,930
<i>- What</i> do you want?
- Same thing you want.

1674
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:58,771
I want to pay them back.

1675
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,931
<i>Yeah, pay them back.</i>

1676
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:04,090
But you're gonna have to get out of here.

1677
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:05,810
You're gonna have to go back to Derry.

1678
02:19:08,080 --> 02:19:11,641
I need you,
Henry. We all need you.

1679
02:19:12,640 --> 02:19:14,085
<i>They can't hurt you.</i>

1680
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:17,330
We didn't think they could hurt us back
then either, but they did, didn't they?

1681
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:20,366
<i>- Bested you all summer.
- Don't talk about that.</i>

1682
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:23,604
I can take care of them
if they only half believe.

1683
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:26,123
But you, you're alive, Henry.

1684
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:28,125
You can get them
no matter if they believe,

1685
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:30,601
half believe or don't believe at all.

1686
02:19:31,720 --> 02:19:34,451
One by one, Henry.

1687
02:19:34,600 --> 02:19:36,125
<i>I can't get out of here.</i>

1688
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:39,085
<i>They got wires on the windows,</i>

1689
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:43,528
<i>and Koontz is on the door tonight.
Man, Koontz is the worst.</i>

1690
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,207
<i>I hate him.</i>

1691
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:47,523
I'll take care of Koontz, Henry.

1692
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:58,005
Lead the way, Henry.

1693
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:01,080
Lead the way.

1694
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:22,729
All right, dog meat, I've had it.

1695
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:24,325
Your head's
gonna be bouncing off the floor--

1696
02:20:57,080 --> 02:20:59,321
No, no, no, Mike. No, no, no.

1697
02:21:00,360 --> 02:21:02,727
I will have no need of this stuff, Mike.

1698
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:06,362
Thank you very much for thinking
about me and including itjust in case.

1699
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:09,211
But none for me, thank you very much!

1700
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:11,328
- Richie, you're shouting.
- What? I know!

1701
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:14,006
Beep, beep, Richie. Beep, beep.

1702
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:17,167
Talk to us, Mike. Tell us stories.

1703
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:21,007
Tell us things so we don't have to
remember what we just saw in the library.

1704
02:21:22,840 --> 02:21:27,129
Hey, Eddie. Come on, pal.
Don't let it get you. Fight it.

1705
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:32,248
I saw myself today.
I saw myself back there.

1706
02:21:32,920 --> 02:21:36,402
I know it's just camphor water,
I know that, but I need it anwvay.

1707
02:21:36,680 --> 02:21:38,364
Take it easy, pal.

1708
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:41,689
If it works, Eddie, it's good medicine.
You've always believed in it,

1709
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:43,922
-that's all that ever mattered.
- Thanks.

1710
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:49,641
I'm sure by now you all remember
what was going on in Derry 30 years ago.

1711
02:21:50,120 --> 02:21:54,603
There was a rash of killings, maimings,
disappearances, mostly of children.

1712
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:57,570
Everybody was afraid,
but nobody did anything.

1713
02:21:58,440 --> 02:22:00,090
Until we went after lt.

1714
02:22:03,600 --> 02:22:04,840
<i>We almost killed It.</i>

1715
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:10,410
Henry Bowers confessed to everything
and the killings stopped.

1716
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:13,405
Until earlier this year,
exactly 30 years later.

1717
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,284
<i>Now, the first thing you should know is,</i>

1718
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:17,044
if you count backwards
in 30-year increments,

1719
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:21,603
every date you come to will correspond
to a huge disaster in Derry's history.

1720
02:22:21,920 --> 02:22:24,161
<i>In 1960, the big fire
at the Black Spot Club.</i>

1721
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:27,091
In 1930, the explosion
down at the old ironworks.

1722
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:30,727
In 1900, the massacre at Drake's Creek.
And on, and on.

1723
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:37,403
The biggest mystery is how 253 settlers
just disappeared without a trace.

1724
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:42,841
Thank you, Michael, for that illuminating,
if somewhat morbid, history.

1725
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,329
<i>She didn't want to know.</i>

1726
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:47,409
You knew all about this, even then.

1727
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:49,528
Miss Douglas didn't want to know.

1728
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,569
It's a disease, Bev.

1729
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:54,561
The Derry disease.
None of them wants to know.

1730
02:22:54,760 --> 02:22:58,321
-It's too horrible so they act like--
- They act like it didn't even happen.

1731
02:22:58,480 --> 02:23:01,848
I remember a man, Mr. Ross,

1732
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:07,164
he was on his front porch,
I was coming home from school.

1733
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:11,321
<i>Henry Bowers was waiting
right outside my house.</i>

1734
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:16,730
<i>I saw Mr. Ross across the street.</i>

1735
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:21,683
<i>He looked so concerned,
I thought he was going to help me,</i>

1736
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:26,241
<i>but I couldn't believe it,
he just turned around and went inside.</i>

1737
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:35,330
<i>That was when it really hit me</i>

1738
02:23:35,480 --> 02:23:38,484
there was something
terribly wrong in Derry, with Derry.

1739
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:41,328
How did you get out of that, Bev?

1740
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:46,044
Daddy came home, one of the only times
I was ever really glad to see him.

1741
02:23:48,360 --> 02:23:52,968
So, it's 30 years later and right
on schedule the killings start up again.

1742
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:54,571
Six so far, maybe more.

1743
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:57,724
<i>There have been</i> a <i>number of disappearances
with no trace of</i> a <i>body.</i>

1744
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:01,369
I wanted to be absolutely certain
before I called anyone.

1745
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,045
And I became absolutely certain

1746
02:24:03,200 --> 02:24:05,362
when I found something
at the latest crime site.

1747
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:07,962
God, that was just yesterday.

1748
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:12,880
Anwvay, this is it.

1749
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:19,886
Georgie?

1750
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:27,401
For whatever reason,

1751
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:30,251
there's something
very special about us being together.

1752
02:24:30,560 --> 02:24:33,962
We found each other that summer
and our togetherness made us strong.

1753
02:24:34,120 --> 02:24:37,363
Otherwise, lt would have picked us off,
one by one.

1754
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:38,966
Think about it.

1755
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,043
Is it an accident
that none of us have kids?

1756
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:42,440
Including Stan.

1757
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,610
Or that when we came together
as young people,

1758
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:47,489
we were all losers.

1759
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,365
<i>Now look at you.</i>

1760
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:54,851
Six of you left Derry
and became unusually successful.

1761
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,280
Big-time breadwinners.

1762
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:57,851
Leaving you here holding the bag.

1763
02:24:58,040 --> 02:25:00,042
Yeah. You kept the lighthouse
for the rest of us.

1764
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:01,964
I feel like a real jerk about that, Mike.

1765
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:03,121
Me, too.

1766
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:04,680
It's nobody's fault.

1767
02:25:04,880 --> 02:25:08,123
Our parents decided
who stayed and who went.

1768
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:11,011
When I grew up, I stayed here
because I wanted to.

1769
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:13,328
I think you stayed because you had to.

1770
02:25:14,280 --> 02:25:16,806
I don't know what's gonna happen
when the sun comes up,

1771
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,129
but I do know that I appreciate
what you've done for everyone.

1772
02:25:44,120 --> 02:25:47,329
- Good evening. You're up late.
- How much farther is Derry?

1773
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:48,801
Oh...

1774
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:53,330
I guess about maybe
500 yards to the city limits.

1775
02:25:53,640 --> 02:25:57,087
Oh, thank God.
I nearly fell asleep a while ago.

1776
02:25:57,240 --> 02:25:58,924
I feel like I've been driving forever.

1777
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:02,205
Just cross the old bridge down there
at the barrens and hang a left.

1778
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:03,567
The barrens?

1779
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,287
Yes, where
they used to play when they were kids.

1780
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:12,204
Thank you. I'll be going now.

1781
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:18,011
Don't you want your balloon first,
Mrs. Denbrough?

1782
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:20,046
Don't you want it?

1783
02:26:22,240 --> 02:26:23,287
Don't you want it?

1784
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:25,727
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

1785
02:26:26,960 --> 02:26:28,166
Don't you want it?

1786
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:29,721
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

1787
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,360
Don't you want it?

1788
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:32,921
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

1789
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:36,006
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

1790
02:26:38,240 --> 02:26:40,368
<i>They chased me up the hall,
past the lockers,</i>

1791
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:42,403
<i>they got me down
and they started slapping me.</i>

1792
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:45,604
<i>The coach found me lying there,
I was crying,</i>

1793
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:47,364
<i>and I thought he was gonna help me.</i>

1794
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:51,122
But instead, he just made fun of rne
and something inside snapped. I got mad.

1795
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:52,890
I said, "Coach, you coach track, right?"

1796
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,486
He sort of sneered at me and nodded,
and I said,

1797
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:57,728
"Well, you listen to me,
you stone-brained son of a bitch,

1798
02:26:57,880 --> 02:26:59,245
"l'm gonna go out for
the track team in March

1799
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:00,811
"and I'm gonna run down
everything you got.

1800
02:27:00,960 --> 02:27:02,166
"L'm gonna run down your best

1801
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:05,051
"and then
I want a flipping apology from you."

1802
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:06,446
All right.

1803
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:08,400
And so you did it?

1804
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:10,244
Yeah, I ran everwvhere.

1805
02:27:10,400 --> 02:27:13,768
Sometimes, my heart felt like it was
pounding so hard I was gonna pass out.

1806
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:15,763
And the first time I ran a mile,
I puked, then fainted.

1807
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:19,208
<i>Finally, I was holding up
my pants as I ran.</i>

1808
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:21,362
I mean, I ate salads
like there was no tomorrow.

1809
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:25,281
By March, I'd lost 70 pounds
and I'd grown two inches.

1810
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:27,722
Every time I ran, I felt like I could fly.

1811
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:30,486
- And you went out?
- I went out for track just like I said.

1812
02:27:30,640 --> 02:27:33,450
First day I was out there
I won the 220 and the 440.

1813
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:35,250
I just blew away the coaches. Best guys.

1814
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:37,084
After practice,
I walked right up to the coach

1815
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:40,124
and I asked for that apology.
He was so furious, he hit me.

1816
02:27:40,280 --> 02:27:42,089
- No! After all that--
- It was perfect!

1817
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:44,527
- You beat him!
- And everybody knew it.

1818
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:47,611
I graduated from El Paso High
with a letter in track.

1819
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:51,321
And the coach lost his job
over that little love tap.

1820
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:54,847
That's great, Ben.
You ought to write that one down.

1821
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,446
- Bill's our writer.
- I just write horror stories.

1822
02:27:57,600 --> 02:27:59,568
You know, we still haven't talked
about what we're going to do,

1823
02:27:59,760 --> 02:28:00,761
ifwe're gonna do anything.

1824
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:04,051
On, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey...

1825
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:06,405
Listen, kids.

1826
02:28:06,840 --> 02:28:08,808
This campfire stuff is fun, it really is,

1827
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:12,328
but it doesn't matter how painstakingly
we go over these sewer plans

1828
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:15,484
or how many damn flashlights
or helmets you got in that box.

1829
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:17,369
When the sun comes up, I'm dust,

1830
02:28:17,560 --> 02:28:20,006
and lwould suggest that
the rest of you follow me

1831
02:28:20,200 --> 02:28:22,009
and get the hell out of Dodge!

1832
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:24,482
- I cleaned it up once.
- Cleaned <i>what?</i>

1833
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,961
The blood.

1834
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:31,286
I cleaned the whole thing up
that very same night.

1835
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:05,602
<i>I decided if I was ever
going to sleep in this house again,</i>

1836
02:29:05,800 --> 02:29:07,040
<i>I'd have to know the truth.</i>

1837
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:10,361
<i>To see if anyone besides me
could see the blood.</i>

1838
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:25,890
What happened in here?
Somebody get murdered?

1839
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,890
You see it? You really see it?

1840
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:36,882
Come on, let's clean this up.

1841
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,721
<i>Until that moment,
I thought I was going crazy.</i>

1842
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:49,407
<i>It was so strange to be happy
about something so grim.</i>

1843
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:52,925
I fell in love with all of you guys
that day.

1844
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:56,571
And after we cleaned it up,
the blood never came back.

1845
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:06,204
It will be morning soon.

1846
02:30:08,400 --> 02:30:10,562
-L'm cold.
- Me, too.

1847
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:13,925
- L'll get you something.
- There's a shawl in my room.

1848
02:30:14,080 --> 02:30:16,924
Give me your room key and I'll get it.

1849
02:30:17,640 --> 02:30:19,369
Richie, you have a key?

1850
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:21,086
<i>YOUNG</i> BILL; <i>All right. NOW, listen up.</i>

1851
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:23,282
Stay together, guys. No stragglers.

1852
02:30:25,240 --> 02:30:28,289
Just get the first thing you find.
I need to stretch my legs anwvay.

1853
02:30:28,480 --> 02:30:29,527
Ben.

1854
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:32,564
- Don't go alone.
- Uh, I need a refill anwvay.

1855
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:34,766
I'll join you.

1856
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:48,321
I'll take care of Richie.

1857
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:51,723
Okay. We meet back here in three minutes,
no more. Keep your doors open.

1858
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:45,122
Hello, nigger. I'll pay you back.

1859
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,051
I'm gonna pay you all back.

1860
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:03,570
Oh, good. You found lt.

1861
02:32:06,880 --> 02:32:10,680
I'm glad we're alone for a minute.
I've been wanting to say something to you.

1862
02:32:13,360 --> 02:32:16,887
"Your hair is winter fire. January embers.

1863
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:21,724
-"My heart burns there, too."
-lt was you.

1864
02:32:22,880 --> 02:32:25,565
I've been waiting a long time
to thank the poet.

1865
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:32,847
- Did you ask Bill first?
- No.

1866
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:36,404
I knew it was you.
I've always known it was you.

1867
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:41,044
I think I must have been waiting, Ben,
waiting until we were both ready.

1868
02:32:42,840 --> 02:32:44,365
I'm ready now. Are you?

1869
02:32:56,240 --> 02:32:58,527
Oh, oh, Beverly.

1870
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:17,205
Kiss me, fat boy!

1871
02:33:55,160 --> 02:33:56,400
Belch...

1872
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:06,162
Mike! Mike!

1873
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:07,966
Mike!

1874
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:12,969
You all right?
lgot it.

1875
02:34:16,480 --> 02:34:18,164
- Get him in there.
- Give me a hand.

1876
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:20,324
Watch it! Okay, easy.

1877
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:25,370
-ln the car.
- Hurry up!

1878
02:34:26,160 --> 02:34:27,764
- Go!Go!Go!
- No, Mike!

1879
02:35:04,040 --> 02:35:06,566
<i>If Mike dies,
there will be five of us left.</i>

1880
02:35:08,120 --> 02:35:10,566
Who comes next? Which one of us?

1881
02:35:12,840 --> 02:35:14,524
Why is lt doing this?

1882
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:16,731
Why does It hate?

1883
02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:19,562
Why is It so mean?

1884
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:30,245
Oh, Ben.

1885
02:35:32,920 --> 02:35:34,524
I want to tell you something.

1886
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:37,169
You remember what my father was like?

1887
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,606
I fell in love with a man

1888
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:45,890
who turned out to be everything
I always hated in my father.

1889
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,966
Why would I do that?
How could I be so blind?

1890
02:35:54,440 --> 02:35:58,729
If you see it now,
you're not blind anymore, Bev.

1891
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:01,929
Congratulations. That's a miracle.

1892
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:05,846
Besides, at least you fell in love
with somebody.

1893
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:10,131
At least you felt something.

1894
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:12,930
That's a miracle, too.

1895
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,248
You have the heart of a poet, Ben.

1896
02:36:20,440 --> 02:36:22,442
"Your hair is winter fire."

1897
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:27,726
- Why did you say that?
- You wrote it, didn't you?

1898
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:30,885
"Your hair is winter fire.
January embers." Something.

1899
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:33,967
When lwas young, I thought it was Bill,
but it was you, wasn't it?

1900
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:36,327
Damn it, Bev, is that you in there
or is that the clown?

1901
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:38,767
I don't know what the hell is going on!
How am I supposed to know?

1902
02:36:38,960 --> 02:36:39,961
It's me.

1903
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:42,731
It's me.

1904
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,002
"My heart burns there, too."

1905
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:34,642
- Mike's gonna be okay.
- Can we see him?

1906
02:37:34,920 --> 02:37:36,046
He's not out of the woods yet.

1907
02:37:36,200 --> 02:37:38,521
I guess one of you could go in
forjust a minute.

1908
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:49,841
Mike?

1909
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:53,443
Everyone else is right outside.

1910
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:56,842
- Henry?
- He's dead.

1911
02:37:58,520 --> 02:37:59,885
- Police?
- Not yet.

1912
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:04,042
Be careful. We can't trust anyone.

1913
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:07,006
If anybody asks, a party got out of hand.

1914
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:09,248
You were dancing on the table,
you took a fall.

1915
02:38:10,720 --> 02:38:13,041
Anyone who's seen me dance will buy that.

1916
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:17,730
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know, man.

1917
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:19,764
I honestly do not know.

1918
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:22,882
Myjacket. Outside pocket.

1919
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:36,402
<i><i>It's silver. ll' can kill ll'.</i>

1920
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:40,082
But we left these down in the...

1921
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:45,091
You went back?

1922
02:38:46,800 --> 02:38:48,768
I was pretty sure lt was asleep.

1923
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:51,085
"Pretty sure"?

1924
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:53,360
You went alone?

1925
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:58,047
Ten years ago my life was going downhill.
I was close to suicide.

1926
02:38:58,840 --> 02:39:01,161
I think I really wanted It
to wake up and kill me.

1927
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:03,841
<i>Took me all day
stumbling around in the dark.</i>

1928
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,081
<i>I found one right away.</i>

1929
02:39:05,680 --> 02:39:07,011
In the drain trap.

1930
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:10,682
The other one, the one that hit Pennwvise,
was lodged in a crack in the wall.

1931
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:15,965
I figured we might need that kind of help
again one day.

1932
02:39:17,360 --> 02:39:19,886
When I came out,
I kind of I got my life together.

1933
02:39:21,560 --> 02:39:23,085
The only change was this.

1934
02:39:23,800 --> 02:39:25,040
Almost overnight.

1935
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:29,321
Fean

1936
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:32,647
Bill.

1937
02:39:33,320 --> 02:39:35,163
If you decide not use those,

1938
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:38,724
if you leave, I'll understand.

1939
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:47,284
People, that is a dead body.

1940
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:50,603
You're not seriously suggesting we walk
out of here and leave it lying there?

1941
02:39:50,760 --> 02:39:51,886
Yeah. That's what I'm suggesting.

1942
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:54,566
- I think we ought to call the police.
- I think Eddie's right.

1943
02:39:54,720 --> 02:39:58,406
You don't understand. This whole town
is It in some way. All of them.

1944
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:10,486
Bill's right.

1945
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:12,962
Ifwe call the police,
get the town involved,

1946
02:40:13,160 --> 02:40:14,889
something bad's going to
happen to one of us.

1947
02:40:15,080 --> 02:40:16,366
Maybe all of us.

1948
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:21,528
All right. Have it your way. Stan is dead.
Mike came close. I've seen enough.

1949
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:22,681
I'm with you, boy.

1950
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:24,769
You can put this behind you
just like that?

1951
02:40:24,920 --> 02:40:27,366
I'm a little old
for monster hunting, Bill.

1952
02:40:27,520 --> 02:40:28,521
So was Mike.

1953
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:30,251
So was Stan.

1954
02:40:31,040 --> 02:40:33,088
- Is that how you feel, Ben?
- I don't know how I feel.

1955
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:35,208
All I know is, I can't stay
in this room much longer.

1956
02:40:35,360 --> 02:40:39,524
So I suggest we just turn on the TV,
hang a "Do not disturb" sign on the door,

1957
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:42,007
go outside, then figure out what to do.

1958
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:43,731
I second that.

1959
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,730
<i>Police Chief Andrew Rademacher
of the downtown branch said the victim,</i>

1960
02:40:58,880 --> 02:41:00,086
<i>5-year-old Danielle Huxton,</i>

1961
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:02,242
<i>had been playing
at the creek near her home.</i>

1962
02:41:02,560 --> 02:41:05,450
<i>Local authorities have not yet said
whether there might be a connection</i>

1963
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:08,968
<i>between this and</i> a <i>recent rash of
disappearances involving young children.</i>

1964
02:41:09,440 --> 02:41:12,444
<i>They did reveal, however,
that the body was severely mutilated.</i>

1965
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:15,771
<i>In other news tonight,</i>
a <i>series of robberies in the east end</i>

1966
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:17,081
<i>has local officials baffled...</i>

1967
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:22,684
Appreciate it if you just
put that on my card, send me a receipt.

1968
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:24,490
- Oh, certainly, Mr. Hanscom.
- Me, too, thank you.

1969
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:26,569
- Ditto, thanks.
- Nice time, loads of fun. Got to go, bye.

1970
02:42:13,560 --> 02:42:14,721
Need a ride, Bill?

1971
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,082
- Where are you going, Richie?
- Airport.

1972
02:42:17,640 --> 02:42:20,041
- I guess we are, too, Bill.
- Come with us.

1973
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:24,641
Ijust saw something
and I have no idea if it was real.

1974
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:28,481
<i>If any of you would have seen it or not.</i>

1975
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,081
I can't go.

1976
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:35,443
Because if I do, I'm gonna
live with this until I go insane.

1977
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:40,206
Until I can't tell the difference
between my life and my bad dreams.

1978
02:42:41,520 --> 02:42:43,761
For years I've been getting paid
to scare people.

1979
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:47,843
But I'm the one who's been scared.

1980
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:50,891
All my life.

1981
02:42:52,480 --> 02:42:54,448
I don't want to be scared anymore.

1982
02:42:57,120 --> 02:42:58,451
I'm going back in.

1983
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:03,650
This time I'm gonna kill It.

1984
02:43:04,280 --> 02:43:05,327
<i><i>Help me!</i>

1985
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:07,481
<i>Help me!</i>

1986
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:12,964
Please, help me.

1987
02:44:17,960 --> 02:44:20,406
I don't suppose anybody thought
to bring anything really useful,

1988
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:21,800
like a machine gun?

1989
02:44:21,960 --> 02:44:24,440
I brought this. It's the only thing
I saved from those days.

1990
02:44:24,840 --> 02:44:27,320
- I remember you were a dead shot, Bev.
- You couldn't miss.

1991
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:29,767
It was like it was supposed
to be Bev, remember?

1992
02:44:29,960 --> 02:44:32,122
You hit the clown, Pennwvise,
in the head, it broke open.

1993
02:44:32,280 --> 02:44:34,442
- And underneath it was a light.
- Bright lights.

1994
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:36,523
Deadlights. We saw them, too,
for a second.

1995
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:37,801
Bev?

1996
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:40,964
- Bill, how on earth...
- Mike went back down and got them.

1997
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:44,645
These are for him and for Stan.

1998
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,802
- Lucky seven.
- We're all here now.

1999
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:54,370
Oh, come on, guys. What the hell are you
going to do now? Sing Kumbaya?

2000
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:58,646
Wake up. Take a breath. Do you smell that?

2001
02:44:58,920 --> 02:44:59,967
That's death.

2002
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:02,891
It's not for Mike, it's not for Stan,
it's not for Henry Bowers.

2003
02:45:03,080 --> 02:45:04,809
It's for us. It's in the air.

2004
02:45:04,960 --> 02:45:08,760
Losers fight It, losers die.
And you know that, don't you, Captain?

2005
02:45:09,400 --> 02:45:12,244
- You don't have to go down there, Richie.
- Right.

2006
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:13,765
I didn't have to get on a plane in LA,

2007
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:16,531
I didn't have to go to the dinner,
I sure as hell didn't have to come here.

2008
02:45:16,680 --> 02:45:18,364
And now I don't have to go in.

2009
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:27,361
I still say we should have brought
a machine gun.

2010
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:39,444
I remember the first thing I saw down here
was one of those damn pom-poms.

2011
02:46:45,480 --> 02:46:49,769
- This purse looks new.
- Oh, dear God. It's not possible.

2012
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:51,924
- Audra.
- What?

2013
02:46:52,120 --> 02:46:54,930
How in God's name--
She's down here.

2014
02:46:55,240 --> 02:46:56,287
- His wife?
-lt's got her.

2015
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:58,324
- How could she...
-lt could be a trick or something.

2016
02:46:58,920 --> 02:47:00,285
Bill, wait, damn it!

2017
02:47:00,440 --> 02:47:01,646
Audra!

2018
02:47:16,200 --> 02:47:18,168
Audra. Audra.

2019
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:20,203
<i>- Bill.
- Come back, Bill!</i>

2020
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:24,281
- Do you want to get yourself killed?
- Oh, God, Bill!

2021
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:26,209
BENZ God, Bill, you all right?

2022
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:30,562
It's my fault. She followed me.

2023
02:47:32,520 --> 02:47:33,965
- I told her--
- Bill, that's enough!

2024
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:36,686
If she is down here,
there's only one way you can help her.

2025
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:40,443
Now you know what we came down here for
and we're going to do it.

2026
02:47:40,600 --> 02:47:44,321
Now, we need you. We need you
to stand up for us like before,

2027
02:47:44,480 --> 02:47:46,050
or none of us is going to get out of here.

2028
02:47:57,800 --> 02:47:59,040
Come on.

2029
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:06,411
Stay close together.

2030
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:27,570
- Looks like we're off the map.
- I think...

2031
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:30,646
That way.

2032
02:49:07,160 --> 02:49:08,525
We're here.

2033
02:49:10,480 --> 02:49:12,960
- The roots all grow down.
- Yeah.

2034
02:49:13,160 --> 02:49:15,891
- Yeah, the walls cracked, remember?
- When It came.

2035
02:49:16,080 --> 02:49:18,731
Dear God, please don't let these things
come to life.

2036
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:20,803
Don't you even think that, spaghetti man.

2037
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,968
I told you not to call me "spaghetti man."

2038
02:49:23,120 --> 02:49:25,646
I think something is coming.

2039
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:04,849
- My boat.
- Georgie.

2040
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:07,285
It's all your fault.

2041
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,569
Oh... Georgie.

2042
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:13,481
All yourfault, Bill.
You sent me out and lt killed me.

2043
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:18,040
N0. N0, Georgie. I didn't know.

2044
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:21,647
Bill, remember, that's not Georgie.
Remember. Fight it!

2045
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:23,964
It was in the drain, Bill.

2046
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:26,851
It was in the drain.
And you let It kill me.

2047
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:30,126
No. <i>l</i> loved you.

2048
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:31,810
Damn it, Bill,
that thing's not your brother.

2049
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:33,803
- Come on, man.
- Fight it.

2050
02:50:36,240 --> 02:50:39,050
You are not George.

2051
02:50:41,480 --> 02:50:43,244
George is dead,

2052
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:45,604
and it's not my fault.

2053
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:56,731
You killed my brother, George,
you bastard.

2054
02:50:57,160 --> 02:50:58,685
Let's see you now.

2055
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:01,366
<i>Let's</i> see you now.

2056
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:04,330
Show yourself.

2057
02:51:09,360 --> 02:51:11,362
You killed my little brother

2058
02:51:12,520 --> 02:51:14,568
and now you're going to pay.

2059
02:51:20,480 --> 02:51:23,404
<i>Go while you still can.</i>

2060
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:28,522
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

2061
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:30,531
Show yourself.

2062
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:35,010
<i>Silly boy.</i>

2063
02:51:35,320 --> 02:51:39,041
You still think you can see me.

2064
02:51:41,640 --> 02:51:43,085
You'll never see me.

2065
02:51:43,240 --> 02:51:46,926
<i>You'll see only
what your little mind can allow.</i>

2066
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:49,602
Go! Now.

2067
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:51,763
For if you stay,

2068
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:54,721
you'll lose your little mind

2069
02:51:55,120 --> 02:51:58,044
in my deadlights.

2070
02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:00,291
<i>Like all the others.</i>

2071
02:52:01,240 --> 02:52:03,402
Like all the others.

2072
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:27,881
Bill. We can't fight that thing.
That's like trying to fight smoke.

2073
02:52:28,120 --> 02:52:30,771
Don't you understand
what Mike was trying to tell us?

2074
02:52:31,240 --> 02:52:33,083
It feeds, Richie.

2075
02:52:33,560 --> 02:52:36,609
It wakes up every 30 years and it feeds.

2076
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:41,164
And in order to feed, it has
to take on some kind of physical form.

2077
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:44,451
It's here.

2078
02:52:45,800 --> 02:52:47,882
Down here. Somewhere.

2079
02:53:57,160 --> 02:53:58,685
Fee, fi, f0, fum.

2080
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:01,729
- You think we're strong enough?
- We have to be.

2081
02:54:01,880 --> 02:54:04,247
I have to tell you guys something
before we go in there.

2082
02:54:04,440 --> 02:54:06,090
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

2083
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:09,689
-l've been lying.
- About what?

2084
02:54:10,360 --> 02:54:12,362
When I said that I was seeing someone.

2085
02:54:13,280 --> 02:54:16,568
Well, I'm not. In fact, I haven't ever...

2086
02:54:17,880 --> 02:54:20,531
I mean, I've never even been with any...

2087
02:54:20,840 --> 02:54:22,968
Eddie, what are you saying?
You're a virgin?

2088
02:54:23,320 --> 02:54:24,367
Yeah.

2089
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:27,680
Well, I can't help you with that, pal.
But thanks for sharing.

2090
02:54:27,840 --> 02:54:29,285
Richie, let him talk.

2091
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:33,051
You see...

2092
02:54:33,560 --> 02:54:36,882
I could never sleep
with somebody that I didn't love.

2093
02:54:37,480 --> 02:54:39,960
And I've never really loved anyone.

2094
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:43,844
Except you 9W5-

2095
02:54:45,560 --> 02:54:46,561
H9)'-

2096
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:46,165
Oh, <i>my</i> God.

2097
02:55:58,480 --> 02:56:00,323
A body.

2098
02:56:05,320 --> 02:56:06,481
Audra.

2099
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:09,162
- Bill, for God's sake!
- Wait for us, buddy.

2100
02:56:09,400 --> 02:56:11,164
It's Audra. I'm going to get her.

2101
02:56:40,600 --> 02:56:41,886
Bill...

2102
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:49,171
I damn you to hell.

2103
02:56:58,960 --> 02:57:00,200
Please, dear God!

2104
02:57:02,120 --> 02:57:07,286
"He thrusts his fists against the posts,

2105
02:57:07,440 --> 02:57:11,889
"and still insists he sees the ghosts."

2106
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:32,962
It's taking him. Bill!

2107
02:57:38,640 --> 02:57:40,768
Come on, guys! We got to--

2108
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:47,805
Bev! Bev, where are you going? Bev...

2109
02:57:51,320 --> 02:57:52,731
Bev...

2110
02:57:52,880 --> 02:57:54,769
What am I going to do?

2111
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:58,401
This is battery acid, you slime!

2112
02:58:10,920 --> 02:58:15,005
I believe in Santa Claus.
I believe in the Easter Bunny.

2113
02:58:16,640 --> 02:58:18,483
I believe in the Tooth Fairy.

2114
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:20,605
But I don't believe in you.

2115
02:58:22,160 --> 02:58:25,767
This is battery acid. Now you disappear.

2116
02:58:44,440 --> 02:58:46,568
Please, God, don't let me miss again.

2117
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:17,490
BENZ Eddie? Eddie.

2118
02:59:20,520 --> 02:59:22,010
Hey...

2119
02:59:22,160 --> 02:59:23,525
Nice shot, Bev.

2120
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:26,844
Don't you talk. Don't talk.
You're gonna be fine, spaghetti man.

2121
02:59:28,360 --> 02:59:30,010
Richie, please...

2122
02:59:30,160 --> 02:59:33,164
For the last time, don't call me that.

2123
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:37,409
You know how I...

2124
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:43,046
Eddie.

2125
02:59:46,760 --> 02:59:48,046
Eddie.

2126
03:00:03,640 --> 03:00:05,210
This isn't over.

2127
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:08,041
If that thing comes back when I'm 70...

2128
03:00:08,200 --> 03:00:10,407
Let's finish lt. Once and for all.

2129
03:01:19,960 --> 03:01:20,961
Audra.

2130
03:01:34,320 --> 03:01:35,810
It's all coming down.

2131
03:02:20,720 --> 03:02:22,529
<i>I guess that's how
I'd like to remember us,</i>

2132
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:24,011
<i>if I could remember us.</i>

2133
03:02:24,200 --> 03:02:27,921
<i>Standing there by the lake
with the sun going down on our childhood.</i>

2134
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:31,363
<i>This will be my last entry.
I got it in just in time.</i>

2135
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:35,047
<i>Just before the fog in my brain
swept all of my memories away entirely.</i>

2136
03:02:38,360 --> 03:02:40,488
<i>Now, just weeks later,
I look back on that time</i>

2137
03:02:40,640 --> 03:02:43,325
<i>not from memory,
but from the pages of this book.</i>

2138
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:44,720
<i>The nightmare is over.</i>

2139
03:02:44,880 --> 03:02:47,850
<i>What little police involvement there was
was brief and cursory.</i>

2140
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,048
<i>As is always the case here in Derry.</i>

2141
03:02:51,120 --> 03:02:53,600
<i>Now that there's no further need
for</i> a <i>lighthouse keeper...</i>

2142
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:57,446
<i>Well, I feel I may move on,
see whatever's down the road apiece.</i>

2143
03:02:58,400 --> 03:03:01,165
<i>As of this writing,
Richie's still knocking them dead.</i>

2144
03:03:01,360 --> 03:03:02,407
<i>He's got</i> a <i>pan' in</i> a <i>movie.</i>

2145
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:05,448
574. Take 18, mark.

2146
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:07,011
<i>He costars with another comic,</i>

2147
03:03:07,200 --> 03:03:09,248
a <i>guy any of the lucky seven
could have told you</i>

2148
03:03:09,400 --> 03:03:11,402
<i>looks and acts</i> a <i>lot like Eddie Kaspbrak.</i>

2149
03:03:14,800 --> 03:03:15,881
<i>And</i> cut.

2150
03:03:17,200 --> 03:03:19,885
<i>Ben and Bev left Derry together,
headed west.</i>

2151
03:03:20,040 --> 03:03:23,328
<i>After</i> a <i>week, they were married.
A few weeks later, they were pregnant.</i>

2152
03:03:23,480 --> 03:03:25,084
<i>Another curse broken.</i>

2153
03:03:31,680 --> 03:03:34,763
<i>Bill and Audra are still here.
I wish the news were better.</i>

2154
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:38,561
<i>But Audra 's condition is unchanged.
They're leaving today.</i>

2155
03:03:40,640 --> 03:03:42,927
Okay, Audra. It's time to go.

2156
03:03:43,080 --> 03:03:45,082
<i>Bill thought the time here,
the time away from his work,</i>

2157
03:03:45,280 --> 03:03:46,486
<i>might somehow help.</i>

2158
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:50,646
<i>But I guess Audra 's gone for good.
One of It's many casualties.</i>

2159
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:54,567
<i>Locked in that haunted place
where she saw Its deadlights.</i>

2160
03:03:54,720 --> 03:03:58,611
<i>Bill has been good to visit every day.</i>
We <i>laugh about our failing memories.</i>

2161
03:03:59,080 --> 03:04:01,048
<i>We sometimes have to ask
each other's names now.</i>

2162
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:05,561
<i>His sadness is profound.
I wish there was something I could do.</i>

2163
03:04:05,760 --> 03:04:07,524
<i>Something I could have done.</i>

2164
03:04:15,680 --> 03:04:18,604
<i><i>Hi yo, Silver. Away!</i>

2165
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:20,681
Wait.

2166
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:28,809
Audra, this bike saved
little Stan's life once. Mine, too.

2167
03:04:29,160 --> 03:04:31,481
We were going so fast,
I think we beat the devil.

2168
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:34,846
I don't know if I can go that fast again.

2169
03:04:35,280 --> 03:04:36,486
Hold on.

2170
03:04:50,840 --> 03:04:51,841
Beat it.

2171
03:04:52,200 --> 03:04:54,407
Beat it. Beat it. Beat it, Audra.

2172
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:57,126
Beat it. Beat it.

2173
03:05:05,640 --> 03:05:07,369
Come on. Come on.

2174
03:05:21,520 --> 03:05:22,726
- Bill?
- Yes.

2175
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:25,048
- Bill, where are we? What are we doing?
- Yes, it's okay.

2176
03:05:25,200 --> 03:05:26,406
It's okay. Hang on.

2177
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:28,050
Just hang on, babe, it's okay.
