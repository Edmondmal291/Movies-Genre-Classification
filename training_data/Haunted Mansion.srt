1
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:55,000
<i>Welcome, Foolish Mortals,</i>

2
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,500
<i>to New Orleans.</i>

3
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,208
<i>A most paranormal place.</i>

4
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:04,834
<i>Where somber funerals end in celebration.</i>

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
<i>Where death is not an ending,</i>

6
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,458
<i>but a new beginning.</i>

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,667
<i>And even grief can be a doorway to joy,</i>

8
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:20,834
<i>if one is willing to walk through it.</i>

9
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,375
It's 11:58! Let's get ready.

10
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,834
- Wow.
- Excuse me, bartender.

11
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,041
Uh, sorry, sorry. Excuse me, bartender.

12
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:43,583
Can I get a drink? Oh, okay.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Here.

14
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,625
You can have mine.

15
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,500
Then you won't have any.

16
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,208
That's fine, I'm not drinking much.

17
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:54,875
Maybe we could share it.

18
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,208
Yeah.

19
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,417
Are you here with somebody?

20
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,583
Yes.

21
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,875
I am here with my co-workers

22
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,458
who are right behind me,
I'm sure, being very awkward.

23
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,083
What is it that you do?

24
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,208
Um, I'm an astrophysicist.

25
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,667
That's like, um,

26
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:13,542
a rocket scientist.

27
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:15,458
Oh. Um, more "optics."

28
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:16,622
- Optics.
- I create lenses.

29
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,500
For instance, I'm currently working
on a formula to map dark matter

30
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,583
by combining instructions
we already have in place

31
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,351
with what we're learning
from quantum mechanics,

32
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,518
and it's really quite complicated, but...

33
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,083
Yeah, sounds like
you're trying to see the unseen.

34
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,291
That's exactly what I'm doing.

35
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,959
But you said it in a much better way.

36
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:33,750
Okay, I kind of, um...

37
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,458
I kind of do the same thing.

38
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:37,000
I give ghost tours.

39
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,834
Oh. So, you don't do
the same thing at all.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,291
Not at all,
but it's kinda like it.

41
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,709
I, um... I help people see things
they can't always see.

42
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,500
Like ghosts flying through the air.

43
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:49,643
- Apparitions...
- Ten!

44
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,851
- Spirits flying through walls...
- Nine! Eight!

45
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,995
- And possessing people.
- You're making fun of me...

46
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,166
Seven!

47
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,500
- But come on one of my tours.
- Six! Five!

48
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,625
- Yeah.
- Four!

49
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,709
Yes.

50
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:02,959
Three! Two! One!

51
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,333
Happy New Year!

52
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:09,417
I'm Ben.

53
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,959
Alyssa.

54
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,375
<i>Ben?</i>

55
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,333
<i>Ben!</i>

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,583
- Ben?
- Huh?

57
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,917
Listen, I hate to pile on top
of what I assume is a bad day,

58
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,500
but, uh, this thing isn't working.

59
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,542
What makes you think I'm having a bad day?

60
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,309
Why am I assuming
that you're having a bad day?

61
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,166
'Cause you smell like yesterday.

62
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:41,667
Here.

63
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,959
How many are out there?

64
00:03:45,542 --> 00:03:47,250
- Seven.
- Okay, seven.

65
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,083
Why are you still leading her tour?

66
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,650
Look, I can sneak you out the back.

67
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,542
Oh, no, they'll follow me.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,333
They always do.

69
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,083
Yeah.

70
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,917
Oh!

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,166
Are you Ben, our tour guide?

72
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,291
- Yes, I am.
- I'm from Syracuse.

73
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,855
Great, we're gonna read some names.
That's what we're gonna do.

74
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,208
And I wanna hear H-E-R-E, the word "here,"

75
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,171
and that's the only word
I need to hear, got it?

76
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,667
Um, so it looks like
we have a "John Peluso"?

77
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,750
Present.

78
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,417
Been an accountant for almost 50 years.

79
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,667
Oh, I don't care.

80
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:18,917
It looks like we also have a Carol.

81
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:20,250
Here!

82
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,083
I'm a Carol. Are you a Carol?

83
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,750
Yeah, I mean, like, that's so funny!

84
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,166
Carol's a very common name.

85
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,184
Isn't this building
supposed to be haunted?

86
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,917
This is an historical walking tour.
Hey, hey, hey.

87
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,267
I will show you things,
and I will talk about them.

88
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,333
No ghost stories.

89
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:49,917
So, uh,

90
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:53,792
well, I hear that this cathedral here,
that has ghosts.

91
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,333
No such thing as ghosts.

92
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,750
Oh, I believe in ghosts.

93
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,250
My aunt Barbara, she was an avid birder

94
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,875
and she adored hummingbirds.

95
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,542
Day of her funeral, what do we see?

96
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:05,709
A hummingbird!

97
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,375
Okay, Carols,

98
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,625
let me impart a little bit of truth
on to you.

99
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:14,000
I've been in every "haunted house"

100
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,917
in the most haunted city in the world.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,125
I've even been in that building.
Seventy-two hours.

102
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:19,829
You wanna know what I found?

103
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,417
Nothing. Not a thing.

104
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,667
Ghosts don't exist. Life is dirt.
We're all dirt!

105
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,458
Sorry...

106
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,166
Uh, I'm sorry.

107
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:37,417
All right, come on.

108
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,458
Welcome home.

109
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,166
{\an8}Hey.

110
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:01,583
{\an8}It's the movers.

111
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,291
{\an8}Yeah, we're here. How close are you?

112
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:07,208
{\an8}How are you four hours behind?
We left at the same time.

113
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,625
{\an8}Yeah. No, I understand a lunch break,

114
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:14,073
{\an8}but this sounds a little bit more
like dinner and a movie.

115
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,667
{\an8}We'll see you when we see you.

116
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,125
{\an8}Ugh, these movers.

117
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,041
{\an8}Travis?

118
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,166
{\an8}Oh, I'm over here, Mom.

119
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,667
{\an8}Uh, just checking out the house.

120
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,393
{\an8}It's time. It's time.

121
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,417
{\an8}Someone's here.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,180
{\an8}Places everyone. Places.

123
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,333
He can see us.

124
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:09,208
This place is going to be great
when we fix it up.

125
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,250
{\an8}Oh!

126
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,125
{\an8}Wow.

127
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,667
{\an8}You wanna pick out your room?

128
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,917
{\an8}It's probably upstairs.

129
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,083
{\an8}-Love it?
- No.

130
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,125
Not today.

131
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,500
Welcome home!

132
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,834
No, no, no!

133
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,434
Pumpkin. What's wrong?

134
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,542
This place is haunted!

135
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:57,834
All right, now, hang on.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,375
Now, I know this place isn't as

137
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,583
warm as I had hoped.

138
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,250
But, you know, I think we get
some daylight in here,

139
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,973
it's gonna feel better.

140
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,834
Hey, I'm gonna light a vanilla candle
and it's gonna be a game changer.

141
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,792
Will it though?

142
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:16,041
Sweetie, I need you
to give this place a chance.

143
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,709
This is our home now.

144
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,500
Nah. We're out.

145
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
No, no.

146
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,475
Come on, get in the car. Get in the car.

147
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,250
Seat belts. Safety first.

148
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,533
- Why won't it...
- Slow, slow,

149
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,726
- you got this, you got this.
- Okay.

150
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,750
- Mommy's got you.
- Okay.

151
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:44,542
Don't you worry about it, I love antiques,
but not that much!

152
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,959
You'll be back.

153
00:10:57,041 --> 00:11:00,750
You'll be back.

154
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,750
Okay, okay. I got it, Alyssa.

155
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,375
Excuse me, hey,
do you know the guy who lives here?

156
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:28,500
Oh, yeah.
But he's not very friendly.

157
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,250
Whoa...

158
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,125
Ow!

159
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,375
Hello?

160
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,309
So, this is how a genius lives.

161
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,393
- What are you doing?
- Whoa, whoa!

162
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,059
Take it easy, take it easy,
I'm not a thief!

163
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,709
Look. No, the treasures I seek
are in heaven.

164
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:49,375
What kind of psychopath just
enters someone's house, huh?

165
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry, I know opportunity
usually knocks,

166
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,625
but sometimes it just can't wait.

167
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:55,375
- Like right now.
- What? What?

168
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,542
Why are you...

169
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,625
Why do you have a cat?

170
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,333
- This isn't yours?
- No.

171
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,291
Oh, I thought it was yours.
He was beggin' to get in.

172
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:05,875
Onwards, my furry friend. Onwards.

173
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:07,959
I guess the little guy just could feel

174
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,375
all the positive energy
flowin' out of this...

175
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,375
charming apartment.

176
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,417
Should we crack a window?

177
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,834
I'm Father Kent, by the way.

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,625
Hi, Kent.

179
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,417
- You mind if I take a seat?
- Uh, absolutely, I mind.

180
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,625
Okay, okay, okay.

181
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:27,000
Listen, one question and then I leave.

182
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,917
You wanna be a hero?

183
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,250
Pass.

184
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,000
- You ready to have your mind blown?
- Goodbye.

185
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,125
Two words.

186
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:38,000
Spectral Photography.

187
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:39,834
Yeah.

188
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:41,291
That catch your attention?

189
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,417
Because it sure caught mine.

190
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:47,709
I mean, did you really create
a camera strong enough

191
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,125
to capture something
called the "ghost particle"?

192
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,291
No, I never called it that.
That was the press.

193
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,458
Anyway, I was professionally ridiculed.

194
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,083
Hey, Dr. Frankenstein.

195
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:01,417
There's a man of science,
and they came at him with pitchforks.

196
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
And why?

197
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,041
For trying to create something.

198
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,875
He created a monster, all right?

199
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,519
- That, if I'm not mistaken...
- Well...

200
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,250
killed a few people, I think, right?

201
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,417
Hey, one man's monster
is another man's great Halloween costume.

202
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,208
Oh. Wow, mind blown.

203
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,959
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, hear me out.

204
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,208
I got a call from a really sweet woman.

205
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,166
She has a lovely little kid,

206
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,792
and they think their house is haunted.

207
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,208
She wanted me to perform an exorcism,

208
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:26,792
but what I think we need is

209
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,250
a paranormal expert.

210
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:31,000
- I'm a tour guide.
- You're Ben Matthias.

211
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,417
You worked at the Space Center,
building telescopes.

212
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Before that,

213
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,583
you were an astrophysicist at CERN.

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Now, you're giving walking tours?

215
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,166
That's like having Michael Jordan
play baseball.

216
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,583
Let's put you in the game
where you belong.

217
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,083
Playing the right position.

218
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,208
That woman is probably out of her wits.

219
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,458
There's no such thing as ghosts.

220
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:51,782
Then what's the harm in just...

221
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:53,458
You drive an hour north,

222
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,792
you snap a few pics with the ghost camera,

223
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,500
and you put their mind at ease.

224
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,792
I am not driving an hour anywhere to...

225
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:00,875
She'll pay.

226
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,333
$2,000.

227
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,709
What's the address?

228
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,375
Mm. Money talks.

229
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,250
Hey, it talks to me, too. But, shh!

230
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,613
Don't say anything.

231
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,000
The big man upstairs is always watching,

232
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:15,083
and he keeps me on a really
short leash.

233
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,125
- Yeah, not short enough.
- Hey, listen.

234
00:14:17,208 --> 00:14:19,000
My job is having faith,

235
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,792
and I got faith in you.

236
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,792
<i>You know how you and I
are so different,</i>

237
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,625
<i>but when we come together
it's really good?</i>

238
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,166
<i>Agreed.</i>

239
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,041
Well, this is like a bridge
from what you do to what I do.

240
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,291
Right? So, look, I got this.

241
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,542
What are you do...

242
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,208
It's a lens.

243
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:05,709
Oh...

244
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,000
- It's a lens!
- Careful.

245
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,750
A quantum lens

246
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:12,458
which, if everything works
how it's supposed to,

247
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:14,834
it'll change our lives.

248
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,875
All right, let's see this here.

249
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,333
What?

250
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,917
Of course, dead battery.

251
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,792
Oh.

252
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:11,083
- Ben?
- Gabbie?

253
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,101
- You made it!
- Nice to meet you.

254
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,165
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry I'm late.

255
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,333
Um, some fog had come up near the house
and it was weird, but...

256
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,834
- Yeah, about that...
- It's fine.

257
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,792
Wait!

258
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,500
I should warn you
before you step inside the house.

259
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:28,000
This is bad, this is bad.

260
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,417
As much as I need you...

261
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:31,792
you can leave.

262
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,226
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yeah, you should leave.

263
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,393
- If you wanna leave, you can leave.
- It's fine, Gabbie.

264
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,777
I'm not afraid of a couple ghosts.

265
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:38,583
You say that now.

266
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,417
But really,

267
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,542
this could change
the course of your entire life.

268
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,000
- Oh.
- Once you come inside,

269
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,083
like, that's it.

270
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:47,583
There is no... no going back.

271
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,875
I guess it's just a risk
I'm willing to take.

272
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,834
Now, about the money, uh, you...

273
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,875
Perfect.

274
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,000
All right.

275
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,917
- Damn!
- Yes.

276
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,166
You did not have to give me
this much money.

277
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,893
I mean, I don't even know
if I can take this.

278
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:02,083
No, take it, I insist.

279
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,375
Okay, I'm taking it.

280
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:06,333
So, why don't you tell me
some more about this house, huh?

281
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,500
Uh, it's probably best I show you.

282
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,125
- Yeah, yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah.

283
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,333
Okay.

284
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:18,750
Who are they?

285
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,709
Unclear. I've asked around.

286
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:25,500
There are a lot of colorful theories
about this place.

287
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,583
I, uh...

288
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:29,125
Okay, well, that's my son.

289
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:32,959
We sleep in here.
For some reason, it's just safer here.

290
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,083
And it's just the two of you?

291
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:37,959
Yeah, well, um, his father...

292
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,875
Oh. Oh, hey, pumpkin!

293
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,000
- Um...
- Hey, buddy.

294
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:44,542
Do you wanna come out
and meet Mr. Matthias?

295
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,458
What's this you got?

296
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,083
Line of defense.

297
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,667
In your line of defense, do you have...

298
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,542
Action Guy?

299
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,834
Who's... Who's Action Guy?

300
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,625
You know Action Guy, right?

301
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:00,959
The one with the shoe? You remember him?

302
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,375
- As a weapon?
- Yes.

303
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,166
He uses the shoe as a weapon.

304
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,709
And he would say, he had a punch line,
he said something, it was, um...

305
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,250
- "Say it again!"
- Whoa.

306
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,375
"Say it again, boy!"

307
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,500
You don't remember that?

308
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,183
Oh, it's like <i>Abuelita</i> with the <i>chancla!</i>

309
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,333
Maybe it was just at my discount store.

310
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:18,542
But what about you?

311
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,458
I was a doctor in New York,

312
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:21,792
and my mother's from here.

313
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,434
And we just wanted to make a fresh start.

314
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,583
I always wanted to come back

315
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,500
and open a bed and breakfast.

316
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:31,875
Wow, that's an unfortunate
involuntary reaction.

317
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,542
Do you not like bed and breakfasts?

318
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:34,917
They're fine. It's just...

319
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:38,417
honestly I look at it like
a bunch of strangers getting together,

320
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,375
talking to each other, pleasantries.

321
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,500
"How you doin'?"
Blah, blah, blah, you know,

322
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,583
and really, if I'm being honest,
it totally is my worst nightmare.

323
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,125
Well, that's helpful.
Thank you.

324
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:54,208
Um, we just, you know,
don't have a lot of family.

325
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:55,959
Well, I found this place on Zillow.

326
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,208
I thought that this would be a great way

327
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,166
for my son to meet
new and interesting people.

328
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,810
He has trouble making friends.

329
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,083
Oh. Me, too.

330
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,250
And then things got really...

331
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,291
- bad.
- Terrible.

332
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:10,959
- Yeah.
- Anyway,

333
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:14,083
Father Kent mentioned
that you have this special camera lens.

334
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:15,709
Correct.

335
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,667
Okay, I think we'll start in this room.

336
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,500
Oh, wait, don't... don't use the flash!

337
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,417
And...

338
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:23,625
why?

339
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,125
They do not like that.

340
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,875
Maybe we start in the dining room
with the photos, hmm?

341
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:32,875
Oh.

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,208
I just...

343
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,792
moved these back.

344
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh!

345
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,166
It's in here now.

346
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,041
Y'all playin' tricks on me, huh?

347
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,978
No, you guys think this is funny, huh?

348
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,834
Playing jokes on me.

349
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,417
I'll check in here for some ghosts.

350
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,017
- No, don't...
- Don't touch him.

351
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:56,208
Don't touch him.

352
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,625
Nothin'.

353
00:19:57,709 --> 00:19:59,375
- Maybe take a photo?
- Photo?

354
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:00,834
Right.

355
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,834
That's what I'm here for.

356
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,208
Uh...

357
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,417
It's not doing it now,

358
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,291
but normally it will turn its head
and follow you.

359
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,583
It's absolutely terrifying.

360
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,542
- It is.
- I mean, I'm frazzled.

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,583
And... the basement.

362
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,625
Sometimes, I'll get, like, a sharp pain

363
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:34,417
on both of my sides when I walk this way.

364
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,959
So, gonna do it.

365
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,667
Ahh! Okay.

366
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:44,166
Ha! Okay.

367
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,709
All right.

368
00:20:46,792 --> 00:20:50,208
Hey, if you wanna just go back downstairs
and wait for us in your tent, that's okay.

369
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,291
- Okay, honey?
- No.

370
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,208
I wanna do this.

371
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,792
Okay, I got you. Mommy's got you.

372
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,250
You can do this.

373
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:58,959
My brave boy.

374
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,792
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

375
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,333
Okay! Okay. I'm here, I'm here.

376
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:08,750
You're okay, you're okay.

377
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,625
Oh. Oh. Oh, baby.

378
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,959
Why don't you just
mosey on over if it's so easy?

379
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,583
- All you have to do...
- You're okay, look at me.

380
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,583
Is one foot in front of the other.

381
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,667
Uh...

382
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,959
It's... It's really only after midnight.

383
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,625
Right.

384
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,768
Is this guy serious?

385
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,083
Clearly not.

386
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,667
Okay? My big boy.

387
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:50,125
Okay, I'm just doing
some final calculations here.

388
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,208
Good news.

389
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,041
No ghost.

390
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,792
- I know it can be scary.
- Hmm.

391
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:56,915
A big house like this

392
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:58,834
creaks in the night, cold drafts.

393
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,000
It happens.

394
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,750
But there's this thing called

395
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:04,291
the power of suggestion.

396
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,375
Yeah, I probably just need
to calm down, don't I?

397
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:08,875
Couldn't hurt.

398
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,542
<i>If ghosts exist,
what exactly are they?</i>

399
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,750
<i>Back on</i> Deadliest Catch...

400
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,667
<i>The storm
finally got done blowing here.</i>

401
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,792
<i>So we're gonna get started.</i>

402
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,917
<i>On the Bairdi grounds.</i>

403
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,208
<i>Get the rest of these pots on
and call it a Bairdi season for 2018.</i>

404
00:22:58,291 --> 00:22:59,500
<i>And be done, don't you agree?</i>

405
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,667
<i>I do agree.</i>

406
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,805
<i>Two days after setting on the...</i>

407
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,434
<i>For the believers,</i>

408
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,750
<i>ghosts are as real as the living.
And ghosts that...</i>

409
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,458
<i>Return to what they hope</i>

410
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:11,500
<i>is their final Bairdi haul.</i>

411
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,250
<i>Let's go, superstar.</i>

412
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,291
<i>As we'll find out, these orbs,</i>

413
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,125
<i>supposedly the energy signatures
of ghosts,</i>

414
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,041
<i>may simply mean it's...</i>

415
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,083
<i>the average.
That'll get us home.</i>

416
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,667
Oh.

417
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What?

418
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,208
But how?

419
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:13,667
Hey there! It's Ben, right?

420
00:24:16,709 --> 00:24:20,500
Oh, no, no, no.
Nope. Nope. No. Nope. Nope.

421
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:25,625
Okay. Let's try it now without the flash.

422
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:45,500
Power of suggestion.

423
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,542
Oh!

424
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:18,792
Whoa...

425
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,750
Oh! Aah!

426
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,333
Ahh!

427
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:35,875
Bad dream, Ben.

428
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:38,208
That's all it was. Just a bad dream.

429
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,625
What is happening?

430
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:45,917
What?

431
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,667
What, are you following me?

432
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:57,417
Okay. Everything's gonna be fine.

433
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,125
Whoa.

434
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:11,875
No, no, no!

435
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,291
Return!

436
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,250
Aah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

437
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,500
Ahh! Oh, oh, oh!

438
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,917
Right on time.

439
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,500
Something followed me home!

440
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,976
Come on, sweetie,
let's get this man

441
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,208
- some sheets.
- Hey!

442
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:57,875
Hold up, wait!

443
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,875
Don't.

444
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,166
Hey, I said,

445
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,291
something...

446
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,125
followed me home!

447
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,834
When I first caught wind

448
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,709
of what was going down here,

449
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,709
we were out.

450
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:16,500
I mean, do you think I'm going
to keep my son in a haunted house?

451
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,208
- No, you're not gonna...
- No, exactly.

452
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,250
But it didn't matter where we went.

453
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,875
These ghosts, and I...

454
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:26,375
suspect there might be quite a few.

455
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,333
They're like...

456
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,542
bed bugs.

457
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,625
If you step one foot in here,
they just latch on.

458
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,834
- Oh.
- We tried leaving the city,

459
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,166
moving from hotel to hotel,

460
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,500
but the hauntings just kept getting
worse and worse.

461
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,000
They forced us to come back here,
much like you.

462
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,267
So, what you could've done
is spoken to me like an adult

463
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,810
and told me that I could
never go home again.

464
00:27:45,834 --> 00:27:46,834
Oh, no, no, no.

465
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,709
You walked through that door.
I warned you.

466
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,059
You could have told me...

467
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,583
what was happening before.

468
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,166
Hi. Yeah.

469
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:56,250
You could have told me
before you let me just walk out of here...

470
00:27:56,417 --> 00:27:57,750
I would feel worse

471
00:27:57,917 --> 00:28:00,792
if you hadn't taken so much money

472
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,875
just to use a dead camera
and scribble nonsense.

473
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,750
I did do that.

474
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:07,375
Scone?

475
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,726
Yeah, it's a little late, right?

476
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,417
- They're good.
- They are.

477
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,166
I have a child.

478
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,166
He can't walk anywhere at night

479
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,250
without a ghost following him around.

480
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,083
So, I'm sorry,
but I will do anything to protect my son.

481
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,041
I get that...

482
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,166
but you don't need me.

483
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,291
You need an exorcist.

484
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:34,667
We tried that.

485
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:37,458
Same thing happened to me.

486
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:39,959
Oh, my God.

487
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:42,208
Ben, welcome.

488
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,041
- Surprise!
- Uh, how... You're...

489
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:46,792
You're in on this as well?
You knew about this the whole time?

490
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,059
You're supposed to be a priest!

491
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:51,000
What do you want me to say?
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.

492
00:28:51,083 --> 00:28:52,458
No, you are a monster!

493
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,667
- Hey, you got paid.
- Not enough.

494
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,041
I asked you, are you ready to be a hero?

495
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:59,208
And what did I say? I said, "No."

496
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,917
But your eyes were screaming yes!

497
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,333
Okay. Okay.

498
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,959
You said that he was an expert.

499
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,893
- An expert, I'm not an...
- He is an expert.

500
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:09,291
He just needs a little encouragement
from Coach Kent.

501
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,125
Now, does this thing work or not?

502
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,834
Actually, I, uh, took a photo.

503
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,720
'Twas blind but now we see.

504
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,500
I wasn't sure at first,

505
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,083
but I think it's that Mariner
from that painting upstairs.

506
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,667
Amazing Grace.

507
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:29,667
You know what?

508
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,041
Guys, now we can use Ben's camera

509
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,959
and identify every ghost
in this crooked mansion,

510
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,667
see what we're up against,
make it a fair fight.

511
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:40,474
Why are we talking about fighting ghosts?

512
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,726
I mean, we should be figuring out

513
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,291
how we got trapped here
and how we get our lives back.

514
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,458
Look, we're in a fight
whether we like it or not.

515
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:49,083
I feel like sometimes you're focusing
a little on the negative.

516
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:51,500
Yeah, uh, 'cause we're never
gonna go home again.

517
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,792
See, that's a downer.

518
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,583
Wait, our ghost kept wanting us to return.

519
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,792
- Yeah. Mine, too.
- Mine did, too.

520
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:01,476
I mean, she was missing half her face,
so it was hard to understand,

521
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,917
but she just kept saying,
"re-worm, re-worm."

522
00:30:04,083 --> 00:30:05,667
Wait, wait, they didn't wanna haunt us.

523
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:09,583
They want us
back here for some reason.

524
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:11,291
Oh!

525
00:30:12,834 --> 00:30:14,250
- It's midnight. Hurry!
- Yeah.

526
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,583
- Um...
- What happened?

527
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,917
After midnight,
we all stay together in this room.

528
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,250
It's safer that way.

529
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,625
Uh, Father Kent's claimed the blue couch.

530
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:22,792
Yeah, I mean...

531
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,810
unless you want to sleep there.

532
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,250
It's just I have a bad back,

533
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,226
you know, from all the feet
that I cleaned in Calcutta.

534
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,250
Take the couch.

535
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,375
Sleep all you want.

536
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:34,333
If they want us here,
I'm gonna find out why.

537
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,375
Hey... Hey, where are you going?

538
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,935
You're not supposed to leave
after midnight!

539
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:41,375
You're breaking the rules, stop!

540
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:42,542
Mom!

541
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,792
These people are...

542
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,458
Hello? Anyone?

543
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,834
Gabbie?

544
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:01,917
Travis?

545
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:07,792
Nope.

546
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:11,041
Nope. Nah-uh.

547
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:28,208
Did I frighten you?

548
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,875
Good, you should be frightened.

549
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:35,875
He's going to be so excited you're here.
He loves guests.

550
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:37,625
Whoa!

551
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:38,893
Ben, are you...

552
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

553
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:43,166
- What?
- Ben, are you okay?

554
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,959
We're gonna need more help.

555
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:50,888
It's time to assemble
the Dream Team.

556
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:52,542
That's the nickname I'm giving us.

557
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,145
Uh, I'm pretty sure that's taken.

558
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,959
First thing we need to do

559
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,917
is figure out what happened in this house.

560
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,792
That's why I've contacted
the foremost historian

561
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:04,208
on Greek revival manors in this area.

562
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,875
- Now, he's dead.
- Oh.

563
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:08,834
But I quickly pivoted,
'cause that's what the Dream Team does,

564
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,166
<i>and I discovered
there's a professor at Tulane</i>

565
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:14,500
<i>who wrote a book on haunted mansions
in Louisiana.</i>

566
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,208
<i>Only sold about nine copies,</i>

567
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:18,291
<i>but, hey, he's not dead.</i>

568
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:19,375
Professor?

569
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:20,917
Look, if you're coming down here

570
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,125
to talk about your grades,
turn right around

571
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,309
- and walk on out...
- Uh, no.

572
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,393
Because I'm gonna dock ya!

573
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:26,643
We're actually not students.

574
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,458
I, uh, got a question for you,
though, sir.

575
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:32,917
Do you know anything about this place?

576
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,625
Well, science begins with observation.

577
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,917
<i>So, I'll take pictures
of all of these ghosts</i>

578
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,250
<i>to make sure we know exactly
what we're dealing with.</i>

579
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,667
<i>Great. And once we know
what we're dealing with,</i>

580
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,166
we're gonna need someone
who can talk to these ghosts.

581
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,250
A psychic.

582
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:51,208
<i>I did find one within our price range.</i>

583
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,625
<i>She's been doing readings at Bar Mitzvahs,</i>

584
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:55,792
but gets a very solid Yelp score.

585
00:32:58,083 --> 00:33:00,000
Make yourselves comfortable.

586
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,041
Who is Mitchell?

587
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,458
- I... I don't know.
- Think a little harder.

588
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,875
I meet a lot of people in my parish,
so I guess it's possible that...

589
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,434
He doesn't know anyone named Mitchell.

590
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,166
What about Giovanni?

591
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,250
No,

592
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,643
- I don't think so...
- Gary?

593
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,709
Have you recently met someone named Gary?

594
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:20,291
Okay, so now we're just thinking of names
that start with "G"?

595
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:21,792
Okay, so that's a "no" on Gary?

596
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,667
Actually, she's good.
You're very good. That...

597
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,792
No, I did know a Cousin Gary
in my neighborhood.

598
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,542
- Thank you so much for today.
- You're lying.

599
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:32,375
You haven't met a Gary.

600
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:35,041
Have you met someone named Gabbie?

601
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,333
<i>Keep me in a daydream</i>

602
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,834
<i>Keep me going strong</i>

603
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:46,000
Baby's got to be home before dark!

604
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:48,583
Why do you
have to get home so soon?

605
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:51,250
Saw those boys chasing you.

606
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,834
They were just running me home.

607
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,417
I think they just need...

608
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,208
a little bit more time to get to know me.

609
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,709
- Yeah.
- I see that you're busy.

610
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,250
<i>Super</i>

611
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,125
<i>Superstition</i>

612
00:34:07,208 --> 00:34:09,041
<i>Oh, super</i>

613
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,125
<i>Superstition</i>

614
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:14,667
That house has a string
of traumatic events.

615
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:15,834
Explosions.

616
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:16,959
Quicksand.

617
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,375
In Louisiana!

618
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,959
That family might want to move.

619
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,625
Now eat up. Happy Hour ends at 6:00!

620
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:25,041
Okay?

621
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,291
One more time.

622
00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:28,375
One more time. Open.

623
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,291
Are you kidding me?

624
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,208
So much activity during midnight.

625
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:39,976
See, I tried to get a read on the ghosts,

626
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,750
but it's hard because
they just won't stop moving.

627
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,166
They're not just moving.

628
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,667
I know this feeling.
They're running from something.

629
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,500
Thank you
for inviting me, Father Kent.

630
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,834
Who's reimbursing my mileage?

631
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:00,834
Mm!

632
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,834
People...

633
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:04,917
used to...

634
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,333
eat here.

635
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,333
I told you she's good.

636
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:12,333
No, it's a dining room.

637
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,917
Sometime after 1788,

638
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,750
the mansion was discovered fully built.

639
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,583
No land had ever been worked.

640
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,834
The earliest record I could dig up

641
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,375
is this deed

642
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,583
acquired by William Gracey.

643
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:33,709
<i>He purchased it
from a previously undisclosed owner.</i>

644
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:37,166
<i>His wife, Eleanor, died of yellow fever.</i>

645
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:40,792
That's when things started to get weird.

646
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:42,959
Isn't this great?

647
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:46,041
I mean, I've been dying
to go to this place for 60 years.

648
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,667
That's why we came to you,
because you've got a vision.

649
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,059
Guys, I gotta see this.

650
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,834
I'm having heart surgery next week.

651
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,166
You...

652
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,208
- You cannot come.
- I need to come.

653
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,375
- No.
- No, I need to come!

654
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,625
I guess it's not a good idea.
It's a long ways away.

655
00:35:58,709 --> 00:36:00,101
Sixty years
I've tried to get in there!

656
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,351
Well, I can follow you,

657
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,667
- I've got a car.
- Do not come!

658
00:36:03,834 --> 00:36:05,291
Then I guess you don't need these.

659
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,875
All right, all right,
you do what you're doing,

660
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,333
- I'll go use the restroom and...
- Good. Okay.

661
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,875
- Run, run! Run! Go, run!
- What?

662
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,542
- Okay, I'll start the car!
- Go!

663
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:16,917
Hey, help, help!

664
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,875
So strong!

665
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,166
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

666
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,333
Fire, fire, fire. Fire, fire, fire. Oh!

667
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:27,709
If there's an evil spirit here,
only a banishment will do.

668
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,709
And let me tell you, it will fight back.

669
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:31,834
Ghosts like to fight.

670
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,250
For example, 1813,

671
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:35,792
a group of mediums

672
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,959
went into the house
just a little north of here.

673
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,917
It took 21 days.

674
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:44,917
They worked their butts off and they got
that deceased owner out of there.

675
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,917
But they were all found...

676
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:48,917
Uh, how old are you?

677
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Nine.

678
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,834
Okay. I'm talkin' organs on the outside.

679
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,500
- Oh, come on.
- Nine is young!

680
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:57,667
It's not that young, girl.
I was drivin' by nine.

681
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,291
Look, I know that might have been
an extreme example.

682
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:03,041
- Yes!
- But they were a group of amateurs.

683
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,875
I am a professional. Okay?

684
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:10,792
I'm bona fide and qualified, certified,
and I can get rid of what died.

685
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:12,243
Well, I don't doubt it.

686
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,834
I've sensed
a lot of grief in this house.

687
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,208
And grief, unprocessed,
will make a spirit stuck.

688
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,458
Okay, well, can you help us
unstick them, then?

689
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:21,542
I can do it.

690
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:23,208
But I would need a week, paid,

691
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,500
where I can recharge my crystals
and begin doing my research.

692
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,208
And then, we can get to it.

693
00:37:28,291 --> 00:37:31,041
I'll send you a invoice from PayPal
in the meantime.

694
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,458
Bye-bye.

695
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:36,417
Nice meeting you!

696
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:42,000
<i>You didn't tell me
that these ghosts be following people!</i>

697
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:44,792
I know your mama
gots to be disappointed in you.

698
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,625
I know she disappointed in you

699
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:49,000
'cause I'm pretty sure
she taught you better than this!

700
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,291
I knew this was weird.

701
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,250
All these freaky, different-looking people

702
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,267
living in the same place.

703
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,291
How's she doing?

704
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:56,917
She's pissed.

705
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,375
What you have done

706
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:02,625
is deeply wrong
and absolutely unforgivable.

707
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:06,000
The ghost that followed me home
was on a horse.

708
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:11,875
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have a ghost horse

709
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,667
charging through your bedroom?

710
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,792
Now, I've decided
to be the bigger person and help you.

711
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:19,709
Mostly because you have left me
no other options.

712
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,625
So, tell me,

713
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,000
what happened in this house?

714
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,083
Wow, these are beautiful.

715
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,458
These blueprints that you...

716
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,041
borrowed

717
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:34,365
- are incredible.
- Come on.

718
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:38,000
Am I proud of the fact
that Ben attacked an elderly educator?

719
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,959
Of course not. That being said,

720
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,750
totally worth it.

721
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:44,375
These papers say what happened
in this house.

722
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:47,625
Widower Gracey lost his mind
and took his own life.

723
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,959
Suffering from grief.
Didn't I say I sensed grief?

724
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,959
And apparently, he spent all his money
on some psychic or something.

725
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,125
"Medium." We're called mediums.

726
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,208
- Oh, a medium.
- Thank you.

727
00:38:57,291 --> 00:39:00,625
I guess, subsequently after that,
66 people moved into this house,

728
00:39:00,792 --> 00:39:03,709
and each one of them
died a spectacularly terrible,

729
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,542
oddly specific death.

730
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,458
<i>Two brothers shot each other in a duel.</i>

731
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12,583
<i>And this wife chopped up
five of her husbands.</i>

732
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,000
So, Gracey must be the key
to stopping this.

733
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:17,875
What was the medium's name?

734
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,291
Um, Madame Leoto, I think.

735
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,959
Madame Leota?

736
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:25,250
Madame Leota was the greatest medium ever.

737
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:26,917
Sought after by the royals

738
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,375
and rich people.

739
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:29,685
Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

740
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:33,458
This is, uh, a letter from William Gracey
to Madame Leota,

741
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:36,250
asking her to come to his seance room.

742
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,667
But we don't have a seance room.

743
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,750
You sure?

744
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,834
Wait.

745
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:44,208
There isn't a room
at the end of that hallway.

746
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:49,709
See?

747
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,417
Nothing here. It's just...

748
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,250
Wait, wait! Hold it.

749
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,333
I got it.

750
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,166
Wow, you just...

751
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,792
- Okay, that...
- Oh, yeah.

752
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,834
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

753
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:15,125
Wait, what? Okay.

754
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,025
Be careful, there's a step.

755
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:48,792
Ugh! Smells mildewy.

756
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,083
Mmm.

757
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,208
- Hmm.
- Wow.

758
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,709
Mm.

759
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:58,792
What's that?

760
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,083
Oh!

761
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,166
Oil.

762
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:07,458
Wait, I think I know what this is.
One second here.

763
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:16,625
Okay.

764
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:22,875
Oh.

765
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,083
Oh, my God.

766
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,834
This hasn't been touched in centuries.

767
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:35,834
Maybe I'll just do
a little blessing.

768
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:38,500
A prayer to get us started
on the right foot.

769
00:41:39,375 --> 00:41:41,125
God, give us a break.

770
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:44,000
We... We don't want to be haunted,

771
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:47,000
and it just seems like
there's so many bad people in the world.

772
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,083
Haunt them.

773
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,834
How about an "amen" at the count of three?
One, two, three, amen!

774
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,041
Amen.

775
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:54,728
Are you sure he's a priest?

776
00:41:55,125 --> 00:41:58,208
Now, if I can communicate
with William Gracey,

777
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:02,166
I suspect he will have the answers
that we need.

778
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,500
And just to confirm,

779
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:08,542
the only thing available to us
is this French Vanilla Yankee Candle?

780
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,250
Yeah, I keep forgetting...

781
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,226
to cancel my subscription to Amazon,
so it just...

782
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,208
Please, hold hands.

783
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,625
Now, I will quiet my mind

784
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,500
so that I can communicate
with the other side.

785
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,542
Please do not interrupt me.

786
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:28,349
Otherwise I have to start all over again.

787
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:29,667
Of course.

788
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:57,417
- She asleep. Look. She asleep.
- No, no, no. She's in a...

789
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,250
Hey, she's in a trance.

790
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:00,542
It's a...

791
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:03,333
- Wait, is she asleep?
- She's asleep.

792
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:04,518
Is she sleeping? Or is it just a trance?

793
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:05,810
I'm looking right at her.
She's asleep.

794
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,125
Can I do this?

795
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,375
- Okay.
- Now you got me all mad!

796
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,458
We're sorry.

797
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,709
Please do get peaceful again.

798
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:25,750
Okay, it...

799
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:28,226
- Why...
- Maybe she's narcoleptic?

800
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,434
I don't... I don't...

801
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:31,709
Who goes there?

802
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,000
Spirits,

803
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,291
I come here with good intent.

804
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:40,125
I summon the spirit of William Gracey.

805
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:42,041
If you are here with us,

806
00:43:42,125 --> 00:43:45,166
give us a sign!

807
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,500
He's with us.

808
00:43:58,542 --> 00:43:59,834
Why are you here?

809
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:02,083
Why are you hanging on?

810
00:44:02,834 --> 00:44:06,000
If you have a message
that you'd like to leave us,

811
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:07,667
or a greeting of sorts,

812
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:09,625
here's a pen and pad

813
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:12,208
that I purchased from CVS.

814
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,375
Whoa.

815
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,875
Ben, camera!

816
00:44:33,041 --> 00:44:34,792
Go, go, go! Come on, come on!

817
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:45,000
Wow! It's Gracey!

818
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:46,917
Oh.

819
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
He's gone.

820
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,625
What does it say?

821
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,709
{\an8}"Talk to Leota."

822
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:05,041
You really can speak to the dead.

823
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,458
Mm.

824
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,625
Of course.

825
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,375
Can you contact someone for me?

826
00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:13,959
Who?

827
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:23,083
My wife.

828
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:28,166
You were the grieving spirit.

829
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,542
Her name's Alyssa.

830
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:39,125
Yes.

831
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,291
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

832
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,125
I can't.

833
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,083
I don't think she's here.

834
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,270
Could you see if Leota's here?

835
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,542
Oh.

836
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,250
This feels different.

837
00:46:03,375 --> 00:46:04,959
What does this feel like?

838
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:06,917
Madness.

839
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,166
Whoa, whoa!

840
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,959
Harriet, summon Leota!

841
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,500
I summon Madame Leota!

842
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:19,917
No!

843
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,959
No!

844
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,583
Come on! Oh, my goodness!

845
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,208
- Help me!
- Harriet!

846
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:31,917
Okay, okay, wait, wait.

847
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,250
No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

848
00:46:38,291 --> 00:46:39,976
I wanted to get out of here,
but not like this!

849
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,434
- Harriet!
- Harriet. Come on!

850
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:45,750
Harriet!

851
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:47,667
Harriet, come on.

852
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,583
We made it mad!

853
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,959
I did not know it was gonna be a spa day.

854
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,709
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

855
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,250
Is that Bruce?

856
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:01,250
- Hey! Wait!
- Stop! No!

857
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,083
- Who is this?
- Bruce!

858
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:06,125
Do not go in, Bruce! Don't go in!

859
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:10,709
You steal my stuff, leave me flat!

860
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,125
I'll show you!

861
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,500
I will see this house,
and nothing's gonna stop me.

862
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,709
Oh!

863
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:23,667
Bruce!

864
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:25,917
- Help!
- Bruce!

865
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:29,500
Grandma, you know, Grandma.

866
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:35,166
Ahh! I'm too old to die! It's not...

867
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,083
Oh, oh. Whoa. Whoa!

868
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,417
I'm curious why a man his age

869
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:48,125
- was riding a chair down a main road?
- A chair...

870
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,291
- Uh...
- Um...

871
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:52,542
- He loves to do that.
- He likes to ride chairs.

872
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,351
- Yeah, it's kind of his thing.
- So, it's his thing.

873
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:55,667
I don't like the chair!

874
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,875
Okay, well, let's put a pin in that.

875
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,281
Make sure he gets lots of rest.

876
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,373
- Rest. Okay.
- Okay?

877
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:01,685
Yeah.

878
00:48:01,709 --> 00:48:02,949
And no more excitement,

879
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,208
or next time
it might not be a false alarm.

880
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,375
Now, he said that he does live alone,
so I'd like to keep him overnight.

881
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:11,083
Um, yeah, maybe get some fluids.

882
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:12,834
You know, uh...

883
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,208
- No, look, look.
- No?

884
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,291
- No. No!
- No.

885
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:17,834
- Oh, my goodness!
- Um, we should go.

886
00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:19,017
- We should really go.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

887
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,101
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

888
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,393
We're not going to leave you.

889
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:22,500
Relax, relax.

890
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,417
We should all go home now.

891
00:48:25,709 --> 00:48:28,375
First he's trapping us here,
now he's dragging us out.

892
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,166
Enough! Make up your mind.

893
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,750
Well, this isn't Gracey.

894
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:34,917
Whatever evil this is
doesn't want us to talk to Leota.

895
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:37,333
It sees us as a threat now.

896
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,208
Let's just go find Leota
and see what she has to say.

897
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:41,893
Is there anyone
that we need to contact

898
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,184
to let them know that you're here

899
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,208
so they don't worry?

900
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,709
Well, there is a woman.

901
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:48,041
I make her take my trash down for me.

902
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,709
- She's...
- Yeah, I bet she'll be okay.

903
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:51,792
- Yes.
- Yeah.

904
00:48:51,875 --> 00:48:52,935
Go on, I don't wanna play now.

905
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:54,017
I need to check your pulse.
Let me...

906
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,101
Hey, my love, boundaries.

907
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:56,434
Go on, go on. Get out of here.

908
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:57,917
- Boundaries.
- Well...

909
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:00,834
I'm sorry to hear
about your wife passing.

910
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,458
It's good that she's not here.

911
00:49:04,125 --> 00:49:07,041
The living and the dead belong
in different places.

912
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,250
See...

913
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,875
this is our world

914
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,458
and this is the Region Beyond.

915
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:18,417
And the place where they overlap most

916
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:22,041
is where the living can encounter the dead
through hauntings.

917
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,834
Like this house.

918
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:28,250
But when a soul passes
and goes over into the Region Beyond,

919
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:31,500
if it's at peace, that's where it stays.

920
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:33,917
It's good that she's not here.

921
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:36,208
She's at peace.

922
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:39,417
And I bet she wants you to be too.

923
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,875
I know this might sound silly,

924
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:46,458
but I believe that souls
can send signs from the Region Beyond.

925
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:51,083
My father passed away,
and he loved model trains.

926
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,083
He would take them apart

927
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,458
and put them
back together again every day.

928
00:49:57,709 --> 00:50:00,583
But on those days when I get really low...

929
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:03,917
I mean really low...

930
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,750
I will randomly hear

931
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:11,125
a train off in the distance.

932
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:15,583
And I know that's my dad saying "Hi."

933
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,458
Those moments

934
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:22,959
are called ghost winks.

935
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,250
Ben.

936
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,458
Sorry to be so familiar.

937
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:22,875
I just feel I know you already.

938
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,834
You see, we have a friend in common.

939
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:29,375
Alyssa?

940
00:51:32,917 --> 00:51:33,959
Alyssa!

941
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:38,041
Alyssa?

942
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,625
I wouldn't go in there...

943
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:48,208
unless you want a ticket
to the Region Beyond!

944
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,291
Take us with you?

945
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:55,917
We know you're heading
that way soon!

946
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,041
Alyssa!

947
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:12,750
Alyssa.

948
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:18,333
- Ben! Ben!
- Mm. What, what, what?

949
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:21,208
Bruce disappeared
and something's happening.

950
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,834
All right, I'm going after him.

951
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,291
All right, here, give me these.

952
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,938
- No, it's after midnight!
- No!

953
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,792
- I got you covered.
- Harriet!

954
00:52:35,959 --> 00:52:37,719
I'm gonna cover us
with some morning prayers.

955
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,041
It's the middle of the night!

956
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,250
Not in Rome.

957
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:52,417
Do you see anything?

958
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:54,041
No, but I feel something.

959
00:52:55,667 --> 00:52:57,875
Bruce, don't...
What are you doing out here?

960
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,792
We got to find Leota.

961
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,500
What about the attic?

962
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,417
I don't know about this.
Attics are historically terrifying.

963
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,792
Is it cold?
It's starting to feel colder.

964
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:10,851
Well, you don't
have any pants on, Bruce.

965
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:12,166
Can't you guys both just...

966
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,500
Oh, dang.

967
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:19,375
- Whoa!
- All right.

968
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,166
Whoa.

969
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:28,542
- Go on up!
- Bruce, wait!

970
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:30,333
Bruce, I need you to protect me!

971
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:31,417
Let go! What?

972
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,559
Bruce, stay here and protect me!

973
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:33,726
You have a heart condition. Come on.

974
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,310
All right, all right, all right.

975
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:36,583
Protect me.

976
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:39,834
All right.

977
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,041
Be safe up there.

978
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,709
Uh... Hello?

979
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,375
Uh... Madame Leota?

980
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,542
We... We need your help.

981
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:10,959
- Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
- Whoa!

982
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,834
Did you do that?

983
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:16,500
No, I did not!

984
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:35,125
Leota? Is that you?

985
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:53,250
Huh?

986
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:02,417
Closer.

987
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:05,500
Closer.

988
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,542
Oh, okay. Ahh!

989
00:55:18,625 --> 00:55:20,125
I want out of here!

990
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,691
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

991
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,333
Holy!

992
00:55:25,834 --> 00:55:27,000
Whoa.

993
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:32,000
Hey, hey, hey.

994
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:35,250
Hey, listen, I'm sure
those guys deserved what they got,

995
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:36,875
but, baby, baby, listen,

996
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:38,441
I know you can hear me, okay, babe?

997
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,041
Ghost Bae. Can I call you Ghost Bae?

998
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:41,792
But me, I'm different. I'm a supporter.

999
00:55:41,959 --> 00:55:44,458
I'm an ally, to you, and to all women...

1000
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:02,959
Whoa!

1001
00:56:03,041 --> 00:56:04,881
- It's a little musty.
- Oh, acrid.

1002
00:56:04,959 --> 00:56:06,250
- Oh, wow.
- Ah, it stinks.

1003
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:07,792
Contaminated.

1004
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,208
Ooh.

1005
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:14,333
All right. So, it says, uh...

1006
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:17,834
Here. "Property of Madame Leota.

1007
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,208
"If this does not belong to you...

1008
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,625
"Do not turn

1009
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:24,667
"another page."

1010
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,959
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Hey, Harriet!

1011
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:31,792
This is Madame Leota's
personal book of incantations!

1012
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:33,041
Oh, my God!

1013
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,365
I mean, one of us had to do it.

1014
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:37,041
Dreams do come true.
Oh, my goodness!

1015
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:39,000
Damn, what is that?

1016
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:40,667
That's nice.

1017
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,208
A crystal ball.

1018
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:44,500
Is this worth anything?

1019
00:56:46,542 --> 00:56:47,542
Hey!

1020
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,583
Ma'am, we can see you. Hi.

1021
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:57,917
- Oh.
- Madame Leota?

1022
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:00,166
Well, it's about time.

1023
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,500
Very powerful book you're holding.

1024
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:06,083
Best know how to use it.

1025
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,570
How did you get in there?

1026
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,333
I can show you what happened,
but it will cost you...

1027
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:12,959
Mm?

1028
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,041
Three dollars.

1029
00:57:15,959 --> 00:57:16,959
- What?
- Wow.

1030
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,125
That's highway robbery!

1031
00:57:18,208 --> 00:57:19,968
That's fine, that's fine.
Shh, shh. Go ahead.

1032
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,875
<i>William Gracey, lost in grief,</i>

1033
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:32,917
<i>sought me out to contact
his deceased wife.</i>

1034
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,917
Eleanor Gracey!

1035
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,166
Rap on a table, it's time to respond.

1036
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,000
Open a bridge to the Region Beyond!

1037
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:47,291
<i>When she didn't come back to him,</i>

1038
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:50,166
<i>we called for her again and again.</i>

1039
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,041
<i>A seance every midnight, for a year.</i>

1040
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:54,709
For a year? That's so reckless.

1041
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,041
Who said that?

1042
00:58:01,166 --> 00:58:06,166
<i>The repeated seances opened the floodgates
of the ghost realm.</i>

1043
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:09,792
<i>Hundreds of spirits freely came and went,</i>

1044
00:58:09,959 --> 00:58:12,000
<i>but never his beloved Eleanor.</i>

1045
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,041
<i>I begged him to stop,</i>

1046
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:17,333
<i>for fear of what we might
accidentally call forth.</i>

1047
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
<i>But he insisted we keep going.</i>

1048
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:24,625
<i>Soon, Gracey was receiving messages
from Eleanor</i>

1049
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,875
<i>imploring him to join her
on the other side.</i>

1050
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:31,542
<i>But I knew this wasn't Eleanor.</i>

1051
00:58:32,917 --> 00:58:35,542
<i>We had summoned a terrible evil</i>

1052
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:38,458
<i>who fed on Gracey's grief.</i>

1053
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:44,417
<i>This was no ordinary ghost.</i>

1054
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,250
<i>He had the power</i>

1055
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:51,667
<i>to trap these once happy souls
in this house.</i>

1056
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,917
Mine!

1057
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:04,166
<i>Before I could get a look at him,</i>

1058
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,917
his dark spirit trapped me
in my own crystal ball.

1059
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:10,458
Who knows how long.

1060
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:13,208
Probably months now.

1061
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:19,375
He has trapped 933 souls.

1062
00:59:19,709 --> 00:59:23,041
But he needs 1,000 to complete the ritual

1063
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:25,583
that will let him escape this house.

1064
00:59:26,375 --> 00:59:30,458
Beware the full moon,
when he is most powerful.

1065
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,875
You won't survive it.

1066
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:36,291
Oh, there's much grief in you.

1067
00:59:38,083 --> 00:59:42,083
You will be most vulnerable
to his manipulations.

1068
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,083
Not on our watch. We got you.

1069
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,458
But what are you gonna do?

1070
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,458
- Yeah.
- They're already dead!

1071
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:52,768
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be deader.

1072
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:53,792
Okay.

1073
00:59:53,959 --> 00:59:55,875
You know what we need?
We need a banishment.

1074
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,079
- Yeah.
- A banishment!

1075
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,792
Yes, a banishment,

1076
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:03,959
but it requires an object
the spirit once possessed.

1077
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,333
Once you have that...

1078
01:00:05,417 --> 01:00:06,417
Enough!

1079
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:16,500
We're okay.
Let's find a banishing. Okay, so...

1080
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,500
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

1081
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:22,333
but there's been 66 deaths in this house

1082
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,875
since that ball lady was trapped there!

1083
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:27,959
So, he doesn't have 933.

1084
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,166
He's got 999.

1085
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,917
And unless one of you
wants to start funeral arrangements,

1086
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:34,417
we better get out of here.

1087
01:00:39,166 --> 01:00:40,625
Shoo! Shoo!

1088
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,792
Am I the only one
who didn't know that was real?

1089
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,792
Um, we better hurry this up

1090
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:49,083
'cause all these seances
got the house acting up.

1091
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:50,834
Never mind that,

1092
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:52,917
every one of the deaths
that happened in this house

1093
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,250
happened on a full moon.

1094
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:57,583
Which means, we have less than four days.

1095
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:01,000
Didn't Madame Leota say something
about needing an object they possessed?

1096
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,627
How are you gonna find
an object someone possessed

1097
01:01:04,792 --> 01:01:06,432
when you don't know who the "someone" is?

1098
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:09,750
Now, there is something
very special that I can do.

1099
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,333
It's quite extraordinary.

1100
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,750
My spirit will leave my body
and go into the ghost realm,

1101
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:17,875
where I can get a look at that spirit.

1102
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,500
A reverse seance, if you will.

1103
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:20,959
A reverse seance?

1104
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:22,125
Count me in!

1105
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:26,083
Bruce, it's very dangerous.
Not just anyone can do a reverse seance.

1106
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,291
Astral projection.

1107
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:29,083
Just say "astral projection."

1108
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,959
You don't need to use all these words
as if you just invented them.

1109
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:33,645
- It's ridiculous.
- Astral projection?

1110
01:01:33,709 --> 01:01:36,229
Have you ever heard of astral projection?
Is that in your Bible?

1111
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,291
Let's talk about
what really is ridiculous.

1112
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:39,959
Harriet, Harriet, okay, listen.

1113
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,125
Come on,
we're all on the same team here.

1114
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:45,792
Although we're not actin' like one,
and that plays into their hands.

1115
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:48,208
Hey, I like the idea of a reverse seance.

1116
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:51,000
Yeah, they've been coming into our realm,
let's go visit them.

1117
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,417
Oh, you're gonna scare us?
No, we're gonna scare you!

1118
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,500
- Yeah!
- Boo!

1119
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:59,000
Yes! We will find
this evil spirit tonight!

1120
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:04,041
Just, uh, pick the shells out. It's fine.

1121
01:02:05,959 --> 01:02:08,500
You make crunchy scrambled eggs?

1122
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,625
My grandma used to do that
back in the day.

1123
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,667
That's when her glasses started.

1124
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,583
Her prescription...

1125
01:02:16,542 --> 01:02:17,542
How's he doing?

1126
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:21,917
I fear he may be a little young
to be processing

1127
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:24,500
existential dread.

1128
01:02:26,083 --> 01:02:28,166
You know, I thought that coming down here,

1129
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,333
we could put everything

1130
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:31,257
that we went through
with his father behind us.

1131
01:02:31,291 --> 01:02:34,083
You know, he could run around,
be a kid, enjoy,

1132
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,000
but this house just won't
let that happen.

1133
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,125
- Oh, it's scary.
- No more eggs.

1134
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:41,417
Speaking of egg-sistential.

1135
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,208
"Egg-sistential"?

1136
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:47,166
Oh, my God.

1137
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:49,253
He's gonna fall off that stoop
and break his leg.

1138
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,500
- Travis!
- Hey.

1139
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:51,663
Travis!

1140
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:54,250
Hey, how 'bout I go talk to him?

1141
01:02:54,417 --> 01:02:55,417
Okay, just...

1142
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:59,291
- don't egg him on.
- Eggs-actly.

1143
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,583
We have to stop this.

1144
01:03:01,667 --> 01:03:03,417
- I'll be back.
- Thank you.

1145
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:04,667
Go team.

1146
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:18,875
That's him landing.

1147
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,500
That is not how a flying guy sounds.

1148
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,458
You're right. True.

1149
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:26,625
Um...

1150
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:29,667
What's wrong?

1151
01:03:31,291 --> 01:03:34,875
Kids at school
are having a birthday party tonight.

1152
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,458
Can't go, of course.

1153
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:40,500
Not that I was invited.

1154
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:41,935
- It's crunchy.
- It's crunchy.

1155
01:03:41,959 --> 01:03:43,142
There's a lot of crunch in there.

1156
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:45,333
Yeah,
it's like the Cap'n Crunch of eggs.

1157
01:03:51,166 --> 01:03:52,625
I don't know why they don't like me.

1158
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:53,792
I mean...

1159
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:57,083
I dress my best every day,

1160
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,458
I always raise my hand in class,

1161
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,059
and I make sure...

1162
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:03,003
everybody follows the rules
on the playground.

1163
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:04,250
Yep, well,

1164
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:07,208
I think you just answered
your own question right there.

1165
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:10,417
I talked to my dad today.

1166
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:14,000
Yeah, that's good.

1167
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,458
He wants me to come visit.

1168
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:23,500
But I think it would make my mom feel bad.

1169
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,291
Don't tell her.

1170
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:31,208
It'll make her so sad.

1171
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:36,083
Well, if there's one thing I'm good at,
it's keeping secrets.

1172
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:39,291
And you know what?

1173
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:41,709
Aah!

1174
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:43,750
That was a good one, yeah.

1175
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,959
Just in there kicking me for some reason.

1176
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,417
Ow! Action Guy.

1177
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,041
Here.

1178
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:54,625
Go ahead, take it. Yeah.

1179
01:04:54,709 --> 01:04:57,458
Oh, whoa. Be careful. He's cheap.

1180
01:04:57,625 --> 01:05:00,083
You know, I was gonna ask you
if you wanted to...

1181
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:01,166
Actually, you...

1182
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:08,166
"Say it again!"

1183
01:05:09,083 --> 01:05:10,333
Oh!

1184
01:05:11,834 --> 01:05:15,583
Ah, you got that. All right, all right,
all right, you won, you won.

1185
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:17,375
Hey. Hey, give me Soulsucker!

1186
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:18,938
- Hey, come back!
- "Say it again!"

1187
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:22,166
Dark spirit, whoever you are,

1188
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:24,000
Harriet's comin' for ya.

1189
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:25,250
Oh, yeah.

1190
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:27,583
That's got some mojo to it.

1191
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:31,041
A little Dragon's Blood? Yerba Santa?
What are we talking about?

1192
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:32,834
Sage from Costco.

1193
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,542
When I leave my body
to look at this dark spirit,

1194
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:37,875
I don't want anyone else jumping in it.

1195
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:40,125
Not that I think it will get to that.

1196
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:42,500
I've done it a thousand times.

1197
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:44,101
You see, if you say it like that,

1198
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,476
it makes me feel like
you've never done it.

1199
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:46,542
Yes, I have.

1200
01:05:46,625 --> 01:05:48,305
I've probably done it, like, 10,000 times.

1201
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:49,875
Why elevate it to that level?

1202
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:51,458
Then I don't believe it at all.

1203
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:54,000
- How am I gonna get into this?
- Believe it, boo. Believe it.

1204
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,667
Now, if I'm gone for more than 10 minutes,

1205
01:05:57,834 --> 01:05:59,291
ring this bell.

1206
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,834
If I get lost,
it'll help me find my way back.

1207
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:06,417
See, I have to be very raw
in order to go into the other side.

1208
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,375
This is a picture of my dog

1209
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:11,542
that tragically moved

1210
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:13,250
to live on a farm.

1211
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,180
Actually he got hit by a car.

1212
01:06:16,667 --> 01:06:19,375
Bursted like a water balloon.

1213
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:20,458
Sis!

1214
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:22,166
- Wait, what?
- What?

1215
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,500
We're gonna start.

1216
01:06:24,208 --> 01:06:28,709
"Spirits, I come with curious intentions.

1217
01:06:29,458 --> 01:06:32,375
"Creak open the door to your dimension.

1218
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:35,625
"Protect my body as I leave this helm.

1219
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:40,291
"For now, my spirit
will enter the ghost realm."

1220
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,000
Think sad thoughts, think sad thoughts.

1221
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,875
Think sad thoughts, think sad thoughts.

1222
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:06,291
Whoa.

1223
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,375
Whoa!

1224
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:29,625
Eleanor?

1225
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,375
Gracey! Hey, we need your help!

1226
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:34,667
You shouldn't be here.

1227
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:38,041
Hey!

1228
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:51,333
Gracey, wait! I want to talk to you.

1229
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:54,834
Whoa!

1230
01:08:11,041 --> 01:08:12,750
One, two,

1231
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:17,834
three, four, five, six, seven.

1232
01:08:35,959 --> 01:08:38,667
Now, baby, you know I love the blues,

1233
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,083
but can you play something
a little more...

1234
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
light?

1235
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:44,917
This is all he wants to hear.

1236
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:48,875
Keep drinking.
It'll get lighter.

1237
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,041
Don't let him catch you here.

1238
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,083
Eleanor?

1239
01:09:09,709 --> 01:09:10,709
Gracey?

1240
01:09:11,083 --> 01:09:12,792
Gracey, you have to help me.

1241
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,500
Ah.

1242
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,750
Ben,

1243
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:17,500
this is all my fault.

1244
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,917
This dark spirit, who is he?

1245
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,542
No one knows his mortal name,

1246
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:23,333
but he's not one of us.

1247
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,917
His power in this realm is beyond control,

1248
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,500
with many of us forced to do his bidding.

1249
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:32,875
Please, you must not let him
take the last soul.

1250
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:35,250
Or we'll all be trapped here forever.

1251
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,625
Wait. He's coming now.

1252
01:09:38,709 --> 01:09:39,709
Leave now!

1253
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:40,792
Gracey!

1254
01:09:43,709 --> 01:09:45,250
Oh, no, he's here!

1255
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:48,125
Follow me. This way!

1256
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,810
Ooh, he's here.

1257
01:09:49,834 --> 01:09:51,166
Take my hand!

1258
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:52,410
Hurry! Hurry!

1259
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,184
Quickly, in here.

1260
01:09:54,208 --> 01:09:56,500
Do hide. Do hide. Oh!

1261
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,083
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1262
01:10:15,709 --> 01:10:17,750
No! Oh, come on.

1263
01:10:18,917 --> 01:10:21,041
Ah, Ben.

1264
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:23,583
Were you looking for me?

1265
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:24,667
No, no.

1266
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:25,834
Wait.

1267
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,208
Whoa!

1268
01:10:27,792 --> 01:10:29,000
Whoa... Whoa!

1269
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,375
What?

1270
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:35,125
Oh.

1271
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,083
No reason to be afraid.

1272
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:43,583
Now, I know this place
is absolutely dripping

1273
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,750
with the most sorrowful souls,

1274
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:49,000
all searching
for what eluded them in life.

1275
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:51,125
Searching for purpose,

1276
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:53,542
too cowardly to do anything about it.

1277
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:57,667
But you, you have promise.

1278
01:10:57,834 --> 01:11:00,250
You know that life has no meaning.

1279
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:02,542
That we all end up in the dirt.

1280
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:04,750
Boo!

1281
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:10,792
If you're willing to help me,
I can give you what you want.

1282
01:11:10,875 --> 01:11:12,542
No! No!

1283
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,583
The spirit realm
is not welcoming me tonight.

1284
01:11:27,542 --> 01:11:28,750
There's no use in running!

1285
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:33,375
Suffering is for the weak
and I know the way out.

1286
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:38,250
We have a deal to make.

1287
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:41,750
It's quite disappointing, but...

1288
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:45,291
But the real chill starts later.

1289
01:11:45,458 --> 01:11:46,917
That... That's not Ben.

1290
01:11:58,834 --> 01:12:01,333
You can get what you want...

1291
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:06,125
if you're willing.

1292
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:09,375
Ben!

1293
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,000
Ah, it's me, it's me, it's me.

1294
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,417
I'm all right.

1295
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,625
I saw him.

1296
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,792
This was not a regular ghost.

1297
01:12:20,959 --> 01:12:22,875
Gracey was terrified.

1298
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:24,458
I mean, they all were.

1299
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,792
Come on, a ghost who haunts other ghosts?

1300
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:29,208
That's not fair.

1301
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:30,959
Aren't there any rules?

1302
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,375
Did he look human?

1303
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:33,458
Sorta.

1304
01:12:33,542 --> 01:12:35,125
He walked with a cane and a limp,

1305
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:38,917
and he carried his head
inside of a hatbox.

1306
01:12:39,083 --> 01:12:40,583
What part of that is "sorta"?

1307
01:12:41,083 --> 01:12:43,500
Is there anything else
that we can go on

1308
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:46,000
to identify this "Hatbox Ghost"?

1309
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:51,875
I can give you what you want.

1310
01:12:52,458 --> 01:12:54,250
The face in the box, it, um...

1311
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:56,917
He had this grin.

1312
01:12:57,792 --> 01:13:00,542
This grin that's just
burned into my memory.

1313
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,208
What was it like in there?

1314
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:04,959
I mean, for a ghost realm,
there was just so much...

1315
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,625
life.

1316
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:09,458
I mean, it wasn't even
really hard to reverse seance.

1317
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:12,083
No, I feel like I felt it
for a couple minutes,

1318
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:13,750
like I was tripping.

1319
01:13:13,834 --> 01:13:15,101
Like a out-of-body experience.

1320
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:17,834
- It was a little bit of a shake, a tingle.
- Electricity.

1321
01:13:17,917 --> 01:13:20,417
I know, Harriet,
I know that you can do that thing,

1322
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:22,875
but I think I was just feelin' so raw.

1323
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,875
No, no, it's fine.

1324
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:26,792
- I'm limited.
- No, you're not.

1325
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,208
It is what it is.

1326
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:31,375
My family never believed
I had the gift either.

1327
01:13:31,542 --> 01:13:33,166
Do you have any living family?

1328
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,500
Three sisters.
Bullied me every day of my life.

1329
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:39,041
My older sister? She's just terrible.

1330
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:42,917
My middle sister,
she's just an awful person.

1331
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:45,917
But my younger sister...

1332
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:49,083
I actually believe she is the Devil.

1333
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,125
Anyways...

1334
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:54,250
I know I can be
challenging to be around.

1335
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:56,125
No, it's not that, Harriet.

1336
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:57,792
He wants me.

1337
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,917
I think he wants me to be his last soul.

1338
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:07,417
No. Ben, look at me.

1339
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:08,792
You're not alone.

1340
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,959
My... My wife died in a car accident.

1341
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:20,166
What was she like?

1342
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:22,834
She was the best.

1343
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,000
Yeah, she was just herself.

1344
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,208
And, um...

1345
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:31,875
She liked to dance.

1346
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:34,458
<i>She never...
She couldn't dance, but she liked to.</i>

1347
01:14:34,625 --> 01:14:37,834
<i>She also was the world's slowest runner.</i>

1348
01:14:37,917 --> 01:14:40,500
<i>She'd say, "Let's go running,"</i>

1349
01:14:40,667 --> 01:14:42,750
and she was eating a cheesesteak
while she said this.

1350
01:14:42,834 --> 01:14:44,667
Talking about,
"I'm getting my carbo load."

1351
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:50,291
She was the type of person
that just included everyone.

1352
01:14:50,959 --> 01:14:52,375
And, you know, I was...

1353
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:56,166
I was kinda the opposite.
People made me nervous.

1354
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,333
Oh, you...
You have no social skills at all.

1355
01:14:58,917 --> 01:15:00,250
Uh...

1356
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:01,583
It's true.

1357
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,041
And there's, uh...

1358
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:09,333
no way I could have gotten
to where I've gotten without her.

1359
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:16,166
Then one day, she, um...

1360
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:19,917
She decided she was gonna go
get some, uh, tater tots.

1361
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,583
She liked tater tots.

1362
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:23,709
She asked me to go with her.

1363
01:15:23,917 --> 01:15:24,917
And, uh...

1364
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,709
I just... I couldn't do it
'cause I was frustrated.

1365
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:34,000
I had so much work,
and so many things I still had to do.

1366
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,208
So I, um...

1367
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:37,750
So I went off.

1368
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:41,500
And I said,
"Not right now, I'm doing something."

1369
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:45,750
And then, uh, she left.

1370
01:15:46,583 --> 01:15:49,125
Apparently, she stopped off
to get some ice cream,

1371
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:50,667
at a little Baskin Robbins.

1372
01:15:50,834 --> 01:15:52,667
She got into an accident,

1373
01:15:52,834 --> 01:15:54,625
and about 20 minutes later...

1374
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:57,208
she was gone, and...

1375
01:15:57,917 --> 01:16:01,375
So, that's why I put
all my time and energy

1376
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:04,083
dedicated to finishing the camera.

1377
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:07,875
Because I just wanted
to see her one more time.

1378
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,417
She died alone.

1379
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:19,166
And I feel like she didn't know
that I loved her.

1380
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:23,333
No, I'm sure that she knew.

1381
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:25,500
She definitely knew.

1382
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:26,583
My God.

1383
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,417
- What was the cholesterol on that woman?
- Bruce!

1384
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,583
I mean, can you imagine?
Cheesesteak, tater tots.

1385
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:35,000
She stopped off for ice cream.

1386
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,518
- Salt and fat.
- Oh, my God.

1387
01:16:36,542 --> 01:16:37,959
- That's it.
- Bruce.

1388
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:39,667
She was going to the bone orchard!

1389
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,750
Oh, my God!

1390
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:43,667
Thank you, Bruce.

1391
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,792
I needed that.

1392
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,583
Look, I don't know if any of us
are gonna make it out of this alive.

1393
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,625
It certainly seems like Ben's a goner,
but I'll tell ya,

1394
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,875
I wouldn't wanna be going through this
with anyone else.

1395
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,375
Wait, wait, kid,

1396
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:03,333
you said the image of his face

1397
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,417
was burned into your brain.

1398
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:06,709
Yeah.

1399
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:08,291
I have an idea.

1400
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:12,417
My friend was mugged,

1401
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:14,303
and he's going through the trauma
right now,

1402
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,625
but what we would like is a sketch artist,

1403
01:17:16,792 --> 01:17:18,583
while it's still fresh in his mind.

1404
01:17:19,542 --> 01:17:21,792
He was tall.

1405
01:17:21,959 --> 01:17:24,500
And kinda hunched over.

1406
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:26,000
Very thin.

1407
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:30,458
He had hair
that was sticking out of a top hat.

1408
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:33,125
- Top hat?
- Yes. Yeah.

1409
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,518
- So, like, top hat?
- Top hat.

1410
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:37,208
- Yeah.
- Not a bowler or a cowboy hat.

1411
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,685
- Like a opera hat.
- Like a magician, yeah.

1412
01:17:38,709 --> 01:17:39,709
A magician hat!

1413
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,542
You would pull a rabbit
out of it, probably.

1414
01:17:41,709 --> 01:17:42,917
Uh, eyes?

1415
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:44,959
Far apart, close, average?

1416
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:47,041
I think normal. Average.

1417
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,667
Okay, average eyes.

1418
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:50,542
But they were a bit, uh,

1419
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:52,425
sunken into the recesses
of his ocular cavity.

1420
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:53,458
Deep eyes!

1421
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:55,291
- Deep sunken eyes.
- Like a raccoon.

1422
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:57,417
- Beady eyes!
- Like, they were set back.

1423
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,267
- Hmm.
- His eyes were doing that.

1424
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:00,291
And no eyelids.

1425
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:02,458
- So, they're into his skull, no eyelids.
- Yeah.

1426
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:04,000
- What about his nose?
- No nose.

1427
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,417
- He didn't have a...
- No nose!

1428
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,291
Why would he... Why would he have a nose?

1429
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:09,208
Oh. He was smiling.

1430
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:10,834
The man who mugged you was smiling?

1431
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,125
But he didn't have lips.

1432
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:13,625
- It was kind of like...
- Sure.

1433
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:15,834
A perpetual smile of sorts.

1434
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,417
It's kinda like... Yeah, like that.

1435
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,667
- This kind of thing. Okay.
- Exactly, yeah.

1436
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,834
No lips, why not? Why would he have lips?

1437
01:18:22,542 --> 01:18:23,959
Is this the man who mugged you?

1438
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:25,750
- Wow!
- Whoa!

1439
01:18:26,917 --> 01:18:29,208
You just did that just now?
This is amazing!

1440
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:30,491
You know what'd be fun?

1441
01:18:30,917 --> 01:18:32,375
See him with skin.

1442
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:36,500
The police station paid off!

1443
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:38,041
Alistair Crump.

1444
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:40,250
Very bad man. Very bad.

1445
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:45,000
Son of cutthroat real estate tycoon,
<i>Addison Crump.</i>

1446
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:48,208
<i>A cruel father
who kicked Alistair out of the house</i>

1447
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,667
<i>when he was just a boy,</i>

1448
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:53,959
<i>after claiming Alistair cried too much
at his mother's funeral.</i>

1449
01:18:54,041 --> 01:18:56,625
{\an8}<i>Said he needed to make him a tougher man.</i>

1450
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,125
{\an8}<i>His father's high society</i>
<i>turned its back on the boy.</i>

1451
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:05,417
<i>And with no friends and no other family,</i>

1452
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,542
<i>Alistair disappeared.</i>

1453
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,250
<i>Years later, following
his father's mysterious death,</i>

1454
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:15,583
<i>Alistair returned a wealthy tycoon</i>

1455
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,709
<i>who became famous
for throwing lavish parties</i>

1456
01:19:18,875 --> 01:19:21,375
<i>with the very people who'd betrayed him.</i>

1457
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:25,166
<i>Only many of those guests
never made their way out!</i>

1458
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:31,417
<i>Whispers grew that Alistair
was embroiled in a form of dark magic</i>

1459
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,500
<i>that required blood sacrifice
to maintain his wealth and power.</i>

1460
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:38,875
{\an8}<i>No one ever found the bodies,</i>

1461
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:43,750
{\an8}<i>but after years of abuse,</i>
<i>his staff finally rose up against him</i>

1462
01:19:43,834 --> 01:19:45,500
<i>and beheaded Crump!</i>

1463
01:19:46,291 --> 01:19:48,250
<i>Just before the axe fell,</i>

1464
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:53,083
<i>Alistair vowed revenge on all
from beyond the grave.</i>

1465
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:56,417
Crump, a murderer in life.

1466
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:01,291
Now, a murderer in death.

1467
01:20:02,083 --> 01:20:06,250
Fortunately, for us, his old house
was deemed a historical property,

1468
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:07,917
up a few hours north.

1469
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:09,959
And turned into a bed and breakfast.

1470
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,920
So, we go there,
get something of Crump's,

1471
01:20:12,959 --> 01:20:14,476
and we don't have to die.

1472
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,309
- We got his address.
- Let me get my things.

1473
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:17,976
Yeah, I can go 'cause
I know how to handle the item.

1474
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,059
Now, I'll be back...

1475
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:20,142
Say it again! Say it again!

1476
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:21,226
We're gonna get this guy.

1477
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:22,309
- Yes!
- We're closing in,

1478
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:23,559
that's what we're doing. We're closing in.

1479
01:20:23,583 --> 01:20:25,017
Come on! What's up with the printer?

1480
01:20:25,041 --> 01:20:27,667
- Come on, it's gotta go.
- Uh...

1481
01:20:27,792 --> 01:20:28,935
- It's going.
- It's on.

1482
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:30,279
Is anybody else seeing this?

1483
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:31,375
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

1484
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,959
Leaving us already?

1485
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:39,500
Ben, here's the address!

1486
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:43,208
- If you make it out, get to Crump Manor!
- Oh, no!

1487
01:20:43,291 --> 01:20:45,542
Oh, I do love surprises.

1488
01:20:45,959 --> 01:20:49,125
And I've got a great one
coming up for you.

1489
01:20:49,417 --> 01:20:50,417
Now, Travis...

1490
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,417
Whoa!

1491
01:20:52,834 --> 01:20:53,959
Quicksand!

1492
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,583
Travis!

1493
01:20:57,834 --> 01:20:59,208
Oh, my God. Dynamite!

1494
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:01,667
We're trapped, look for a way out!

1495
01:21:04,208 --> 01:21:05,208
Whoa!

1496
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,917
We gotta go, we gotta go now.

1497
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:11,709
Get to the gargoyles, fast.

1498
01:21:11,959 --> 01:21:13,839
Uh, Travis, you gotta grab
one of the gargoyles!

1499
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,500
That's how we get out of here.

1500
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:19,667
That's great, now hold on.

1501
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,959
Okay, okay, okay!

1502
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:25,083
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh!

1503
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,250
Don't look down.

1504
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:28,834
Ben!

1505
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,542
Not today, Satan.

1506
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:33,208
Uh-uh. You better get back, I rebuke you!

1507
01:21:33,291 --> 01:21:35,125
Not today!

1508
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,250
Bruce!

1509
01:21:41,792 --> 01:21:44,000
Oh! Those teeth look really sharp, Ben.

1510
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:48,709
Hey, painting lady,
uh, what do we do now?

1511
01:21:48,792 --> 01:21:50,917
Whatever you're gonna do,
do it fast.

1512
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:52,893
Come on, hurry!

1513
01:21:52,917 --> 01:21:55,417
You might want to give
that ceiling a second look.

1514
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:58,417
Or you could end up like my husband.

1515
01:21:58,583 --> 01:21:59,810
Get us out of here!

1516
01:21:59,834 --> 01:22:00,834
One second, Travis!

1517
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:03,166
Oh! Okay, it's getting closer!

1518
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:05,041
You see that?

1519
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,750
Climb up and you can get out!

1520
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:08,250
Okay, okay.

1521
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:09,667
Hurry!

1522
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,583
I can't get a grip.

1523
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:13,041
Come on, Ben.

1524
01:22:13,208 --> 01:22:14,875
Okay. Okay. I'm trying.

1525
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,667
Yes! Oh, finally.

1526
01:22:26,667 --> 01:22:28,083
Look, look, it's Kent!

1527
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,208
Oh, Kent! Hey!

1528
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,601
I go to my car for five minutes

1529
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:33,101
and then can't get back in the house.

1530
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:34,125
What happened?

1531
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:36,291
That's 'cause Crump
is trying to keep us here.

1532
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,250
Bruce!

1533
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,583
Bruce, get up!

1534
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:42,500
Whoa... Whoa. Okay, okay.

1535
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,583
This is all right.

1536
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,083
Let's see. No.

1537
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:50,166
Calm down.

1538
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,601
- No. Crump.
- Keep your head back.

1539
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:57,625
I'll drive. Don't worry.
We don't have time.

1540
01:22:57,709 --> 01:22:59,267
I'd love to explain to you,
but we don't have time!

1541
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:00,291
Come on, come on.

1542
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:03,458
Come on, get inside.

1543
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:09,101
- Watch out!
- I got it, I got it.

1544
01:23:09,125 --> 01:23:11,208
I'm too young to die!
Just keep driving!

1545
01:23:11,291 --> 01:23:12,731
It's much harder than it looks!

1546
01:23:12,917 --> 01:23:14,000
Drive! Okay.

1547
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,845
- Watch... Oh, my God!
- I got it, I got it.

1548
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:17,495
I don't want to die!

1549
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:19,417
- Just keep driving!
- Okay, okay.

1550
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:21,083
Put the pedal to the metal!

1551
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:24,166
- I'm going as fast as I can go.
- The trees are attacking us!

1552
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,875
Oh, my God!

1553
01:23:25,959 --> 01:23:27,439
Much harder than it looks. Okay.

1554
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:31,709
There we go, there we go.

1555
01:23:35,417 --> 01:23:36,601
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, okay.

1556
01:23:36,625 --> 01:23:38,142
- Watch where you're going.
- Okay! Okay!

1557
01:23:38,166 --> 01:23:39,583
- Wow. Wow.
- What's going on?

1558
01:23:39,667 --> 01:23:41,625
- What's happening? Huh?
- Uh...

1559
01:23:41,709 --> 01:23:43,625
We found him. He is not happy.

1560
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,267
And what about those guys?

1561
01:23:45,291 --> 01:23:48,041
Well, maybe they'll help us
like the ones in the painting.

1562
01:23:52,959 --> 01:23:54,079
Bruce, stay with me.

1563
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:05,476
Not only is this
a lovely bed and breakfast,

1564
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,500
but the owners,

1565
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,542
Pat and Vic, do dinner theater as well.

1566
01:24:08,625 --> 01:24:09,709
Oh, God.

1567
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:20,083
Okay, um, Mr. Ghost?

1568
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:21,166
Hi.

1569
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:25,041
Uh, do you mind waiting in the car
while we go get your mansion back,

1570
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:28,041
so that you may not haunt us for eternity?

1571
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:32,500
Thank you.

1572
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:34,333
Thank you.

1573
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:38,008
There's a tour starting
in five minutes.

1574
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:39,625
Perfect timing.

1575
01:24:39,792 --> 01:24:42,208
Okay, we're getting one item,
then we leave. Got it?

1576
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:43,500
In and out, real quick.

1577
01:24:43,583 --> 01:24:46,458
This tour will take
approximately three hours.

1578
01:24:46,542 --> 01:24:48,667
Bathroom breaks are strictly prohibited.

1579
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:53,166
Sir Alistair Crump wanted the grandest
house in all of the Valley.

1580
01:24:53,375 --> 01:24:56,834
You'll note there's no seating
in the foyer

1581
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,458
as he would have no man or woman seated

1582
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:01,750
when he entered a room.

1583
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:03,000
That cane.

1584
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,417
Did that belong to Alistair Crump,
by chance?

1585
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,875
Uh, no, that is my cane.

1586
01:25:07,959 --> 01:25:11,875
I use it for
deeply personal reasons.

1587
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:14,750
Does anything in this room
belong to Alistair Crump?

1588
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:16,917
Uh, no.

1589
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,250
Well, I don't know why we're here.

1590
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:25,208
And here, if you'll notice,
this chair at the end of the table

1591
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:28,000
is noticeably higher
than the other chairs.

1592
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,875
He had the legs shortened

1593
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,083
and he added pillows to his seat,

1594
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:34,625
as to remain above everyone else.

1595
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:37,458
I mean, this guy was so petty,
you almost got to respect it.

1596
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:39,500
So, are those his actual pillows?

1597
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:40,667
No.

1598
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:46,083
Here is a portrait
of Mr. Crump's third wife, Margaret.

1599
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,667
Margaret was still just his mistress
at the time of this painting.

1600
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,583
And it was through the painting

1601
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:55,041
that his second wife
learned of the affair,

1602
01:25:55,125 --> 01:25:58,083
when he hung it here for her to see.

1603
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,291
That's one way to do it.

1604
01:26:00,083 --> 01:26:02,959
Well, "I do not trust any man who reads

1605
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:06,834
"nor any woman who, dot, dot, dot, reads."

1606
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:08,834
Was it just hard to find quotes or...

1607
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,750
This, um, comb here,
did that belong to Crump?

1608
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:15,208
No, that is a replica.

1609
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,166
Then why is it in a glass box?

1610
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:19,500
Would you like to be the tour guide?

1611
01:26:21,125 --> 01:26:22,125
No.

1612
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:24,333
No.

1613
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,667
<i>Excuse me.</i>

1614
01:26:25,834 --> 01:26:28,166
I'm going to have to shut everything down.

1615
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,458
There's been

1616
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:31,667
a murder.

1617
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:34,750
Alistair Crump has been decapitated.

1618
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:36,333
Was it the butler?

1619
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,500
No.

1620
01:26:37,667 --> 01:26:40,291
The ingenue from out of town?

1621
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:41,417
She was with me.

1622
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:44,500
I'm Vic, your other tour guide.

1623
01:26:44,667 --> 01:26:46,625
And stage and screen veteran.

1624
01:26:47,083 --> 01:26:49,500
There are many more stories like this one,

1625
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:51,291
if you'll follow me into the salon.

1626
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:53,875
Pat and Vic, they're the best!

1627
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,583
- A murder.
- Mm-hmm.

1628
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:58,583
- I bet that head is in our room.
- It wasn't the last time.

1629
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,000
Wait. What did you say?

1630
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:03,625
Oh. Apparently, they found Crump's body,
but not the head.

1631
01:27:03,792 --> 01:27:05,709
And the suspect walked out empty-handed.

1632
01:27:05,792 --> 01:27:07,250
So, people think...

1633
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:10,875
the head is still here.

1634
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:12,625
Mm.

1635
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,083
Thanks, friend.

1636
01:27:18,583 --> 01:27:19,935
- Looks like...
- We gotta find that head.

1637
01:27:19,959 --> 01:27:21,542
- Yeah.
- How are we gonna find it

1638
01:27:21,625 --> 01:27:22,976
if they haven't found it in 150 years?

1639
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,120
There's another way.

1640
01:27:27,083 --> 01:27:28,208
We're not alone.

1641
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,041
All right. Okay.

1642
01:27:34,417 --> 01:27:35,768
<i>We'll strike out hard.</i>

1643
01:27:36,875 --> 01:27:37,935
<i>A rocky patch of... grounds...</i>

1644
01:27:37,959 --> 01:27:38,959
Um...

1645
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,101
<i>known to provide shelter...</i>

1646
01:27:40,125 --> 01:27:41,208
Hello!

1647
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:43,375
I'm realizing I don't know
what your name is.

1648
01:27:43,542 --> 01:27:45,500
Ben, conversational.

1649
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:47,041
Captain?

1650
01:27:50,208 --> 01:27:51,792
How about this?

1651
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:53,959
What do you need?

1652
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:57,291
Maybe you help us, and we'll help you.

1653
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,375
Okay, that's good. That's...

1654
01:28:02,542 --> 01:28:04,375
He's open, he's open.

1655
01:28:04,834 --> 01:28:05,959
Uh... Oh!

1656
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:09,166
Okay.

1657
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,709
All right. Um...

1658
01:28:12,792 --> 01:28:16,333
Write your message in the mirror,
whatever you want us to do.

1659
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,667
{\an8}-The sea! The sea! Yes!
- Done.

1660
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,059
- Yeah, that's, we can.
- The sea. We can do that.

1661
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:29,083
That's very doable.

1662
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:31,375
You help us, we'll take you to the sea.

1663
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:32,709
{\an8}Here.

1664
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:35,375
Okay, what can you tell us about Crump?

1665
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,500
Okay.

1666
01:29:02,083 --> 01:29:04,166
Can you believe
I've barely had lessons?

1667
01:29:06,542 --> 01:29:08,542
No, no. No singing along, please.

1668
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:27,625
Oh, great. A dead end.

1669
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:29,709
Hmm. Wait a minute.

1670
01:29:32,959 --> 01:29:33,959
Whew.

1671
01:29:34,834 --> 01:29:36,125
I can't fit in there.

1672
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:37,750
Yeah, me neither.

1673
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:42,625
Uh... No.

1674
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:43,834
No.

1675
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,458
You want me to go down there?

1676
01:29:45,625 --> 01:29:47,166
Are you kidding me? I'm a child!

1677
01:29:47,333 --> 01:29:48,834
Yes, this is true,

1678
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,250
and you don't have to go down there.

1679
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:52,750
However,

1680
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:55,291
- you gotta go down there.
- You gotta go.

1681
01:30:05,375 --> 01:30:06,542
You all right? You good?

1682
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:08,375
No! This is a tunnel of terrors!

1683
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:09,583
- Oh, no!
- Uh...

1684
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:14,709
Whoa...

1685
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,041
{\an8}Oh, my gosh.

1686
01:30:28,917 --> 01:30:30,750
This is where he hid all the bodies.

1687
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,250
Whoa! Aah!

1688
01:30:52,375 --> 01:30:54,834
- Travis? Hey, hey!
- Travis, are you okay? Shh.

1689
01:30:54,917 --> 01:30:56,834
Travis, are you all right? You good?

1690
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,542
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1691
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,040
Well, I hope everyone's
okay back at the house.

1692
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:10,250
Whoa, whoa. Look.

1693
01:31:12,417 --> 01:31:13,417
What is it?

1694
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:14,875
Tater tots.

1695
01:31:15,041 --> 01:31:16,709
- It's a ghost wink.
- Let me see.

1696
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:18,333
No.

1697
01:31:18,875 --> 01:31:20,917
Those are my jalapeño poppers.

1698
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:22,959
Look a lot like tots to me.

1699
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:24,125
Oh, my God.

1700
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:37,333
Did we make it in time?

1701
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,625
Everything looks normal.

1702
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:41,959
Of course, normal for this place
is terrifying.

1703
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,291
Yeah, listen,
if we're not back in two hours,

1704
01:31:46,458 --> 01:31:48,250
and I never thought I'd say this,

1705
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:49,417
call the police.

1706
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,333
Wait.

1707
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:52,959
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

1708
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:55,750
Travis, you gotta stay
in the car for me, okay?

1709
01:31:55,917 --> 01:31:58,709
But I did so good! I got us the top hat.

1710
01:31:58,875 --> 01:32:00,291
Just let me be a part of this.

1711
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:03,709
Listen, Travis,
it's just too dangerous.

1712
01:32:07,083 --> 01:32:08,417
Fine.

1713
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,083
- I'll try my dad.
- Okay.

1714
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:14,458
Stay here, okay? Give me.

1715
01:32:24,792 --> 01:32:26,083
Let's do this, baby.

1716
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,917
Kent, come on, man. What are you...

1717
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,583
If this comes down to an exorcism,
we're in big trouble.

1718
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:36,583
- Why... Why...
- Because I don't know what I'm doing.

1719
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:38,291
I'm not even a priest!

1720
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:39,959
I work in Halloween supplies.

1721
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:42,625
I just put this on
just to make some extra scratch.

1722
01:32:42,709 --> 01:32:44,768
Yeah, everyone wants to think
their house is haunted,

1723
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:47,750
so I go sprinkle some holy water
and get paid.

1724
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,125
I'm a fraud.

1725
01:32:49,959 --> 01:32:51,166
I'm sorry.

1726
01:32:52,834 --> 01:32:53,834
You...

1727
01:32:57,583 --> 01:33:00,375
Listen, I don't know what you are,
and I don't even really care.

1728
01:33:00,458 --> 01:33:01,875
All I know is that you helped...

1729
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:03,250
You helped me!

1730
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:08,000
Yeah, you helped me see in myself
that I had something that was useful.

1731
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,125
You taught me that.

1732
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:11,601
And whatever is in that house,
whatever it is that we gotta face,

1733
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:13,375
we can't face it without you, all right?

1734
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:15,792
- No.
- Fa... Father Kent.

1735
01:33:15,959 --> 01:33:17,458
Now, let me ask you something.

1736
01:33:18,917 --> 01:33:20,083
You wanna be a hero?

1737
01:33:22,583 --> 01:33:23,667
No.

1738
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:24,750
See? Now...

1739
01:33:24,834 --> 01:33:27,250
You can't use my lines back against me.

1740
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:29,959
So, let's go! Let's do this!

1741
01:33:30,542 --> 01:33:32,333
- Come on, baby.
- I'm gonna need a drink.

1742
01:33:36,417 --> 01:33:37,726
It's almost midnight.

1743
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,417
Yeah, we need Harriet
to do this banishment spell now.

1744
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:44,792
Harriet?

1745
01:33:52,542 --> 01:33:53,625
I'm afraid of...

1746
01:33:55,125 --> 01:33:57,166
Bruce, you gotta stop doing that.

1747
01:33:57,333 --> 01:33:58,333
Where is everybody?

1748
01:33:58,417 --> 01:34:00,959
The house is clear. It's over.

1749
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:06,333
Harriet found some mumbo jumbo
in that book.

1750
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,041
Things got quite hairy,

1751
01:34:09,208 --> 01:34:12,166
but the shared struggle was necessary

1752
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,000
for character growth.

1753
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:16,041
Oh, okay, so where's Harriet and Gabbie?

1754
01:34:16,417 --> 01:34:17,417
Uh...

1755
01:34:19,583 --> 01:34:21,291
General store.

1756
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Taffy.

1757
01:34:23,583 --> 01:34:24,959
- They went to get taffy?
- Yes!

1758
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:27,417
They went... They went shopping! Drink up!

1759
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,875
Actually, I'm good.

1760
01:34:28,959 --> 01:34:30,041
- Oh. Oh.
- Thank you.

1761
01:34:30,125 --> 01:34:31,709
I'm gonna go find them.

1762
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,709
Oh. Uh...

1763
01:34:35,375 --> 01:34:37,000
Ah. And then there were two.

1764
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:39,333
It's happy hour somewhere, right?

1765
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:41,709
"Happy hour."

1766
01:34:41,792 --> 01:34:43,375
What a turn of phrase.

1767
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,875
Happy hour!

1768
01:34:57,458 --> 01:34:58,458
Dad...

1769
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:00,834
I'm scared.

1770
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,250
<i>Is that the hat?</i>

1771
01:35:07,417 --> 01:35:09,667
No, actually, it's just the replica.

1772
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:11,375
Can I see it?

1773
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yeah...

1774
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:16,959
Bruce, are you okay?

1775
01:35:17,041 --> 01:35:18,601
Here's what's gonna happen.

1776
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:20,542
You're gonna give me the hat.

1777
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:23,583
You're gonna walk out of this house

1778
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:25,625
and never come back.

1779
01:35:28,291 --> 01:35:30,184
- I got you. I got you.
- Where's Travis?

1780
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:31,709
- Give me the hat!
- Bruce, no!

1781
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:33,417
Give me that. Give it!

1782
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,000
- Give it!
- No! No!

1783
01:35:38,583 --> 01:35:40,291
- Ooh!
- The Good Book!

1784
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:48,476
I'm gonna get you, Harriet.
And Gabbie, I'll untie you in a second.

1785
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,667
Travis!

1786
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,125
Dang, girl, you fast.

1787
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:23,125
It's a full moon.
Crump has all his powers!

1788
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:24,408
Harriet, start the banishment.

1789
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:25,893
- Okay, okay, okay.
- You got this.

1790
01:36:25,917 --> 01:36:28,208
When hinges creak

1791
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,417
in doorless chambers...

1792
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,643
and strange and...

1793
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:35,667
Thank you
for your assistance, Professor.

1794
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:39,583
Bruce!

1795
01:36:45,542 --> 01:36:48,166
This wretched place is stifling me.

1796
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:50,500
I think it's time for me to go.

1797
01:36:50,583 --> 01:36:52,023
I'm going to get the hat.

1798
01:36:53,166 --> 01:36:54,250
Scratch the hat.

1799
01:36:54,333 --> 01:36:58,792
There are 999 souls that reside here!

1800
01:36:58,959 --> 01:37:00,750
But there's always room

1801
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:02,792
for one more.

1802
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:04,750
And to think,

1803
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:08,000
it could have been you, Ben.

1804
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:12,542
Travis? Where's Travis?

1805
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:14,768
<i>Travis is okay, all right?</i>

1806
01:37:14,792 --> 01:37:16,432
He's at the car, he's talking to his dad.

1807
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,041
What? That's not possible!

1808
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,458
Gabbie, he still talks to his father.

1809
01:37:20,625 --> 01:37:22,000
His father is dead, Ben.

1810
01:37:22,834 --> 01:37:24,208
Just over a year ago.

1811
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:28,917
Surprise!

1812
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:31,917
I wanna see you, too.

1813
01:37:32,083 --> 01:37:33,667
But how?

1814
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:39,333
I have my willing soul.

1815
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:40,542
Oh, my God!

1816
01:37:41,208 --> 01:37:44,458
I hate to be a terrible host and run,

1817
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:47,583
but I have a reunion to get to.

1818
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:49,834
Don't worry, you won't be alone.

1819
01:37:49,917 --> 01:37:52,166
- Oh, good.
- And now he's conjuring up a ghost army.

1820
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,250
Let my friends show you around.

1821
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,500
Toodle-oo.

1822
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:03,083
Travis...

1823
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:06,792
Okay, all we have to do
is get to that hat.

1824
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:08,755
Okay, Harriet, you're gonna
go see Madame Leota.

1825
01:38:08,834 --> 01:38:10,083
Maybe she'll know what to do.

1826
01:38:10,166 --> 01:38:12,500
- Gabbie, you and me will go find Travis.
- Yes.

1827
01:38:12,792 --> 01:38:14,750
Bruce, you're gonna
stay right here, okay?

1828
01:38:14,917 --> 01:38:18,542
You're gonna go grab the hat
as soon as these ghosts leave, okay?

1829
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:19,834
Why would the ghosts leave?

1830
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:22,333
Because you have the most important job
of them all, Kent.

1831
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,542
You're the diversion.

1832
01:38:23,709 --> 01:38:25,351
We're running out of time!

1833
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:26,768
- Come on. Go.
- Come on.

1834
01:38:26,792 --> 01:38:27,875
Kent...

1835
01:38:28,041 --> 01:38:29,333
I have faith in you.

1836
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:33,959
Leota!

1837
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Travis!

1838
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:43,166
He's trying to keep Travis away from us!

1839
01:38:51,667 --> 01:38:52,667
Travis.

1840
01:38:53,333 --> 01:38:54,458
Dad?

1841
01:38:58,458 --> 01:38:59,667
Whoa!

1842
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:01,667
Whoa!

1843
01:39:03,083 --> 01:39:04,709
- Gabbie! Gabbie!
- Ben!

1844
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:09,083
Time to divert.

1845
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,792
You wanna step to me?

1846
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:12,500
'Cause I got an exorcism for you.

1847
01:39:12,667 --> 01:39:14,041
Starting now.

1848
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:16,417
The wicked shall be driven
from this house.

1849
01:39:16,792 --> 01:39:19,291
Madame Leota? Madame Leota.

1850
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:21,333
We need your help.

1851
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,667
I tried to banish him,
but he's just way too strong.

1852
01:39:25,041 --> 01:39:28,250
The only chance we have to defeat him

1853
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:31,041
is combining our might.

1854
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:33,750
You must release me.

1855
01:39:33,917 --> 01:39:35,667
The power of Kent compels you!

1856
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:37,667
<i>Ipso facto. Carpe diem.</i>

1857
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,041
Go, now!

1858
01:39:40,917 --> 01:39:42,166
Just like I thought.

1859
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:44,875
Exorcism went right over your head.
You know why?

1860
01:39:45,041 --> 01:39:47,917
'Cause you're too stupid
to understand Latin!

1861
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,768
Keep going, it's working.

1862
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:53,125
Bunch of ignorant ghosts.

1863
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:56,125
That's right, I said it. Morons.

1864
01:39:58,583 --> 01:40:00,041
I'm gonna die.

1865
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:04,458
Gracey, I need your help!

1866
01:40:04,625 --> 01:40:06,208
You need to help me find Travis.

1867
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:09,750
Hey, Gracey. Yeah.

1868
01:40:09,834 --> 01:40:11,166
Hey, you gotta help me!

1869
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,250
This way.

1870
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:14,959
With the realms blending,
we can find a faster route.

1871
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:16,542
Whoa!

1872
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:20,333
There is a spell in my book.

1873
01:40:20,417 --> 01:40:26,417
But it can only be recited
by someone with a profound gift.

1874
01:40:27,583 --> 01:40:31,917
You may not believe in yourself,
but I believe in you.

1875
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:36,834
Set me free
and I will help you banish him.

1876
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:43,500
Travis? Is that you?

1877
01:40:44,542 --> 01:40:45,917
Dad, I'm here.

1878
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:53,792
No. No. No.

1879
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:55,792
Bruce, hurry!

1880
01:40:56,750 --> 01:40:58,500
I can't buy you much more time!

1881
01:41:00,166 --> 01:41:01,583
Oh, no! No!

1882
01:41:04,709 --> 01:41:06,041
I'll go find the others.

1883
01:41:07,125 --> 01:41:08,792
Ben, good luck.

1884
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:10,583
Thank you, Gracey.

1885
01:41:14,166 --> 01:41:15,166
Travis!

1886
01:41:19,083 --> 01:41:20,834
Whoa... Travis, Travis,

1887
01:41:20,917 --> 01:41:22,637
all, right, I need you
to give me your hand!

1888
01:41:22,667 --> 01:41:24,250
I'm going to see my dad.

1889
01:41:24,542 --> 01:41:26,083
Look, I made a mistake, okay?

1890
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:27,792
I was wrong. Your dad's not here.

1891
01:41:27,959 --> 01:41:30,166
I'm so sorry about that,
but we don't have time, okay?

1892
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,309
Come on, give me your hand.

1893
01:41:31,333 --> 01:41:33,542
No, but I can hear him.

1894
01:41:33,709 --> 01:41:36,250
Travis, who is that man?

1895
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:39,041
Hey, hey, listen, think about it.
Think about it. Think about it.

1896
01:41:39,125 --> 01:41:42,125
Your dad would want you
to be safe and sound with your mom.

1897
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:45,458
- Now, I need you to trust me.
- No, I hate it here!

1898
01:41:45,542 --> 01:41:47,309
I know, but you and your mom
are gonna be somewhere

1899
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:48,518
completely different than this.

1900
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:50,000
I hate it everywhere!

1901
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:53,500
Nowhere feels right without him.

1902
01:41:56,542 --> 01:41:57,750
Listen, Travis,

1903
01:41:57,917 --> 01:42:00,333
I know the pain you feel.
I feel it, too.

1904
01:42:01,041 --> 01:42:03,208
But I need you to trust me
right now, all right?

1905
01:42:03,291 --> 01:42:05,709
You come here, you tell me
all about your misery.

1906
01:42:06,458 --> 01:42:08,267
We'll be miserable together
until there's nothing left.

1907
01:42:08,291 --> 01:42:09,971
Travis, don't you miss me?

1908
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,625
Your dad, he loves you, okay?

1909
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:14,458
Now, he wants to see
and feel you thrive and live!

1910
01:42:14,542 --> 01:42:15,601
Come on, Travis.

1911
01:42:15,625 --> 01:42:16,667
So, come on.

1912
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,750
Come on!

1913
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:19,309
Travis, don't believe him.

1914
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:20,333
He's not your father.

1915
01:42:20,417 --> 01:42:22,917
Hey, don't let him get in your head.
Come on, you can do it.

1916
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,250
We can be
together again! Don't do this!

1917
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:28,333
He feeds on your grief.
You gotta let it go, Travis.

1918
01:42:28,792 --> 01:42:30,291
You gotta let it go, okay?

1919
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:33,458
Okay, all right, you got it,
you got it. You got it.

1920
01:42:33,542 --> 01:42:35,917
Don't. Don't leave me, please.

1921
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:37,959
Come on. All right. Okay.

1922
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:39,709
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1923
01:42:39,875 --> 01:42:41,083
I got you. I got you.

1924
01:42:41,166 --> 01:42:43,166
You're good. You did good.

1925
01:42:43,250 --> 01:42:44,250
- Okay?
- Okay.

1926
01:42:46,125 --> 01:42:47,917
Oh... That's not good.

1927
01:42:50,917 --> 01:42:52,792
Come on, Travis. We got this.

1928
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:55,375
Good luck!
Down there is a way out.

1929
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:56,542
Travis!

1930
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Oh, thank God!

1931
01:42:58,083 --> 01:42:59,403
- Come on!
- We gotta go!

1932
01:42:59,792 --> 01:43:01,875
- Mom!
- Go, go, go, go!

1933
01:43:02,041 --> 01:43:03,500
Go! Run!

1934
01:43:24,792 --> 01:43:26,166
I told you,

1935
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:28,750
all roads lead to me.

1936
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:32,875
And let me make myself clear.

1937
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:38,333
Either I haunt this boy and his mummy
for all eternity,

1938
01:43:38,500 --> 01:43:41,750
or you and I make a deal.

1939
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:44,583
All you have to be

1940
01:43:45,709 --> 01:43:46,750
is willing.

1941
01:43:47,792 --> 01:43:49,375
- No, no. No. No, no.
- Ben.

1942
01:43:49,458 --> 01:43:52,792
- Don't listen to him.
- I won't let him hurt Travis or you.

1943
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:55,041
Don't do this, Ben, please.

1944
01:43:57,917 --> 01:43:59,375
- Don't do it!
- Ben, no!

1945
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:13,667
Enough. That's it.

1946
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:16,583
And look at yourselves.

1947
01:44:17,166 --> 01:44:19,375
Is this really how you want
to spend eternity?

1948
01:44:19,917 --> 01:44:21,542
- Chasing people?
- Uh-huh.

1949
01:44:21,625 --> 01:44:22,665
Well, you know what?

1950
01:44:22,709 --> 01:44:24,375
You're not that scary, you're really not.

1951
01:44:24,542 --> 01:44:26,709
And... Well, you're pretty terrifying.

1952
01:44:27,291 --> 01:44:29,500
Can you turn around,
just while I finish this rant?

1953
01:44:29,709 --> 01:44:31,500
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

1954
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:38,333
Excellent choice, Ben.

1955
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:42,250
They could never help
what's broken inside of you.

1956
01:44:43,166 --> 01:44:44,542
<i>Crump is using you.</i>

1957
01:44:44,709 --> 01:44:47,250
He's using you to do his own dirty work,
and for what?

1958
01:44:47,583 --> 01:44:50,125
To remain trapped in this house forever?

1959
01:44:50,750 --> 01:44:52,834
And believe me,
I know a con when I see one.

1960
01:44:53,375 --> 01:44:55,625
In fact, this was all a con.

1961
01:44:55,792 --> 01:44:58,166
Yeah, this whole chase
was just a diversion.

1962
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:01,000
<i>While you were distracted,
we've been getting the hat.</i>

1963
01:45:01,166 --> 01:45:03,917
<i>So maybe today is the day you risk it all</i>

1964
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,250
<i>and join the winning team.</i>

1965
01:45:06,125 --> 01:45:09,542
The day you finally rise up as one

1966
01:45:09,709 --> 01:45:13,041
and ask yourself,
are you ready to be a hero?

1967
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:18,834
Oh, my God.

1968
01:45:20,458 --> 01:45:21,542
I have your word,

1969
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:24,142
you're gonna leave them alone
and you're never gonna haunt them again?

1970
01:45:24,166 --> 01:45:27,250
Your soul is the last I'll ever need.

1971
01:45:29,041 --> 01:45:30,250
You know what to do.

1972
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:32,375
You can save them.

1973
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,583
Ben! You have friends here!

1974
01:45:37,083 --> 01:45:40,834
From the moment you stepped foot
into this house,

1975
01:45:41,166 --> 01:45:43,875
<i>I could almost taste your grief.</i>

1976
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:46,291
I know what you've been longing for.

1977
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:47,458
Don't listen to him.

1978
01:45:47,959 --> 01:45:48,959
Say it!

1979
01:45:50,417 --> 01:45:51,583
I'm willing!

1980
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:53,291
Take my hand

1981
01:45:53,458 --> 01:45:56,750
and you will be with your beloved Alyssa.

1982
01:45:56,917 --> 01:45:58,542
Because in this realm,

1983
01:45:58,709 --> 01:46:00,750
you have no one.

1984
01:46:00,834 --> 01:46:02,000
Huh?

1985
01:46:04,875 --> 01:46:05,959
Harriet?

1986
01:46:06,041 --> 01:46:07,417
It's too late.

1987
01:46:08,834 --> 01:46:11,125
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Crump.

1988
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,542
You imprisoned me.

1989
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:19,000
Now it's time to return the favor.

1990
01:46:19,625 --> 01:46:20,625
I set her free.

1991
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:22,000
I did that.

1992
01:46:22,375 --> 01:46:23,500
Pathetic.

1993
01:46:23,667 --> 01:46:25,834
See to them.

1994
01:46:30,458 --> 01:46:32,083
They'll have to come through me first.

1995
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:34,834
And by "me," she means "we"!

1996
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:37,083
Whoo-hoo!

1997
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:40,542
You've all
betrayed me for the last time.

1998
01:46:40,875 --> 01:46:42,333
You'll regret that.

1999
01:46:44,834 --> 01:46:46,959
- I got the hat!
- Bruce!

2000
01:46:48,125 --> 01:46:49,291
Stop him!

2001
01:46:49,458 --> 01:46:50,518
Bring it to us.

2002
01:46:50,542 --> 01:46:53,083
- We must banish him now!
- Yeah.

2003
01:46:53,166 --> 01:46:55,083
I'm done with you, old man.

2004
01:46:55,166 --> 01:46:56,166
Destroy them!

2005
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:57,625
- Bruce!
- Bruce!

2006
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:04,625
We still need a piece of the item.

2007
01:47:04,792 --> 01:47:05,834
I got it. I can help.

2008
01:47:05,917 --> 01:47:07,667
No, no, no, Travis!

2009
01:47:08,417 --> 01:47:09,417
Get... Whoa!

2010
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,875
- I'm coming, Bruce!
- Help Travis!

2011
01:47:12,959 --> 01:47:14,059
- Over here!
- This way!

2012
01:47:14,083 --> 01:47:15,500
I'm coming!

2013
01:47:15,583 --> 01:47:17,875
Enough. I'll have to do this myself.

2014
01:47:19,375 --> 01:47:21,375
Wait, wait! You're right.

2015
01:47:21,458 --> 01:47:24,834
You're absolutely right.
About me, about my grief.

2016
01:47:27,417 --> 01:47:28,417
Take the hat.

2017
01:47:29,291 --> 01:47:30,291
These people...

2018
01:47:30,458 --> 01:47:32,250
You cannot escape.

2019
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:34,875
They can't save me from my grief.

2020
01:47:36,834 --> 01:47:37,959
I'm coming!

2021
01:47:40,959 --> 01:47:41,959
Got it!

2022
01:47:42,041 --> 01:47:43,351
Harriet, you have the power.

2023
01:47:43,375 --> 01:47:44,875
Finish him!

2024
01:47:49,208 --> 01:47:50,667
But they can save me from you.

2025
01:47:50,834 --> 01:47:53,625
When hinges creak in doorless chambers...

2026
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:58,875
where the air is deathly still,

2027
01:48:00,125 --> 01:48:01,875
these souls will not be displaced.

2028
01:48:03,917 --> 01:48:07,250
Return them to their final resting place!

2029
01:48:07,333 --> 01:48:08,750
Ben. No.

2030
01:48:09,291 --> 01:48:10,709
Yes! Say it again!

2031
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:12,250
Return!

2032
01:48:14,083 --> 01:48:17,792
I will torment your friends
for all eternity.

2033
01:48:17,959 --> 01:48:19,041
Say it again!

2034
01:48:19,208 --> 01:48:20,917
Return!

2035
01:48:22,792 --> 01:48:24,250
Return!

2036
01:48:28,208 --> 01:48:29,208
Ben!

2037
01:48:29,375 --> 01:48:31,542
Come with me to see your wife.

2038
01:48:31,709 --> 01:48:35,208
This is your last chance
to tell Alyssa that you love her.

2039
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:52,667
She... She knows.

2040
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:55,375
Ben.

2041
01:48:55,542 --> 01:48:56,792
No.

2042
01:48:56,959 --> 01:48:58,041
No!

2043
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:09,250
Yes!

2044
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:12,959
We did it! Come on.
Come here, you scary son of a gun.

2045
01:49:23,333 --> 01:49:25,083
I think you got your house back now.

2046
01:49:34,959 --> 01:49:36,542
Ben!

2047
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:40,458
- You're okay!
- Wow, you did so good.

2048
01:49:41,625 --> 01:49:42,709
Wow.

2049
01:49:42,875 --> 01:49:44,041
Thank you.

2050
01:49:48,208 --> 01:49:49,328
Get in here.

2051
01:49:49,375 --> 01:49:50,559
You were so brave.
So proud of you.

2052
01:49:50,583 --> 01:49:51,643
Ben, just like
in the history books.

2053
01:49:51,667 --> 01:49:53,227
Aw. We couldn't do it without you.

2054
01:49:53,458 --> 01:49:54,875
Come on.

2055
01:49:55,709 --> 01:49:57,041
And now you're free!

2056
01:49:57,208 --> 01:49:59,208
Free to return to the ghost realm.

2057
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,500
Go on!

2058
01:50:01,375 --> 01:50:02,667
Disperse!

2059
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:06,834
Okay, look,
we gotta talk about boundaries.

2060
01:50:08,625 --> 01:50:12,709
I sense that many of these ghosts
don't want to move on.

2061
01:50:13,792 --> 01:50:14,792
What about you?

2062
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:17,125
Well, the spell will fade soon.

2063
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:19,208
I will return to my crystal ball.

2064
01:50:20,375 --> 01:50:22,750
No, it's actually quite spacious inside.

2065
01:50:25,041 --> 01:50:26,917
This house is where I belong.

2066
01:50:27,750 --> 01:50:28,750
Mm.

2067
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:31,250
Hmm...

2068
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:49,917
Yeah, these ghosts
definitely don't wanna leave this house.

2069
01:50:51,834 --> 01:50:54,250
- They can have it.
- Well, you know,

2070
01:50:54,417 --> 01:50:57,041
somebody's gonna have to
watch after them, right?

2071
01:50:58,875 --> 01:50:59,875
Boom.

2072
01:51:11,959 --> 01:51:12,959
<i>Yeah, Phil</i>

2073
01:51:13,291 --> 01:51:14,667
It... It's all right.

2074
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:15,935
Go on, go on, don't be scared.

2075
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:16,959
Go ahead.

2076
01:51:19,041 --> 01:51:20,875
<i>Everybody</i>

2077
01:51:20,959 --> 01:51:23,125
<i>- Everybody
- Needs somebody</i>

2078
01:51:23,208 --> 01:51:25,250
<i>- Needs somebody
- Everybody</i>

2079
01:51:25,333 --> 01:51:26,518
<i>Everybody</i>

2080
01:51:26,542 --> 01:51:28,125
<i>Needs somebody</i>

2081
01:51:28,208 --> 01:51:29,375
<i>Do whatcha wanna</i>

2082
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:30,458
<i>Do whatcha wanna</i>

2083
01:51:30,542 --> 01:51:31,542
Whoa!

2084
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:33,250
Ohh! Ahhh!

2085
01:51:34,375 --> 01:51:35,375
Oh!

2086
01:51:42,166 --> 01:51:43,792
- Hey.
- Hey.

2087
01:51:44,834 --> 01:51:47,208
Make sure you take care
of her things, okay?

2088
01:51:47,375 --> 01:51:52,375
Well, it's gonna make some lucky lady
at my parish very happy.

2089
01:51:52,542 --> 01:51:54,041
You don't have a parish.

2090
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:55,667
I still like to give.

2091
01:51:56,542 --> 01:51:58,000
You okay?

2092
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,333
I'm okay.

2093
01:52:01,291 --> 01:52:03,083
Well, bop 'til you drop.

2094
01:52:04,667 --> 01:52:06,083
See you tonight.

2095
01:52:07,542 --> 01:52:08,542
Hey.

2096
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:11,208
Hey, there.

2097
01:52:13,083 --> 01:52:14,750
How you doing?

2098
01:52:16,542 --> 01:52:18,917
Oh, so pretty.

2099
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:22,542
What's this you got here?

2100
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:25,333
What's your name?

2101
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:00,333
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi!

2102
01:53:00,500 --> 01:53:02,417
The lecture went on a little long...

2103
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:03,834
- Aw!
- But there you are.

2104
01:53:03,917 --> 01:53:06,041
- Mm.
- I saw you got the job.

2105
01:53:06,208 --> 01:53:09,500
You are looking at the newest addition
to New Orleans General.

2106
01:53:09,583 --> 01:53:10,583
Yes!

2107
01:53:10,750 --> 01:53:12,500
So, that means you guys
are stayin', right?

2108
01:53:12,959 --> 01:53:16,875
Uh, I could have told you that
last week, honey.

2109
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:20,291
Why have a medium as a friend
if you don't ask?

2110
01:53:20,458 --> 01:53:21,625
- Facts.
- Ben.

2111
01:53:22,291 --> 01:53:23,375
Hey!

2112
01:53:25,291 --> 01:53:26,291
Hey.

2113
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:28,458
- Happy Halloween.
- Happy Halloween.

2114
01:53:28,542 --> 01:53:29,982
Tell him.

2115
01:53:30,041 --> 01:53:31,834
Tell him. It's good news.

2116
01:53:32,417 --> 01:53:34,417
I was voted as Vice President of my class.

2117
01:53:34,583 --> 01:53:35,709
What?

2118
01:53:35,875 --> 01:53:37,917
What? That's amazing!

2119
01:53:38,083 --> 01:53:40,000
And guess who got ordained as a minister?

2120
01:53:40,083 --> 01:53:41,976
Just in case you got any friends
who wanna get married.

2121
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,291
Okay.

2122
01:53:43,375 --> 01:53:45,792
Come on, you two.
The chili's getting cold.

2123
01:53:45,875 --> 01:53:47,115
- Okay, all right!
- Okay.

2124
01:53:47,166 --> 01:53:48,333
Well, can I come in?

2125
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:51,709
Well, Ben, I should warn you
before you step inside,

2126
01:53:52,917 --> 01:53:55,208
this could change
the course of your entire life.

2127
01:53:55,792 --> 01:53:56,875
Mm.

2128
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,291
Well, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

2129
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:03,583
All right, then welcome.

2130
01:54:03,667 --> 01:54:04,667
All right.

2131
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:37,125
Nice!

2132
01:54:37,375 --> 01:54:38,417
Cheers.

2133
01:54:38,875 --> 01:54:40,250
To the afterlife!

2134
01:54:41,583 --> 01:54:43,542
- To the afterlife.
- To life!

2135
