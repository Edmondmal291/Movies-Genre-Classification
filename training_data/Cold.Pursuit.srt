you go to The Eskimo.

Well, that works for me.

Who knew White Bull
had that kind of coin?

642
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,394
White Bull's an Indian.
Indians don't farm out their kills.

643
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,270
So, if it wasn't White Bull,
then who the hell was it?

644
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:22,589
That's what I'm selling.

645
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,315
- Well, how much?
- Ninety grand.

646

You gotta love the symmetry, there.

647

Guy's name is Coxman.

659
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,760
Coxman.

660
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,832
There was a Coxman
on Dad's payroll, right?

661
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,753
What was his name? He called
himself, uh, Wing... Ding...

662

Ringworm... Wing... Ding...

663

Wingman wants me dead?
Why?

666
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,190
The why of it ain't my business
so I don't aks.

667
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,595
- Ask.
- I think our business here is done.

668
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,880
So it is.

669
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,515
Hey, can I ask two questions?
If I may.

670

One pro to another.

671

Shoot.

672

Come again?

680
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,670
You made a deal to kill me for 90 grand
and you didn't honor that deal.

681
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,877
It's because I'm honoring this one.

682
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,680
Yeah.

683

Hey Bone, what is it
you used to say about him?

- No, none taken.

Let me ask you a question.

not gonna like that.

how we might set things right?
