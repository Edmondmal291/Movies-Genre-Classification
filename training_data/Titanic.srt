1
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,577
13 meters. You should see it.

2
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,634
Okay, take her up and over the bow rail.

3
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,431
 <i>Mir 2, we're going over the bow.</i> 
 <i>Stay with us.</i> 

4
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,426
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

5
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,430
Seeing her coming out of the
darkness like a ghost ship

6
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,515
still gets me every time.

7
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,937
To see the sad ruin
of the great ship sitting here

8
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:09,899
where she landed at 2:30 in the morning

9
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,817
of April 15, 1912

10
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,778
after her long fall

11
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,239
from the world above.

12
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,491
You are so full of shit, boss.

13
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,692
Dive 6. Here we are again
on the deck of <i>Titanic.</i>

14
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,988
Two and a half miles down. 3,821 meters.

15
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:03,327
The pressure outside is
three and a half tons per square inch.

16
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,829
These windows are nine inches thick.

17
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,750
If they go, it's <i>sayonara</i>
in two microseconds.

18
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,711
All right, enough of that bullshit.

19
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:30,062
Just put her down on the roof of
the officers' quarters like yesterday.

20
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:36,026
 <i>Mir 2, we're landing right over the</i> 
 <i>Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch?</i> 

21
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,780
Yeah, Brock. Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

22
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,707
-All right, tether out.
-Tether out.

23
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,585
 <i>Okay, Brock, we're dropping</i> 
 <i>down along the hull.</i> 

24
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:00,217
Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down and go
into the first class gangway door.

25
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,177
I want you guys working the D deck

26
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,763
 <i>reception area and the dining saloon.</i> 

27
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:06,557
 <i>Copy that.</i> 

28
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,941
-Tether out. Okay, now left. Left, left.
-Okay, coming left.

29
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,744
 <i>Snoop Dog is on the move.</i> 

30
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,787
 <i>We're headed down the stairwell.</i> 

31
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,375
Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.

32
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,211
-Okay, A deck.
-Give me some rope, Captain.

33
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,047
B deck. Get in there. Get in there.

34
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,712
Watch the door frame.

35
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,506
-Watch it, watch it.
-I see it. I got it.

36
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,971
-We good? Bring her down.
-We're good. Just chill, boss.

37
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,613
{\an8}Okay, make your turn.

38
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,491
{\an8}-Cable out, Captain.
-Make your turn. Watch the wall.

39
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,910
Yeah Brock, we're at the piano. You copy?

40
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,037
 <i>Okay, copy that.</i> 

41
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,630
Okay, right there. Right there.

42
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,423
Okay, that's it, that's it.
That's the bedroom door.

43
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,092
I see it. I see it.

44
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,185
We're in!

45
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,979
We're in, baby. We're there.

46
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,649
That's Hockley's bed.

47
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,901
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

48
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,535
Oops. Somebody left the water running.

49
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,163
Hold it. Hold it just a second.
Go back to the right.

50
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,088
That wardrobe door. Get closer.

51
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,840
You smelling something, boss?

52
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,260
-I want to see what's under it.
-Give me my hands, man.

53
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,267
All right.

54
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,854
-Take it easy. It might come apart.
-Okay.

55
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,525
Go, go, go. Flip it over.
Flip it over. Go.

56
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,402
Turn her over. Keep going.

57
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,862
Go, go, go.

58
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,280
Okay, drop it.

59
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,626
Oh, baby, baby. Are you seeing this, boss?

60
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,547
It's payday, boys.

61
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,023
Cha-ching!

62
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,734
-We did it, Bobby.
-We brought it back, Baby.

63
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:49,071
Oh, yeah! Who's the best?
Who's the best, baby?

64
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,406
Say it. Say it. Say it.

65
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,408
You are, Lewis.

66
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:56,995
-Bobby, my cigar.
-Right here.

67
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,922
Okay, crack her open.

68
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,036
Shit.

69
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,790
No diamond.

70
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,546
{\an8}You know, boss, this same thing happened
to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

71
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,968
Turn the camera off.

72
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,929
Brock, the partners would like
to know how it's going.

73
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:01,310
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi. Look, I it wasn't
in the safe. But hey, hey...

74
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,522
Don't worry about it. There's still
plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes.

75
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,733
The floor debris in the suite,
the mother's room,

76
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,234
the purser's safe on C deck.

77
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,402
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

78
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,237
A dozen other places. Guys, look,

79
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:15,657
you're just going to have to
trust my instincts. I know we're close.

80
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,076
We've just got to go through a little
process of elimination.

81
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,163
Hang on a second.

82
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,168
-Let me see that.
-We may have something here, guys.

83
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,590
Where's the photograph of the necklace?

84
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,674
We'll call you right back.

85
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,521
I'll be goddamned.

86
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,944
 <i>Treasure hunter Brock Lovett</i> 
 <i>is best known for finding Spanish gold...</i>

Brock!

112
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,437
There's a satellite call for you.

113
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,065
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water?

114
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,776
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.

115
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,863
This better be good.

116
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,866
Now, you gotta speak up.
She's kind of old.

117
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,284
Great.

118
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,705
This is Brock Lovett.
How can I help you, Mrs...

119
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,790
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

120
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:29,875
Mrs. Calvert.

121
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,045
I was just wondering if you had found

122
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,131
the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr. Lovett.

123
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,302
Told you you wanted to take the call.

124
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:45,724
All right, you have my attention, Rose.

125
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,059
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?

126
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,813
Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.

127
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:12,417
She's a goddamn liar!
Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.

128
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,505
God only knows why.
Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.

129
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,673
They're inbound!

130
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:27,599
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
<i>Titanic</i> when she was 17, right?

131
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,808
That's right.

132
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,353
If she had lived,
she'd be over 100 by now.

133
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,855
101 next month.

134
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,025
Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.

135
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,611
Look, I've already done
the background on this woman

136
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:43,532
all the way back to the '20s,
when she was working as an actress.

137
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,701
An actress.
There's your first clue, Sherlock.

138
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:51,289
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

139
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,876
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

140
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,380
Now Calvert's dead and,
from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.

141
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,132
And everybody who knows about
the diamond is supposed to be dead

142
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,134
or on this boat, but she knows.

143
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,150
Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?

144
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,527
Hurry up, give him a hand.

145
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,990
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the <i>Keldysh.</i>

146
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,077
Okay, let's get her inside there.

147
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:30,579
Hi, Miss Calvert.

148
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,831
-Hi.
-Welcome to the <i>Keldysh.</i>

149
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,916
Thanks.

150
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,460
Hey!

151
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,178
-Yes?
-Are your staterooms all right?

152
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,598
Oh, yes. Very nice.

153
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,641
Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy?

154
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,393
She takes care of me.

155
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,521
We met just a few minutes ago.

156
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,689
Remember, Nana? Up on deck?

157
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,065
Oh, yes.

158
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,693
There. That's nice.

159
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,529
Have to have my pictures when I travel.

160
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,780
Can I get you anything?

161
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,115
Is there anything you'd like?

162
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,868
Yes.

163
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,704
I would like to see my drawing.

164
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:31,264
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone that was
called the Blue Diamond of the Crown

165
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,017
which disappeared in 1792

166
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:38,188
about the same time old Louis lost
everything from the neck up.

167
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,233
The theory goes that the crown diamond
was chopped, too.

168
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,946
Recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as the Heart of the Ocean.

169
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,824
Today it would be worth
more than the Hope diamond.

170
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,243
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

171
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,579
I only wore it this once.

172
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,165
You actually think this is you, Nana?

173
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,292
It is me, dear.

174
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,294
Wasn't I a dish?

175
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,007
I tracked it down
through insurance records.

176
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,928
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

177
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,765
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

178
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,685
I should imagine someone named Hockley.

179
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,728
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

180
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,189
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

181
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,694
The claim was for a diamond necklace
his son Caledon, bought his fiancée.

182
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,112
You.

183
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,447
A week before he sailed on <i>Titanic.</i>

184
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,784
And it was filed right after the sinking.

185
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,705
So the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

186
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,290
You see the date?

187
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,794
April 14, 1912.

188
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,964
Which means if your grandmother
is who she says she is

189
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,758
she was wearing the diamond
the day the <i>Titanic </i>sank.

190
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,262
And that makes you my new best friend.

191
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,807
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

192
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,687
This was mine.

193
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,982
How extraordinary.

194
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,069
And it looks the same as it
did the last time I saw it.

195
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,327
The reflection has changed a bit.

196
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,513
Are you ready to go back to <i>Titanic?</i>

197
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,268
Okay, here we go.

198
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,563
She hits the berg on
the starboard side, right?

199
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,774
She kind of bumps along
punching holes like Morse Code,

200
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,610
"Dit, dit, dit," along the side
below the water line.

201
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,654
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

202
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,740
Now, as the water level rises

203
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,742
it spills over the watertight bulkheads

204
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,536
which, unfortunately, don't go
any higher than E deck.

205
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:03,208
So now as the bow goes down
the stern rises up, slow at first,

206
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,001
then faster and faster

207
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,171
until finally, she's got her whole
ass sticking up in the air.

208
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,297
And that's a big ass.

209
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,425
We're talking 20, 30,000 tons. Okay?

210
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,719
And the hull's not designed
to deal with that pressure.

211
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,513
So, what happens?

212
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,681
She splits, right down to the keel.

213
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:21,226
And the stern falls back level.

214
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,396
Then as the bow sinks,
it pulls the stern vertical

215
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,649
and then finally detaches.

216
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:31,736
Now the stern section just kind of bobs
there like a cork for a couple of minutes,

217
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,156
floods, and finally goes under
about 2:20 a.m.

218
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,575
Two hours and forty minutes
after the collision.

219
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:43,373
The bow section planes away,
landing about a half a mile away

220
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,416
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

221
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,089
Pretty cool, huh?

222
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:55,927
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.

223
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,098
Of course, the experience of it was

224
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:02,600
somewhat different.

225
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,103
Will you share it with us?

226
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,075
I'm taking her to rest.

227
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,160
No.

228
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,494
Come on, Nana.

229
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,913
No!

230
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,668
Give me the tape recorder.

231
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,839
Tell us, Rose.

232
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,010
It's been 84 years...

233
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,095
It's okay. Just try to remember anything,

234
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,722
anything at all.

235
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,684
Do you want to hear this
or not, Mr. Lovett?

236
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,691
It's been 84 years,

237
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,529
and I can still smell the fresh paint.

238
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,159
The china had never been used.

239
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,537
The sheets had never been slept in.

240
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,126
 <i>Titanic </i>was called the ship of dreams.

241
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:54,796
And it was.

242
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,757
It really was.

243
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:31,499
{\an8}All third-class passengers
with a forward berth,

244
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,127
{\an8}this way please! This queue!

245
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,045
It's a big boat, huh?

246
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,172
Daddy, it's a ship.

247
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,257
You're right.

248
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,497
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

249
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,083
It doesn't look any bigger
than the <i>Mauretania.</i>

250
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,002
You can be blasé about some things, Rose,

251
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,920
but not about <i>Titanic.</i>

252
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,881
It's over 100 feet longer than <i>Mauretania</i>

253
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,507
and far more luxurious.

254
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,802
Your daughter is far too
difficult to impress, Ruth.

255
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,056
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

256
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,182
It is unsinkable.

257
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,683
God Himself could not sink this ship...

258
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,809
What?

259
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,394
You have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

260
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,729
It's round that way, sir.

261
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,481
I put my faith in you good sir.

262
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:37,690
Now kindly see my man.

263
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,067
Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir.

264
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,193
If I can do anything at all...

265
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,611
Yes, right.

266
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,990
All the trunks from that car there.
12 from here.

267
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:50,953
And the safe, to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

268
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,125
Ladies, we better hurry.

269
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,460
Come along.

270
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,007
-My coat?
-I have it, miss.

271
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,598
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

272
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,273
-Welcome aboard, ma'am.
-Welcome to <i>Titanic.</i>

273
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,568
 <i>It was the ship of dreams</i> 

274
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,028
 <i>to everyone else.</i> 

275
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,323
 <i>To me, it was a slave ship</i> 

276
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,827
 <i>taking me back to America in chains.</i> 

277
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:35,832
 <i>Outwardly, I was everything</i> 
 <i>a well brought up girl should be.</i> 

278
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:38,668
 <i>Inside, I was screaming.</i> 

279
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,435
Jack, you are <i>pazzo.</i>

280
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,396
You bet everything we have.

281
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,691
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

282
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,820
You moron. I can't believe
you bet our tickets.

283
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,158
Sven?

284
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,223
All right, moment of truth.

285
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,726
Someone's life is about to change.

286
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,102
Fabrizio?

287
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,734
Olaf?

288
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,903
Nothing.

289
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,404
Sven?

290
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,910
Two pair.

291
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,162
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.

292
00:24:58,331 --> 00:24:59,373
I'm sorry,

293
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,627
you're not gonna see your mom again
for a long time

294
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,503
'cause we're going to America.

295
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:05,671
Full house, boys!

296
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:21,312
Come on.

297
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,773
I'm going home!

298
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,194
I'm going home.

299
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,654
I go to America!

300
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,280
No, mate.

301
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,532
 <i>Titanic </i>go to America,

302
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,117
in five minutes.

303
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:36,661
Shit. Fabri. Come on.

304
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,787
Come on, here. Here.

305
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,999
We're riding in high style now!

306
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,543
We're a couple of regular swells.

307
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,421
We're practically goddamn royalty,
<i>ragazzo mio.</i>

308
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,632
You see? Is my <i>destino.</i>

309
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:53,010
Like I told you,
I go to America to be millionaire.

310
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,390
You are <i>pazzo.</i>

311
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,225
Maybe, but I've got the tickets.

312
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,603
Come on, I thought you were fast.

313
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,231
Whoa. Wait! Wait!

314
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,732
Hey, wait!

315
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,276
We're passengers!

316
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,780
Have you been through
the inspection queue?

317
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:15,074
Of course. Anyway, we don't have any lice.

318
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,118
We're Americans. Both of us.

319
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,245
Right. Come aboard.

320
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,084
We're the luckiest sons
of bitches in the world.

321
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,168
You know that?

322
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,429
Good-bye!

323
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,517
You know somebody?

324
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,102
Of course not. That's not the point.

325
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,729
Good-bye! I'll miss you!

326
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,147
Good-bye!

327
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,316
I will never forget you!

328
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,532
Come with me, darling. Let's go.

329
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,411
G-60.

330
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,081
G-60. G-60.

331
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,499
Excuse me, ma'am.

332
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,751
G-60.

333
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,754
Right here.

334
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,339
Hey, how you doing?

335
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,466
Jack. Nice to meet you.

336
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:57,259
Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.

337
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:58,719
How you doing?

338
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,764
Who says you get top bunk, huh?

339
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,893
Where's Sven?

340
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,522
This is your private promenade deck, sir.

341
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,899
Will you be requiring anything?

342
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:13,442
Excuse me.

343
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,528
-This one?
-No.

344
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:18,030
It had a lot of faces on it.

345
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,949
This is the one.

346
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,452
Would you like all of them out, miss?

347
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,956
Yes. We need a little color in this room.

348
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,002
Put it in there. In the wardrobe.

349
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:35,214
God, not those finger paintings again.

350
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,882
They certainly were a waste of money.

351
00:28:37,133 --> 00:28:38,968
The difference between
Cal's taste in art and mine

352
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,636
is that I have some.

353
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,720
They're fascinating.

354
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,224
Like being inside a dream or something.

355
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,809
There's truth but no logic.

356
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,937
-What's the artist's name?
-Something Picasso.

357
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,355
Something Picasso.

358
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,190
He won't amount to a thing.

359
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,525
He won't, trust me.

360
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:57,069
-Let's put the Degas in the bedroom.
-At least they were cheap.

361
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,655
Put it in the wardrobe.

362
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:09,498
 <i>At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard</i> 
 <i>named Margaret Brown.</i> 

363
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,500
 <i>We all called her Molly.</i> 

364
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,004
 <i>History would call her</i> 
 <i>the Unsinkable Molly Brown.</i> 

365
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,465
Well, I wasn't about to
wait all day for you, sonny.

366
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,717
Here, if you think you can manage.

367
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,345
 <i>Her husband had struck gold</i> 
 <i>someplace out west.</i> 

368
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,474
 <i>And she was what Mother</i> 
 <i>called "new money."</i> 

369
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,976
 <i>By the next afternoon,</i> 

370
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,812
 <i>we were steaming west</i> 
 <i>from the coast of Ireland</i> 

371
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:36,150
 <i>with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.</i> 

372
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,533
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.

373
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,660
Let's stretch her legs.

374
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,120
Yes, sir.

375
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,415
All ahead full, Mr. Moody.

376
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,042
Very good, sir.

377
00:29:58,672 --> 00:29:59,798
All ahead full.

378
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:01,926
{\an8}All ahead full!

379
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:03,761
Come on lads, step lively!

380
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,615
All right! Let's stoke her right up!

381
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,908
We go full ahead!

382
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,369
Come on, put your backs into it!

383
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,967
21 knots, sir.

384
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,893
Hey, look, look, look!

385
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,481
See it?

386
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,820
There's another one! See him?

387
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,999
Look at that one! Look at him jump!

388
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,111
I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

389
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,613
Very small, of course.

390
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,036
I'm the king of the world!

391
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,210
 <i>She is the largest moving object</i> 
 <i>ever made by the hand of man</i> 

392
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,337
in all history.

393
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,798
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here

394
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,758
designed her from the keel plates up.

395
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:34,221
I may have knocked her together,
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.

396
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,057
He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale

397
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,309
and so luxurious in its appointments

398
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,562
that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

399
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,188
And here she is.

400
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:46,734
-Willed into solid reality.
-Hear, hear.

401
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,445
I'll have the salmon.

402
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:54,950
You know I don't like that, Rose.

403
00:33:58,454 --> 00:33:59,788
She knows.

404
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,126
We'll both have the lamb.

405
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:06,378
Rare, with very little mint sauce.

406
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,047
You like lamb, right sweet pea?

407
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,886
You gonna cut her meat
for her too there, Cal?

408
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:19,308
Hey, who thought of the name <i>Titanic?</i>

409
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,143
Was it you, Bruce?

410
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,686
Yes, actually.

411
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,649
I wanted to convey sheer size.
And size means stability,

412
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,153
luxury, and above all, strength.

413
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,490
Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?

414
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,117
His ideas about
the male preoccupation with size

415
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,077
might be of particular interest to you.

416
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,830
What's gotten into you?

417
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,415
Excuse me.

418
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:49,338
I do apologize.

419
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,632
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

420
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:56,261
Well, I may have to start minding what she
reads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?

421
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,431
Freud? Who is he? Is he a passenger?

422
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,570
The ship is nice, huh?

423
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,531
Yeah. It's an Irish ship.

424
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,698
Is English, no?

425
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:17,825
No, it was built in Ireland.

426
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,743
15,000 Irishmen built this ship.

427
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,579
Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands.

428
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,248
That's typical.

429
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,417
First-class dogs
come down here to take a shite.

430
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,212
Lets us know where we rank
in the scheme of things.

431
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,089
Like we could forget?

432
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,925
I'm Tommy Ryan.

433
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:37,261
-Jack Dawson.
-Fabrizio.

434
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,889
Do you make any money with your drawings?

435
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,569
Forget it, boyo.

436
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:56,029
You'd as like have angels
fly out of your arse

437
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:57,614
as get next to the likes of her.

438
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:24,933
 <i>I saw my whole life</i> 
 <i>as if I'd already lived it.</i> 

439
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:28,812
 <i>An endless parade</i> 
 <i>of parties and cotillions,</i> 

440
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,148
 <i>yachts and polo matches.</i> 

441
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:36,486
 <i>Always the same narrow people,</i> 
 <i>the same mindless chatter.</i> 

442
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:40,824
 <i>I felt like I was standing</i> 
 <i>at a great precipice</i> 

443
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:44,077
 <i>with no one to pull me back.</i> 

444
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,913
 <i>No one who cared</i> 

445
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,165
 <i>or even noticed.</i> 

446
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,027
Don't do it.

447
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,112
Stay back.

448
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,406
Don't come any closer.

449
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,742
Come on.

450
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,368
Just give me your hand.
I'll pull you back over.

451
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,870
No! Stay where you are.

452
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,122
I mean it.

453
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,458
I'll let go.

454
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,970
No, you won't.

455
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,307
What do you mean, no I won't?

456
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,351
Don't presume to tell me
what I will and will not do.

457
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,603
You don't know me.

458
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,813
Well, you would have done it already.

459
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:19,649
{\an8}You're distracting me. Go away.

460
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,109
{\an8}I can't.

461
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,569
I'm involved now.

462
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:26,823
You let go, and I'm going to have
to jump in there after you.

463
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,160
Don't be absurd.

464
00:39:30,494 --> 00:39:32,662
-You'll be killed.
-I'm a good swimmer.

465
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,831
The fall alone will kill you.

466
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,876
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't.

467
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,587
Tell you the truth,

468
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,298
I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.

469
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,681
How cold?

470
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:55,227
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.

471
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:02,818
You ever been to Wisconsin?

472
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,239
What?

473
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:09,741
Well, they have some of
the coldest winters around.

474
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:12,911
I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

475
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,915
I remember when I was a kid,
me and my father, we went ice fishing

476
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,084
out on Lake Wissota.

477
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,838
-Ice fishing is, you know, where you...
-I know what ice fishing is!

478
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,257
Sorry.

479
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,095
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

480
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,431
Anyway, I...

481
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,434
I fell through some thin ice.

482
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,311
And I'm telling you,

483
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,273
water that cold,

484
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:43,275
like right down there,

485
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:47,404
it hits you like 1,000 knives
stabbing you all over your body.

486
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:53,118
You can't breathe. You can't think.

487
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,745
Least not about anything but the pain.

488
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:02,043
Which is why I'm not looking
forward to jumping in there after you.

489
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,129
Like I said,

490
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,632
I don't have a choice.

491
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,639
I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll
come back over the rail,

492
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,183
and get me off the hook here.

493
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,351
You're crazy.

494
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,855
That's what everybody says but,

495
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,983
with all due respect, miss,

496
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,861
I'm not the one hanging off
the back of a ship here.

497
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,030
Come on.

498
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,365
Come on, give me your hand.

499
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:34,534
You don't want to do this.

500
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,052
I'm Jack Dawson.

501
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,222
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

502
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,224
I'll have to get you to
write that one down.

503
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:00,936
Come on.

504
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,276
I got you. Come on.

505
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,403
Come on.

506
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,159
Help, please!

507
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:17,661
Help!

508
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,580
-Please, help me!
-Listen. Listen to me.

509
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,249
Listen. Listen to me.

510
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:24,084
I've got you. I won't let go.

511
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,378
Now pull yourself up. Come on!

512
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,716
Come on. That's right.

513
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:33,343
You can do it.

514
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:39,599
I got you.

515
00:42:45,272 --> 00:42:46,773
What's all this?

516
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,532
You stand back and don't move an inch!

517
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:58,785
Fetch the Master at Arms.

518
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,206
This is completely unacceptable!

519
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:06,126
What made you think that you could
put your hands on my fiancée?

520
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:08,962
Look at me, you filth!

521
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,589
-Cal.
-What do you think you were doing?

522
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,301
Cal, stop. It was an accident.

523
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:16,636
An accident?

524
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,263
It was.

525
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,432
Stupid, really.

526
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,768
I was leaning over and I slipped.

527
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:29,774
I was leaning far over to see the...

528
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,444
The...

529
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,739
-Propellers?
-Propellers, and I slipped.

530
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:39,617
And I would have gone overboard
but Mr. Dawson here saved me.

531
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,120
And almost went over himself.

532
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,164
You wanted to see the...
She wanted to see the propellers.

533
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,625
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

534
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,462
Was that the way of it?

535
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,966
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

536
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,801
Well, the boy's a hero then.

537
00:43:57,427 --> 00:43:58,845
Good for you, son. Well done.

538
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,931
So, it's all's well
and back to our brandy, eh?

539
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:06,519
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

540
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,981
Perhaps a little something for the boy?

541
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,485
Of course.

542
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:17,322
Mr. Lovejoy, I think a 20 should do it.

543
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,658
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

544
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,162
Rose is displeased.

545
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,498
What to do?

546
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,582
I know.

547
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:33,671
Perhaps you could join us for
dinner tomorrow evening

548
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:38,009
to regale our group with your heroic tale.

549
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:42,514
Sure. Count me in.

550
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,183
Good. It's settled then.

551
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,560
This should be interesting.

552
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:59,489
Can I bum a smoke?

553
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,541
You'll want to tie those.

554
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,294
It's interesting,

555
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,630
the young lady slipped so suddenly,

556
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:19,217
and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

557
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,402
I know you've been melancholy.

558
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,405
I don't pretend to know why.

559
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,243
I intended to save this

560
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:50,415
until the engagement gala next week,

561
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,085
but, I thought

562
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:55,753
tonight.

563
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,423
Good gracious.

564
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,093
Perhaps as a reminder
of my feelings for you.

565
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,220
-Is it a...
-Diamond. Yes.

566
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,893
56 carats to be exact.

567
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,272
It was worn by Louis XVI.

568
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:17,442
And they called it <i>Le Coeur de la Mer.</i>

569
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,069
-The Heart of the Ocean.
-The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.

570
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,911
It's overwhelming.

571
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,079
Well, it's for royalty.

572
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,458
We are royalty, Rose.

573
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,797
You know, there's
nothing I couldn't give you.

574
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,634
There's nothing I'd deny you

575
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,470
if you would not deny me.

576
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:51,976
Open your heart to me, Rose.

577
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:11,371
Well, I've been on my own since
I was 15, since my folks died.

578
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:16,459
And I had no brothers or sisters or
close kin in that part of the country,

579
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,296
so I lit on out of there
and I haven't been back since.

580
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,715
You could just call me a
tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

581
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:29,347
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck and

582
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:32,642
chewed over how great the weather's
been and how I grew up

583
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,563
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talk to me, is it?

584
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,525
-Mr. Dawson, I...
-Jack.

585
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:42,944
Jack.

586
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,614
I want to thank you for what you did.

587
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:51,369
Not just for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

588
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,037
You're welcome.

589
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,539
Look.

590
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:58,293
I know what you must be thinking.

591
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,169
Poor little rich girl.

592
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,463
What does she know about misery?

593
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:03,715
No.

594
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:06,884
No, that's not what I was thinking.

595
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,469
What I was thinking was

596
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:12,015
what could have happened to this girl
to make her think she had no way out?

597
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:15,685
Well I...

598
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,523
It was everything.
It was my whole world and

599
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:21,816
all the people in it.

600
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:25,653
And the inertia of my life,
plunging ahead and me,

601
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,697
powerless to stop it.

602
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,907
God, look at that thing.

603
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,368
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

604
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,581
500 invitations have gone out.

605
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,584
All of Philadelphia society will be there.

606
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:41,878
And all the while I feel I'm

607
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:45,882
standing in the middle of a crowded room
screaming at the top of my lungs

608
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,175
and no one even looks up.

609
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,094
Do you love him?

610
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:52,430
Pardon me?

611
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:54,223
Do you love him?

612
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:57,810
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

613
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,772
Well, it's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not?

614
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,276
This is not a suitable conversation.

615
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:06,861
Why can't you just answer the question?

616
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,407
This is absurd.

617
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,117
You don't know me and I don't know you,

618
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:16,496
and we are not having this
conversation at all. You are rude

619
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,957
and uncouth and presumptuous
and I am leaving now.

620
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,086
Jack. Mr. Dawson. It's been a pleasure.

621
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,046
I sought you out to thank you,
and now I have thanked you.

622
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,256
And you've insulted me.

623
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,092
Well, you deserved it.

624
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,468
-Right.
-Right.

625
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,098
I thought you were leaving.

626
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,641
I am.

627
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,186
You are so annoying.

628
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:42,605
Wait.

629
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,609
I don't have to leave.
This is my part of the ship. You leave.

630
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,488
Well, well, well. Now who's being rude?

631
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:57,161
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

632
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,665
So, what are you, an artist or something?

633
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,671
These are rather good.

634
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,177
They're very good, actually.

635
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,437
{\an8}Jack, this is exquisite work.

636
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,273
{\an8}They didn't think too
much of them in old Paree.

637
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:26,691
Paris?

638
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:30,653
You do get around for a...

639
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:36,325
-Well, a person of limited means.
-Go on.

640
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,369
A poor guy. You can say it.

641
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,374
Well, well, well.

642
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,338
And these were drawn from life?

643
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,886
Well, that's one of the good things
about Paris.

644
00:50:55,344 --> 00:50:56,804
Lots of girls are willing
to take their clothes off.

645
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,771
You liked this woman.

646
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,732
You used her several times.

647
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:09,901
Well.

648
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,528
She had beautiful hands, you see?

649
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,408
I think you must have
had a love affair with her.

650
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,911
No, no, no. Just with her hands.

651
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,914
She was a one-legged prostitute.

652
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,041
See?

653
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:33,591
She had a good sense of humor though.

654
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,094
Oh, and this lady.

655
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,058
{\an8}She used to sit at this bar every night

656
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,935
wearing every piece of jewelry she owned

657
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,395
just waiting for her long, lost love.

658
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:49,440
We called her <i>Madame</i> Bijoux.

659
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,776
See, her clothes are all moth-eaten.

660
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:56,280
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

661
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:57,949
You do.

662
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,784
You see people.

663
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:01,619
I see you.

664
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,373
And?

665
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,459
You wouldn't have jumped.

666
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:16,425
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

667
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,302
Rose has already done that.

668
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,472
Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

669
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,475
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

670
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,145
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

671
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,772
We're awfully sorry, you missed it.

672
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:33,401
The Countess and I were just
off to take the air on the boat deck.

673
00:52:33,609 --> 00:52:36,654
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

674
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,284
Countess.

675
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,663
So, you've not yet lit the
last four boilers?

676
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,623
No, I don't see the need.

677
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,625
We are making excellent time.

678
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:55,339
The press knows the size of <i>Titanic.</i>
Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.

679
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,842
We must give them something new to print.

680
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:03,097
This maiden voyage of <i>Titanic </i>must
make headlines.

681
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:08,311
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines

682
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,022
until they've been properly run in.

683
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:13,608
Of course, I'm just a passenger.

684
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,110
I leave it to your good offices
to decide what's best.

685
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,322
But what a glorious end
to your final crossing

686
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,115
if we were to get into New York
on Tuesday night

687
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:23,868
and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

688
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,662
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

689
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,667
Good man.

690
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,630
After that, I worked
on a squid boat in Monterey,

691
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:38,716
then I went to Los Angeles to the pier
in Santa Monica

692
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:41,969
and started doing portraits
for 10 cents a piece.

693
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:44,513
Why can't I be like you, Jack?

694
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:48,351
Just head out for the horizon
whenever I feel like it.

695
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,147
Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier,

696
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,524
even if we only ever just talk about it.

697
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,694
No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.

698
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:01,697
Ride on the roller coaster
till we throw up.

699
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:05,201
Then we'll ride horses on the beach,
right in the surf.

700
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:09,538
But you have to do it like a real cowboy.
None of that sidesaddle stuff.

701
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,708
-You mean with one leg on each side?
-Yeah.

702
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,252
Can you show me?

703
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:17,171
Sure, if you like.

704
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,383
Teach me to ride like a man.

705
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,009
Chew tobacco like a man.

706
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:26,055
And spit like a man.

707
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,848
They didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

708
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:29,225
No.

709
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,435
Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it.

710
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,437
I'll show you how.

711
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:36,565
Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.

712
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,902
No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack.

713
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:41,904
Watch closely.

714
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:45,408
That's disgusting.

715
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:46,575
Your turn.

716
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,914
That was pitiful.
You really have to hawk it back.

717
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:55,251
Get some leverage.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

718
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:58,587
You see the range on that thing?

719
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,589
Okay, go.

720
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:09,098
That was better. You have to work on it.
Really try to hawk it up.

721
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,399
Mother.

722
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:26,115
May I introduce Jack Dawson?

723
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:29,118
Charmed, I'm sure.

724
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:38,461
 <i>The others were gracious and curious</i> 
 <i>about the man who'd saved my life.</i> 

725
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:42,631
 <i>But my mother looked at him </i> 
 <i>like an insect.</i> 

726
00:55:43,132 --> 00:55:47,136
 <i>A dangerous insect</i> 
 <i>which must be squashed quickly.</i> 

727
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,307
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

728
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,981
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

729
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:00,983
Shall we go dress, Mother?

730
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,819
See you at dinner, Jack.

731
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:06,822
Son?

732
00:56:07,323 --> 00:56:08,491
Son!

733
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,327
Do you have the slightest comprehension
what you're doing?

734
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:13,329
Not really.

735
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:16,165
You're about to go into the snake pit.

736
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:20,294
What are you planning to wear?

737
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,341
I figured. Come on.

738
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,598
I was right. You and my son
are just about the same size.

739
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:34,350
Pretty close.

740
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,356
You shine up like a new penny.

741
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,869
Good evening, sir.

742
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,978
Thousands of tons of Hockley steel
are in this ship.

743
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,272
-Which part?
-All the right ones.

744
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:06,734
Then you're accountable
if there's a problem. Where's my daughter?

745
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:08,277
She'll be along.

746
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:11,322
There is the Countess. Hello, my dear.

747
00:58:39,475 --> 00:58:43,020
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and always wanted to do it.

748
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,619
Darling,

749
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:01,330
surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

750
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:03,499
Dawson.

751
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,795
It's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.

752
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,172
Almost.

753
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:11,966
This is extraordinary.

754
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:28,190
This is a remarkable voyage.

755
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:29,858
-Mad.
-Completely lunatic.

756
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:33,654
There's the Countess of Rothes.

757
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:38,701
That's John Jacob Astor,

758
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,036
the richest man on the ship.

759
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:45,207
His little wifey there, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

760
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,252
See how she's trying to hide it.

761
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,712
Quite the scandal.

762
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:54,133
Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,
<i>Madame</i> Aubert.

763
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:57,136
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with
the children, of course.

764
00:59:57,219 --> 01:00:00,556
And over here, Sir Cosmo
and Lucile, Lady Duff Gordon.

765
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:04,226
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her many talents.

766
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,770
Very popular with the royals.

767
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:09,565
Congratulations, Hockley. She's splendid.

768
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,400
Why, thank you.

769
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:13,694
Care to escort a lady to dinner?

770
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,404
Certainly.

771
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:18,741
Sweet pea, sweet pea.

772
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:21,035
Ain't nothing to it. Is there, Jack?

773
01:00:21,744 --> 01:00:26,248
They love money. Pretend like you own
a gold mine and you're in the club.

774
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,085
Hey, Astor.

775
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,589
Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.

776
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:36,759
J.J., Madeleine,
I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

777
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,135
-How do you do?
-Pleasure.

778
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,553
Well, Jack,

779
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,597
are you of the Boston Dawsons?

780
01:00:42,598 --> 01:00:45,225
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

781
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:46,810
Oh, yes.

782
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:52,775
 <i>He must have been nervous,</i> 
 <i>but he never faltered.</i> 

783
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:55,778
 <i>They assumed he was one of them.</i> 

784
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:59,281
 <i>Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.</i> 

785
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:03,786
 <i>New money, obviously,</i> 
 <i>but still a member of the club.</i> 

786
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:07,915
 <i>Mother, of course,</i> 
 <i>could always be counted upon.</i> 

787
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:13,420
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,
Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.

788
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:18,092
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

789
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:23,972
Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.

790
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,600
He was of help to my fiancée last night.

791
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:29,686
It happens Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

792
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,481
He showed me some of his work today.

793
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:36,193
Rose and I differ somewhat in
our definition of fine art.

794
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:37,820
Not to impugn your work, sir.

795
01:01:48,664 --> 01:01:49,665
Are all these mine?

796
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:52,000
Start from the outside
and work your way in.

797
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,420
He knows every rivet in her.
Don't you, Thomas?

798
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:57,089
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.

799
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,465
Thank you, Rose.

800
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,178
How do you take your caviar, sir?

801
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,682
No caviar for me, thanks.
Never did like it much.

802
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,228
Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

803
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:14,648
Right now, my address is the RMS<i> Titanic.</i>

804
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:16,859
After that, I'm on God's good humor.

805
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,319
How do you have means to travel?

806
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:24,366
I work my way from place to place.
Tramp steamers and such.

807
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:28,370
I won my ticket on Titanic
at a lucky hand at poker.

808
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,164
A very lucky hand.

809
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,041
All life is a game of luck.

810
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:37,171
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson?

811
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,676
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing, do you?

812
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,347
Yes, ma'am, I do.

813
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:51,101
I've got everything I need
right here with me.

814
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:54,229
I have air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

815
01:02:55,564 --> 01:02:58,942
I love waking up in the morning, not
knowing what's gonna happen

816
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,068
or who I'll meet.

817
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:02,362
Where I'll wind up.

818
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:05,032
Just the other night,
I was sleeping under a bridge,

819
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,659
now here I am
on the grandest ship in the world,

820
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,661
having champagne with you fine people.

821
01:03:09,745 --> 01:03:10,871
I'll take some more of that.

822
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,083
I figure life's a gift.
I don't intend on wasting it.

823
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,921
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

824
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:21,924
You learn to take life as it comes at you.
Here, Cal.

825
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,220
To make each day count.

826
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,055
Well said, Jack.

827
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,389
Hear, hear.

828
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,934
To making it count.

829
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:35,312
To making it count.

830
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,772
Bravo.

831
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:47,449
But Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

832
01:03:48,784 --> 01:03:52,788
He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating
and he lights a fire.

833
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,460
Next, it'll be brandy in the smoking room.

834
01:04:00,629 --> 01:04:02,756
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

835
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:06,552
Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke

836
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,096
and congratulate each other on being
masters of the universe.

837
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,306
Ladies, thank you for your company.

838
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:14,101
May I escort you to the cabin?

839
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,352
No, I'll stay here.

840
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,187
Here you go, Molly.

841
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,148
Joining us, Dawson?

842
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,818
You don't want to stay with the women.

843
01:04:23,318 --> 01:04:25,654
No, thanks. I have to head back.

844
01:04:25,988 --> 01:04:27,114
That's best.

845
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:30,659
It'll be all business and politics.
Wouldn't interest you.

846
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,454
But Dawson, good of you to come.

847
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:41,336
Must you go?

848
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,964
Time for me to row with the other slaves.

849
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,844
Good night, Rose.

850
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:31,386
So, you want to go to a real party?

851
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:44,024
Is okay I put my hand here?

852
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:05,587
I can't understand you.

853
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:40,247
I'm going to dance with her now.

854
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:41,415
Come on.

855
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:43,959
Come on. Come with me.

856
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,128
Jack. Jack, wait.

857
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:49,631
I can't do this.

858
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:51,591
We'll have to get a bit closer.

859
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,968
Like this.

860
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:57,973
You're still my best girl, Cora.

861
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,479
-I don't know the steps.
-Me, either. Just go with it.

862
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:06,273
Don't think.

863
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:28,003
Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!

864
01:07:37,846 --> 01:07:39,347
What? Wait!

865
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,224
Jack, no.

866
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,858
...beyond the jurisdiction
of the Sherman Act.

867
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:35,987
That's what Rockefeller said...
Supreme Court didn't swallow it.

868
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:59,761
What? You think
a first-class girl can't drink?

869
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,056
Get out of here.

870
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:04,933
Are you all right?

871
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:07,978
I'm fine.

872
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:10,230
Two out of three.

873
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,440
So,

874
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,610
you think you're big tough men?

875
01:09:16,945 --> 01:09:18,446
Let's see you do this.

876
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,451
Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.

877
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:42,262
Jesus!

878
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,638
You okay?

879
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,473
I haven't done that in years.

880
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:56,318
Come on, lads.
Give it all you got. Let's go.

881
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,720
Coffee, sir?

882
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,357
I had hoped you would
come to me last night.

883
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,069
I was tired.

884
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,407
Your exertions below deck
were no doubt exhausting.

885
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:50,914
I see you had
that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

886
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,209
You will never behave like that again.

887
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,757
I'm not one of your mill foremen
who you can command.

888
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,927
I'm your fiancée.

889
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,431
My fiancée. My fiancée!

890
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,100
Yes, you are! And my wife!

891
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:15,772
My wife in practice,
if not yet by law, so you will honor me!

892
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,984
You will honor me the way
a wife honors her husband.

893
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,486
Because I will not be made a fool of.

894
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,155
Is this in any way unclear?

895
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,199
No.

896
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,868
Good. Excuse me.

897
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:36,209
Oh, Miss Rose.

898
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,504
We had a little accident.

899
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:41,881
-That's all right.
-I'm sorry, Trudy.

900
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,341
Let me help you.

901
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,218
It's all right, miss.

902
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,226
It's all right, miss.

903
01:11:58,732 --> 01:12:00,066
Tea, Trudy.

904
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:01,985
Yes, ma'am.

905
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:20,754
You're not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me?

906
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,424
Rose, I forbid it.

907
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:28,678
Stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

908
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:30,430
This is not a game.

909
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:34,642
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

910
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:39,272
Of course I know it's gone.
You remind me every day.

911
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:45,236
Your father left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

912
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:48,198
That name is the only card
we have to play.

913
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,450
I don't understand you.

914
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:55,121
It is a fine match with Hockley.
It will ensure our survival.

915
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:58,124
How can you put this on me?

916
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,918
Why are you being so selfish?

917
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:02,253
I'm being selfish?

918
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:08,635
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress?

919
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:12,305
Is that what you want?

920
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:17,852
To see our fine things sold at auction?

921
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,314
Our memories scattered?

922
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,160
It's so unfair.

923
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,330
Of course it's unfair.

924
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:39,999
We're women.

925
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,671
Our choices are never easy.

926
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,363
 <i>Protect them by thy guiding hand</i> 

927
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:16,244
 <i>From every peril on the land</i> 

928
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:21,541
 <i>O, spirit whom the father sent</i> 

929
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:26,379
 <i>To spread abroad the firmament</i> 

930
01:14:26,713 --> 01:14:31,050
 <i>O, wind of heaven, by thy might</i> 

931
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:36,222
 <i>Save all who dare the eagle's flight</i> 

932
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:40,435
 <i>And keep them by thy watchful care</i> 

933
01:14:43,104 --> 01:14:45,481
-Hello, Mr. Andrews.
-Hello, Jack.

934
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,409
I need to talk to someone.

935
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,912
You're not supposed to be in here.

936
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,210
I was here last night, remember?

937
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:07,045
No. Now please turn around.

938
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:10,215
He'll tell you. I just need to talk...

939
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:13,468
Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater

940
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:16,763
are still appreciative of your assistance.

941
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,600
They asked me
to give you this in gratitude...

942
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:22,477
I don't want your money.

943
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:26,147
Also to remind you that
you hold a third class ticket

944
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:28,608
and that your presence here
is no longer appropriate.

945
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,235
Let me speak to Rose.

946
01:15:30,443 --> 01:15:34,447
Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson
returns to where he belongs

947
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:36,449
and that he stays there?

948
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,284
Yes, sir.

949
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:39,744
Come along, you.

950
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:44,958
 <i>Hear us when we cry to thee</i> 

951
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:49,796
 <i>For those in peril on the sea</i> 

952
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:52,632
Why are there two steering wheels?

953
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:54,425
We use this one near shore.

954
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:58,304
Excuse me, sir.
Another ice warning, from the <i>Noordam.</i>

955
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,931
Thank you, Sparks.

956
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:05,520
Not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

957
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:10,483
In fact, we're speeding up.
I've ordered the last boilers lit.

958
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,490
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like I showed you. That's right.

959
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,325
Okay, now let it go.

960
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,414
-It was good, wasn't it?
-Quite nice. That's excellent.

961
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:34,424
Mr. Andrews... Forgive me.

962
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:36,467
I did the sum in my head,

963
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:40,596
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

964
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:44,475
Forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

965
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:46,978
About half, actually.

966
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,272
Rose, you miss nothing, do you?

967
01:16:50,106 --> 01:16:52,275
In fact, I put in these new type davits

968
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,194
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one.

969
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,657
But it was thought, by some
the deck would look too cluttered.

970
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:02,452
So, I was overruled.

971
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,955
It's a waste of deck space
as it is on an unsinkable ship.

972
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:07,957
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

973
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,668
I have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

974
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,628
She's all the lifeboat you need.

975
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,965
Just keep heading aft. The next
stop will be the engine room.

976
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:25,683
Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.

977
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,853
-I need to talk to you.
-No, Jack. No.

978
01:17:30,355 --> 01:17:32,648
Jack. I'm engaged.

979
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,485
I'm marrying Cal.

980
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,403
I love Cal.

981
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,324
Rose,

982
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:46,329
you're no picnic. All right?
You're a spoiled little brat even.

983
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:51,167
But under that, you're the
most amazingly, astounding

984
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:53,169
wonderful girl,

985
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:55,630
woman, that I've ever known.

986
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:56,756
Jack, I...

987
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,550
No, let me try and get this out. You're...

988
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:05,014
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

989
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,225
I've got ten bucks in my pocket.

990
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,186
I have nothing to offer
you and I know that.

991
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,063
I understand.

992
01:18:12,939 --> 01:18:14,607
But I'm too involved now.

993
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,026
You jump, I jump. Remember?

994
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,695
I can't turn away without
knowing you'll be all right.

995
01:18:21,656 --> 01:18:23,032
That's all that I want.

996
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,535
Well, I'm fine.

997
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,205
I'll be fine. Really.

998
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:31,374
Really?

999
01:18:33,543 --> 01:18:35,044
I don't think so.

1000
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,172
They've got you trapped, Rose.

1001
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:39,715
And you're gonna die if you
don't break free.

1002
01:18:39,841 --> 01:18:42,635
Maybe not right away
because you're strong,

1003
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:47,390
but sooner or later that
fire that I love about you, Rose,

1004
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,268
that fire is gonna burn out.

1005
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:56,816
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1006
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,570
You're right.

1007
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:03,573
Only you can do that.

1008
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:11,080
I'm going back.

1009
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,707
Leave me alone.

1010
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,597
Tell Lucile about the disaster
you had with the stationers.

1011
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:30,558
Well, of course the invitations
had to be sent back, twice.

1012
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,809
Oh, my dear.

1013
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:33,478
And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns.

1014
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,855
Let me tell you what an
odyssey that has been.

1015
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,566
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1016
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:42,361
She knows I detest the color.
So, she did it only to spite me.

1017
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,447
If only you'd come to me sooner.

1018
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:47,366
Ruth saw some of my designs in
<i>La Mode Illustrée.</i>

1019
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,245
They were for the trousseau of the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest daughter.

1020
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:52,413
They were quite charming.

1021
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:54,582
But, I think you'll agree,
my dear, that together

1022
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:57,960
we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes.

1023
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:13,768
Hello, Jack.

1024
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,275
I changed my mind.

1025
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:28,491
They said you might be up here.

1026
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:32,828
Give me your hand.

1027
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:41,629
Now close your eyes.

1028
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,298
Go on.

1029
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,136
Now, step up.

1030
01:20:52,974 --> 01:20:54,225
Now, hold onto the railing.

1031
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,394
Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.

1032
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:57,478
I'm not.

1033
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,982
Now, step up onto the rail.

1034
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:06,988
Hold on. Hold on.

1035
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,240
Keep your eyes closed.

1036
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:11,158
Do you trust me?

1037
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:12,994
I trust you.

1038
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:23,838
All right,

1039
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:25,715
open your eyes.

1040
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:33,764
I'm flying.

1041
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:35,308
Jack.

1042
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:03,711
 <i>Come, Josephine, in my flying machine</i> 

1043
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:08,549
 <i>Going up she goes</i> 
 <i>Up she goes</i> 

1044
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,475
That was the last time
<i>Titanic </i>ever saw daylight.

1045
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,020
We're up to dusk the night of the sinking.

1046
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,231
Six hours to go.

1047
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:08,067
Incredible. There's Smith
and he's standing there,

1048
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,985
and he's got the iceberg warning
in his fucking hand,

1049
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:13,072
excuse me, his hand,
and he's ordering more speed.

1050
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:16,617
26 years of experience
working against him.

1051
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,911
He figures anything big
enough to sink the ship

1052
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,830
they're gonna see in time to turn.

1053
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:23,582
But the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

1054
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,793
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1055
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:29,296
Everything he knows is wrong.

1056
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:45,855
It's quite proper, I assure you.
This is the sitting room.

1057
01:23:47,732 --> 01:23:49,233
-Will this light do?
-What?

1058
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:51,944
Don't artists need good light?

1059
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:56,824
That is true, but I'm not used to
working in such horrible conditions.

1060
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:58,951
Monet!

1061
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,455
-Do you know his work?
-Of course.

1062
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:04,790
Look at his use of color here.
Isn't he great?

1063
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,042
I know. It's extraordinary.

1064
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,882
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1065
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,010
Should we be expecting him any time soon?

1066
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:20,055
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1067
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:24,518
That's nice.

1068
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,562
What is it, a sapphire?

1069
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:30,524
A diamond. A very rare diamond.

1070
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,906
Jack, I want you to draw me
like one of your French girls.

1071
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:39,658
Wearing this.

1072
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:41,160
All right.

1073
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:44,997
Wearing only this.

1074
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:24,245
The last thing I need is another picture
of me looking like a porcelain doll.

1075
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:29,166
As a paying customer

1076
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,088
I expect to get what I want.

1077
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:54,692
Over on the bed, the couch.

1078
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,910
Come. Lie down.

1079
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,748
-Tell me when it looks right.
-Keep that.

1080
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,959
Put your arm back the way it was.

1081
01:26:14,628 --> 01:26:17,798
Put that other arm up,
that hand right by your face there.

1082
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,301
Right.

1083
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,470
Now, head down.

1084
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:28,017
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

1085
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:32,187
And try to stay still.

1086
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,666
So serious.

1087
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:37,044
I believe you are blushing,
Mr. Big <i>Artiste.</i>

1088
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,385
I can't imagine<i> Monsieur</i> Monet blushing.

1089
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:47,388
He does landscapes.

1090
01:27:48,055 --> 01:27:50,224
-Just relax your face.
-Sorry.

1091
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,934
No laughing.

1092
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:25,926
My heart was pounding the whole time.

1093
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:30,264
It was the most erotic moment of my life,

1094
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,311
up until then, at least.

1095
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,522
So what happened next?

1096
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:42,067
You mean, did we do it?

1097
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:46,864
 <i>Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine.</i> 

1098
01:28:47,448 --> 01:28:49,950
 <i>Jack was very professional.</i> 

1099
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,126
Thank you.

1100
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:08,552
What are you doing?

1101
01:29:09,470 --> 01:29:11,722
Will you put this back in the safe for me?

1102
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,652
Gentlemen, would you excuse me.

1103
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,990
None of the stewards have seen her.

1104
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:33,744
This is absurd. It's a ship.

1105
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,996
There's only so many places she could be.

1106
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,956
Lovejoy, find her.

1107
01:29:55,265 --> 01:29:56,642
-Clear.
-Yes.

1108
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:01,855
I don't think I've ever
seen such a flat calm.

1109
01:30:02,356 --> 01:30:03,357
Like a mill pond.

1110
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:06,068
Not a breath of wind.

1111
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:10,197
It will make the bergs harder to see

1112
01:30:10,531 --> 01:30:12,449
with no breaking water at the base.

1113
01:30:23,961 --> 01:30:25,003
Well, I'm off.

1114
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:28,257
Maintain speed
and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

1115
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,050
Yes, sir.

1116
01:30:41,603 --> 01:30:43,897
It's getting cold. You look nice.

1117
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:45,566
Miss Rose?

1118
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,734
My drawings!

1119
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,012
Come on!

1120
01:31:18,098 --> 01:31:19,474
Wait, wait, wait!

1121
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,143
Wait, wait, wait!

1122
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,645
-Go. Go. Down, down.
-Take us down, quickly. Quickly!

1123
01:31:31,028 --> 01:31:32,029
Bye.

1124
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:40,871
Sorry.

1125
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:48,462
-Keep going.
-Thank you, I've got it.

1126
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:00,557
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

1127
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,476
Seems more like a cop.

1128
01:32:02,684 --> 01:32:03,769
I think he was.

1129
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,104
-Oh, shit.
-Go!

1130
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,486
No, over here!

1131
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:13,987
Quick!

1132
01:32:20,494 --> 01:32:22,162
Now what?

1133
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:23,747
What?

1134
01:32:29,002 --> 01:32:30,671
More coal for number one, mate.

1135
01:32:30,921 --> 01:32:33,423
Hold up? What are you two doing down here?

1136
01:32:34,007 --> 01:32:35,008
You shouldn't be down here.

1137
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:36,385
It could be dangerous!

1138
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:41,765
Carry on!

1139
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,101
Don't mind us. You're doing a great job!

1140
01:32:44,268 --> 01:32:45,769
Keep up the good work!

1141
01:33:02,035 --> 01:33:04,037
Look at what we have here, huh?

1142
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,557
Thank you.

1143
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:37,070
Where to, miss?

1144
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:39,906
To the stars.

1145
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:00,427
You nervous?

1146
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,014
No.

1147
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:22,949
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1148
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,517
 <i>It's bloody cold.</i> 

1149
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:52,521
You know, I can smell ice, you know.
When it's near.

1150
01:34:53,814 --> 01:34:55,148
Bollocks!

1151
01:34:55,482 --> 01:34:57,150
Well, I can, all right?

1152
01:34:57,484 --> 01:34:59,569
Did you ever find those
binoculars for the lookouts?

1153
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,655
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1154
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:03,657
Well, I'll be on my rounds.

1155
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,575
Cheerio.

1156
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:38,191
You're trembling.

1157
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:41,695
Don't worry.

1158
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,572
I'll be all right.

1159
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:06,720
-They ran down there.
-Right.

1160
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:18,148
Anything missing?

1161
01:36:43,173 --> 01:36:45,008
I have a better idea.

1162
01:36:57,896 --> 01:36:59,022
Got you!

1163
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:11,117
Did you see those guys' faces?

1164
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:13,537
Did you see them?

1165
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:21,711
When the ship docks,

1166
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:24,798
I'm getting off with you.

1167
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:27,133
This is crazy.

1168
01:37:27,217 --> 01:37:30,220
I know. It doesn't make any sense.

1169
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,223
That's why I trust it.

1170
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:44,901
Here, look at this.

1171
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:47,737
Look at that, would you?

1172
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:49,573
They're warmer than we are.

1173
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:54,327
If that's what it takes for us
to get warm, I'd rather not.

1174
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:08,091
Bugger me!

1175
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:14,931
Pick up, you bastards!

1176
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:19,811
 <i>Is anyone there?</i> 

1177
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,021
What do you see?

1178
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,689
Iceberg, right ahead!

1179
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:24,024
Thank you.

1180
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,360
Iceberg ahead!

1181
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:29,529
Hard a' starboard!

1182
01:38:36,453 --> 01:38:38,705
{\an8}Turn! Turn! Smartly!

1183
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:44,919
Full astern!

1184
01:38:47,297 --> 01:38:48,298
Hard over.

1185
01:38:48,465 --> 01:38:50,133
Helm's hard over, sir.

1186
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:55,305
Go, lads, go!

1187
01:38:57,724 --> 01:39:00,518
Bring that steam down! Bring it down!

1188
01:39:02,354 --> 01:39:05,148
Shut all the dampers! Shut them!

1189
01:39:10,070 --> 01:39:11,071
Hold it.

1190
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:13,823
Hold it!

1191
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,993
Now! Engage reversing engine!

1192
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:47,524
Why ain't they turning?

1193
01:39:47,774 --> 01:39:48,942
Is it hard over?

1194
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:51,194
It is, sir. Hard over.

1195
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:59,369
Come on, come on, come on. Turn.

1196
01:40:10,547 --> 01:40:11,881
Yes.

1197
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:18,722
It's going to hit!

1198
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:31,651
Jesus Christ!

1199
01:40:52,422 --> 01:40:53,590
Jesus!

1200
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:54,841
Hard to port!

1201
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:56,426
Hard to port!

1202
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:07,812
Get back!

1203
01:41:37,217 --> 01:41:38,551
Come on. Let's go!

1204
01:41:38,802 --> 01:41:42,138
They're closing the doors! Get out!

1205
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:50,980
Get out the door! Go!

1206
01:41:51,314 --> 01:41:54,317
Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go!

1207
01:42:03,993 --> 01:42:05,662
Go! Go!

1208
01:42:06,162 --> 01:42:08,164
Out! Out!

1209
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:24,430
Oh, my God.

1210
01:42:25,265 --> 01:42:26,641
That was a close shave.

1211
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:29,686
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

1212
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:36,776
Note the time. Enter it in the log.

1213
01:42:42,532 --> 01:42:44,200
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

1214
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:46,536
An iceberg, sir.

1215
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:51,124
I put her hard to starboard,
but it was too close.

1216
01:42:51,457 --> 01:42:53,626
I tried to port round it, but...

1217
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:57,130
-Close the watertight doors.
-They're closed, sir.

1218
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,093
-All stop.
-Aye, sir.

1219
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:13,021
Have the carpenter sound the ship.

1220
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:27,994
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!

1221
01:43:32,832 --> 01:43:35,668
Why have the engines stopped?
I felt a shudder.

1222
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:38,588
Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade.

1223
01:43:38,838 --> 01:43:41,674
That's the shudder you felt.
Do you need anything?

1224
01:43:42,508 --> 01:43:43,593
No, thank you.

1225
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:51,059
There's talk of an iceberg.

1226
01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:53,061
I don't see anything. Do you?

1227
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:58,358
If this is the direction the rats are
going, that's good enough for me

1228
01:44:05,365 --> 01:44:07,200
-You, there.
-There is no emergency.

1229
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:10,119
-There is. I've been robbed.
-Get the Master at Arms.

1230
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:12,372
-Now, you moron!
-Yes, sir.

1231
01:44:17,043 --> 01:44:18,378
Did I miss the fun?

1232
01:44:19,545 --> 01:44:21,464
-Did you see what happened?
-No. I missed it

1233
01:44:21,631 --> 01:44:23,383
Apparently, it hit over there.

1234
01:44:24,384 --> 01:44:28,638
Boiler room six is flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1235
01:44:28,888 --> 01:44:31,349
-Can you shore up?
-Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1236
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:34,769
-Have you seen the mail hold?
-It's already underwater.

1237
01:44:35,353 --> 01:44:37,021
This is bad.

1238
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:40,900
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1239
01:44:41,985 --> 01:44:44,070
I think they're very good, sir.

1240
01:44:46,906 --> 01:44:49,909
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.

1241
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:57,083
We've been looking for you, miss.

1242
01:45:01,921 --> 01:45:03,006
Here we go.

1243
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:10,346
Something serious has happened.

1244
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:13,474
Yes, it has.

1245
01:45:14,976 --> 01:45:18,396
Indeed. Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1246
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:22,775
Now that one is back, I know
where to find the other. Search him.

1247
01:45:23,026 --> 01:45:24,861
-Take your coat off, son.
-Now what?

1248
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:30,033
Cal, what are you doing?
We're in the middle of an emergency.

1249
01:45:30,283 --> 01:45:32,368
-Is this it?
-That's it.

1250
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:34,787
This is horseshit!

1251
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:37,707
Don't you believe it, Rose.

1252
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:41,127
-He couldn't have.
-Easy enough for a professional.

1253
01:45:41,377 --> 01:45:43,880
I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.

1254
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:47,133
Perhaps he did it while you were putting
your clothes back on, dear.

1255
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:51,095
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1256
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:54,182
-Shut up.
-It isn't even your pocket.

1257
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,933
"Property of A.L. Ryerson."

1258
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:01,773
That was reported stolen today.

1259
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,733
I just borrowed it.
I was going to return it.

1260
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:06,319
We have an honest thief.

1261
01:46:06,486 --> 01:46:08,654
You know I didn't do this, Rose.

1262
01:46:09,489 --> 01:46:11,657
Don't you believe them, Rose. You know it.

1263
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:12,742
Let's go, son. Come on.

1264
01:46:12,825 --> 01:46:14,869
You know I didn't do it, Rose!

1265
01:46:15,161 --> 01:46:18,164
There's a good lad. Come on, son.

1266
01:46:18,498 --> 01:46:20,958
You know I didn't do it! You know me!

1267
01:46:22,752 --> 01:46:25,004
This is most unfortunate, Captain.

1268
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:31,928
Water 14 feet above the keel
in ten minutes

1269
01:46:32,178 --> 01:46:35,556
in the forepeak,
all three holds and boiler room six.

1270
01:46:35,807 --> 01:46:36,808
That's right, sir.

1271
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:38,434
When can we get underway? Damn it.

1272
01:46:38,518 --> 01:46:40,645
That's five compartments.

1273
01:46:42,522 --> 01:46:46,526
She can float with four compartments
breached, but not five.

1274
01:46:47,193 --> 01:46:50,863
Not five. As she goes down by the head,
the water will spill

1275
01:46:51,114 --> 01:46:55,284
over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,
from one to the next

1276
01:46:55,535 --> 01:46:58,204
back and back. There's no stopping it.

1277
01:46:58,538 --> 01:46:59,789
The pumps.

1278
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:03,209
The pumps buy you time, but minutes only.

1279
01:47:03,876 --> 01:47:06,129
From this moment, no matter what we do,

1280
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:09,215
 <i>Titanic </i>will founder.

1281
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:12,885
But this ship can't sink.

1282
01:47:13,136 --> 01:47:15,972
She's made of iron. I assure you, she can.

1283
01:47:16,556 --> 01:47:17,598
And she will.

1284
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:20,518
It's a mathematical certainty.

1285
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:26,399
How much time?

1286
01:47:33,906 --> 01:47:36,409
An hour. Two, at most.

1287
01:47:42,415 --> 01:47:44,500
How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

1288
01:47:44,917 --> 01:47:47,753
Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir.

1289
01:47:54,427 --> 01:47:57,930
Well, I believe you may
get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

1290
01:48:15,448 --> 01:48:17,617
It is a little slut, isn't it?

1291
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:20,620
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1292
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:23,039
-Mr. Hockley?
-Not now. We're busy.

1293
01:48:23,289 --> 01:48:26,709
You've been asked to put on lifebelts
and go to the boat deck.

1294
01:48:26,959 --> 01:48:27,960
I said, not now.

1295
01:48:28,211 --> 01:48:33,216
I'm sorry, Mr. Hockley,
but it's Captain's orders. Dress warmly.

1296
01:48:33,466 --> 01:48:35,635
It's quite cold out tonight.

1297
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,804
May I suggest topcoats and hats?

1298
01:48:39,138 --> 01:48:40,973
This is ridiculous.

1299
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:45,353
Not to worry, miss.
I'm sure it's just a precaution.

1300
01:48:45,686 --> 01:48:47,647
Everybody up! Lifebelts on!

1301
01:48:49,315 --> 01:48:50,900
What's he on about?

1302
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:53,653
-Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on!
-What's the ruckus?

1303
01:48:53,903 --> 01:48:55,238
Just put your lifebelts on.

1304
01:48:56,489 --> 01:48:57,657
{\an8}CQD?

1305
01:48:58,324 --> 01:48:59,492
Sir?

1306
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:04,997
That's right, CQD. The distress call.
That's our position.

1307
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:14,840
Tell whoever responds we're going down
by the head and need immediate assistance.

1308
01:49:24,392 --> 01:49:25,726
Blimey.

1309
01:49:35,861 --> 01:49:37,697
Keep lowering!

1310
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,032
Keep lowering!

1311
01:49:43,869 --> 01:49:47,707
Steady! Make it taut! And winch out!

1312
01:49:51,544 --> 01:49:55,548
Uncover this boat!
Uncover all the boats aft!

1313
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:57,550
Release those ties!

1314
01:49:57,883 --> 01:50:00,636
Roll back that cover! Smartly now!

1315
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:02,722
Where are the passengers?

1316
01:50:02,847 --> 01:50:06,350
They went inside.
Too cold and noisy for them.

1317
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,896
You there! Get down here
and help with these lines!

1318
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:26,912
Care for a drink, sir?

1319
01:50:29,415 --> 01:50:31,500
Sonny, what's doing?

1320
01:50:31,584 --> 01:50:34,337
You get us all trussed up
and now we're cooling our heels.

1321
01:50:34,587 --> 01:50:37,089
Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out.

1322
01:50:37,757 --> 01:50:40,092
Nobody knows what's going on.

1323
01:50:40,343 --> 01:50:43,262
Just like the damn English,
everything by the book.

1324
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:46,307
No need for language, Mr. Hockley.

1325
01:50:46,474 --> 01:50:48,851
Go back and turn the heaters on
in our rooms.

1326
01:50:48,934 --> 01:50:50,770
I'd like a cup of tea when I return.

1327
01:50:50,853 --> 01:50:51,937
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

1328
01:51:02,114 --> 01:51:03,115
Mr. Andrews.

1329
01:51:05,117 --> 01:51:08,454
I saw the iceberg.
And I see it in your eyes.

1330
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,331
Please tell me the truth.

1331
01:51:18,631 --> 01:51:20,466
The ship will sink.

1332
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:24,178
-You're certain?
-Yes.

1333
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:29,183
In an hour or so, all this
will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1334
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:31,769
What?

1335
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:36,357
Please, tell only who you must. I don't
want to be responsible for a panic.

1336
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:39,318
And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait.

1337
01:51:39,985 --> 01:51:43,155
You remember what I told you
about the boats?

1338
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:46,826
Yes.

1339
01:51:48,661 --> 01:51:50,162
I understand.

1340
01:51:58,170 --> 01:51:59,505
Over here, son.

1341
01:52:00,506 --> 01:52:02,842
Sir, they need you up in
the Second Class Purser's office.

1342
01:52:03,134 --> 01:52:05,761
-There's a big mob up there.
-Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

1343
01:52:06,512 --> 01:52:08,514
Aye. Right.

1344
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:27,199
Sir, <i>Carpathia</i> says they're
making 17 knots. Full steam for them, sir.

1345
01:52:29,034 --> 01:52:30,453
She's the only one responding?

1346
01:52:30,703 --> 01:52:34,290
The only one close, sir.
She says they can be here in four hours.

1347
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,709
Four hours?

1348
01:52:41,714 --> 01:52:43,215
Thank you, Bride.

1349
01:52:47,553 --> 01:52:49,221
My God.

1350
01:52:58,731 --> 01:53:00,733
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1351
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:06,155
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir?

1352
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:09,074
Yes.

1353
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:10,534
Sir?

1354
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:16,415
Women and children first, yes.

1355
01:53:17,917 --> 01:53:19,251
Yes, sir.

1356
01:53:22,087 --> 01:53:24,757
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please!

1357
01:53:25,257 --> 01:53:27,760
Step this way, please. That's right.

1358
01:53:28,093 --> 01:53:30,930
Come towards me. Thank you.

1359
01:53:31,931 --> 01:53:32,973
Good.

1360
01:53:33,224 --> 01:53:37,478
For the time being,
I require only women and children.

1361
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:39,146
Right here.

1362
01:53:39,772 --> 01:53:43,776
All right, boys, like the Captain said,
nice and cheery, so there's no panic.

1363
01:53:44,777 --> 01:53:46,111
"Wedding Dance."

1364
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:57,122
Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on.

1365
01:53:57,456 --> 01:54:00,125
Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on.

1366
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:03,462
Here, put that lifebelt on.
Turn it around.

1367
01:54:08,801 --> 01:54:11,136
It isn't time to go to the boats yet!

1368
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:13,138
Please, stay calm.

1369
01:54:13,472 --> 01:54:16,684
Make sure you have your lifebelts on.

1370
01:54:17,017 --> 01:54:19,520
Allow the women and children
through to the front.

1371
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:21,021
What are we doing, Mommy?

1372
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:24,316
Waiting, dear. When they finish putting
first-class people in the boats,

1373
01:54:24,567 --> 01:54:27,903
they'll be starting with us, and we want
to be all ready. Won't we?

1374
01:54:29,321 --> 01:54:31,574
Pushing won't get you out any faster.

1375
01:54:31,657 --> 01:54:32,992
Go get help.

1376
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:37,329
Lower it away,
left and right together! Steady.

1377
01:54:37,997 --> 01:54:41,000
Both sides together! Steady!

1378
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:42,501
Steady!

1379
01:54:42,835 --> 01:54:44,169
Steady!

1380
01:54:45,671 --> 01:54:47,673
Stop, stop, stop!

1381
01:54:48,507 --> 01:54:49,675
Hold the left!

1382
01:54:50,009 --> 01:54:52,511
Right side only! Right side only!

1383
01:54:52,845 --> 01:54:54,138
Right side only!

1384
01:54:54,221 --> 01:54:58,225
Hold the left side! Right side down!
Lower away together!

1385
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:02,062
Steady, lads!

1386
01:55:49,401 --> 01:55:52,655
You know, I do believe this ship may sink.

1387
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:59,036
I've been asked to give you
this small token of our appreciation.

1388
01:56:02,081 --> 01:56:04,750
Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

1389
01:56:11,507 --> 01:56:14,176
Come on, sister, you heard
the man. Into the boat.

1390
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:16,595
Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen?

1391
01:56:16,845 --> 01:56:18,180
Only women at this time, sir.

1392
01:56:21,558 --> 01:56:23,936
Will the lifeboats be
seated according to class?

1393
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:28,524
I hope they're not too crowded.

1394
01:56:29,274 --> 01:56:31,110
Mother, shut up!

1395
01:56:32,027 --> 01:56:33,195
Don't you understand?

1396
01:56:33,696 --> 01:56:35,406
The water is freezing
and there aren't enough boats.

1397
01:56:35,698 --> 01:56:37,282
Not enough by half.

1398
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:40,703
Half the people on this
ship are going to die.

1399
01:56:41,036 --> 01:56:42,621
Not the better half.

1400
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:45,582
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1401
01:56:46,166 --> 01:56:48,043
First class seats are right up here.

1402
01:56:49,211 --> 01:56:51,046
You know, it's a pity I didn't
keep that drawing.

1403
01:56:51,171 --> 01:56:52,756
It'll be worth a lot more by morning.

1404
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:59,388
You unimaginable bastard.

1405
01:57:00,055 --> 01:57:02,224
Come on, Rose darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1406
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:05,144
Come on, Rose.

1407
01:57:05,644 --> 01:57:07,271
You're next, darling.

1408
01:57:07,604 --> 01:57:08,731
Come into the boat, Rose.

1409
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,192
Come.

1410
01:57:12,526 --> 01:57:13,569
Rose.

1411
01:57:14,403 --> 01:57:15,654
Get into the boat!

1412
01:57:16,613 --> 01:57:17,614
Rose.

1413
01:57:19,324 --> 01:57:20,492
Good-bye, Mother.

1414
01:57:22,578 --> 01:57:24,580
Rose? Rose, come back here.

1415
01:57:24,663 --> 01:57:26,165
Where are you going?

1416
01:57:26,915 --> 01:57:27,916
To him?

1417
01:57:28,876 --> 01:57:30,377
To be a whore to a gutter rat?

1418
01:57:31,587 --> 01:57:33,922
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

1419
01:57:36,300 --> 01:57:37,342
No!

1420
01:57:37,426 --> 01:57:38,427
No!

1421
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:40,512
I said, no!

1422
01:57:42,431 --> 01:57:44,808
Rose! Please, stop!

1423
01:57:45,476 --> 01:57:47,394
-And, lower away!
-Rose!

1424
01:57:48,729 --> 01:57:49,688
No, Wait!

1425
01:57:49,813 --> 01:57:50,814
Lower away!

1426
01:57:50,898 --> 01:57:52,775
-Rose!
-Lower together!

1427
01:57:53,442 --> 01:57:54,818
Hold the left side!

1428
01:57:58,530 --> 01:57:59,531
Help!

1429
01:58:00,616 --> 01:58:02,701
Can anybody hear me?

1430
01:58:03,911 --> 01:58:05,788
Hello! Help me!

1431
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,623
Help me!

1432
01:58:08,457 --> 01:58:10,459
Can you hear me?

1433
01:58:10,793 --> 01:58:14,797
Can anybody hear me? Somebody help me!

1434
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,466
Mr. Andrews?

1435
01:58:21,136 --> 01:58:23,305
-Steward, check the starboard corridor.
-Yes, Mr. Andrews,

1436
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:26,099
Madam, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.

1437
01:58:26,683 --> 01:58:29,311
Lucy, for God's sake put on your
lifebelt and set a good example.

1438
01:58:29,394 --> 01:58:30,395
Yes, sir.

1439
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,314
-Anyone in here?
-Mr. Andrews!

1440
01:58:32,648 --> 01:58:34,483
Mr. Andrews! Thank God!

1441
01:58:34,733 --> 01:58:37,069
Where would the Master at Arms
take someone under arrest?

1442
01:58:37,194 --> 01:58:39,530
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.

1443
01:58:39,655 --> 01:58:42,407
No! I'm doing this
with or without your help, sir.

1444
01:58:42,991 --> 01:58:44,535
But without will take longer.

1445
01:58:46,286 --> 01:58:50,415
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go to the left down the crewmen's passage.

1446
01:58:50,499 --> 01:58:53,210
Then go right
and left again at the stairs.

1447
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:54,545
You'll come to a long corridor.

1448
01:58:59,508 --> 01:59:01,176
This could be bad.

1449
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:07,724
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1450
01:59:13,021 --> 01:59:15,023
Excuse me. Thank you.

1451
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:17,484
-Lifts are closed.
-I do not care what you think, sir.

1452
01:59:17,568 --> 01:59:18,569
Lifts are...

1453
01:59:18,652 --> 01:59:21,530
I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed.

1454
01:59:22,364 --> 01:59:24,950
I'm through being polite, god damn it!

1455
01:59:25,033 --> 01:59:26,410
Now take me down!

1456
01:59:27,703 --> 01:59:29,037
E deck.

1457
01:59:32,374 --> 01:59:33,709
Come on.

1458
01:59:34,126 --> 01:59:35,460
Come on, come on.

1459
01:59:53,353 --> 01:59:54,688
I'm going back up.

1460
01:59:54,730 --> 01:59:56,899
No! No! No!

1461
02:00:01,069 --> 02:00:02,905
Come back! I'm going back up!

1462
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:04,239
I'm going back up!

1463
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:14,249
Crew passage.

1464
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:38,565
Jack!

1465
02:00:51,495 --> 02:00:52,537
Rose!

1466
02:00:53,747 --> 02:00:54,748
Jack!

1467
02:00:54,831 --> 02:00:56,208
Rose, I'm in here!

1468
02:00:56,792 --> 02:00:58,585
-I'm in here!
-Jack.

1469
02:00:58,669 --> 02:01:01,129
-I'm in here! Rose!
-Jack!

1470
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:03,966
Jack! I'm sorry.

1471
02:01:04,299 --> 02:01:06,635
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1472
02:01:07,761 --> 02:01:09,096
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.

1473
02:01:09,221 --> 02:01:11,056
I know, I know, I know.

1474
02:01:11,181 --> 02:01:12,265
Listen, Rose,

1475
02:01:12,349 --> 02:01:14,810
you're gonna have to find
a spare key, all right?

1476
02:01:14,893 --> 02:01:16,228
Look in that cabinet right there.

1477
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:19,648
It's a little silver one, Rose.

1478
02:01:22,234 --> 02:01:23,735
These are all brass ones!

1479
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:26,113
Check right here, Rose.

1480
02:01:30,659 --> 02:01:31,660
Rose.

1481
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:34,496
How did you find out I didn't do it?

1482
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,081
I didn't.

1483
02:01:36,164 --> 02:01:38,208
I just realized I already knew.

1484
02:01:40,794 --> 02:01:41,795
Keep looking.

1485
02:01:51,138 --> 02:01:52,180
No key.

1486
02:01:52,723 --> 02:01:53,765
There's no key!

1487
02:01:53,849 --> 02:01:54,850
All right, Rose, listen.

1488
02:01:55,183 --> 02:01:56,560
You're gonna have to go find some help.

1489
02:01:57,394 --> 02:01:58,395
It'll be all right.

1490
02:02:03,817 --> 02:02:05,235
I'll be right back.

1491
02:02:12,826 --> 02:02:14,661
I'll just wait here!

1492
02:02:27,632 --> 02:02:29,176
Hello? Is there anyone here?

1493
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:31,386
Hello?

1494
02:02:32,012 --> 02:02:33,638
Is there anybody down here?

1495
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:36,683
We need help! Hello?

1496
02:02:38,226 --> 02:02:39,227
Damn it!

1497
02:02:45,859 --> 02:02:49,696
Can anybody hear me, please? Hello? Hello?

1498
02:02:51,698 --> 02:02:53,033
Oh, thank God.

1499
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:54,367
Wait, please, I need your help.

1500
02:02:54,451 --> 02:02:55,786
There's a man back here, and he's...

1501
02:02:56,536 --> 02:02:57,537
Wait!

1502
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:03,085
Hello?

1503
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:29,903
Hello?

1504
02:03:31,363 --> 02:03:32,864
Miss, you shouldn't be here now.

1505
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:34,741
-I need your help.
-This way, quickly.

1506
02:03:34,825 --> 02:03:36,409
There is a man down
here and he is trapped.

1507
02:03:36,493 --> 02:03:37,869
-This way, yes. All right.
-Please!

1508
02:03:37,953 --> 02:03:40,038
-There's no need to panic.
-No, I'm not panicking!

1509
02:03:40,122 --> 02:03:42,207
You're going the wrong way!

1510
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,792
Let go of me! Listen!

1511
02:03:49,631 --> 02:03:50,632
To hell with you.

1512
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:30,172
Oh, my God.

1513
02:05:22,265 --> 02:05:23,850
Will this work?

1514
02:05:24,768 --> 02:05:25,852
I guess we'll find out.

1515
02:05:26,519 --> 02:05:27,520
Come on.

1516
02:05:30,565 --> 02:05:31,566
Wait, wait, wait.

1517
02:05:32,234 --> 02:05:33,735
Try a couple practice swings over there.

1518
02:05:39,950 --> 02:05:40,951
Good.

1519
02:05:41,243 --> 02:05:43,036
Now try and hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1520
02:05:49,751 --> 02:05:52,212
Okay, that's enough practice.
Come on, Rose.

1521
02:05:52,379 --> 02:05:54,256
You can do it.

1522
02:05:54,339 --> 02:05:57,926
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1523
02:05:59,302 --> 02:06:00,595
Come on. Wait.

1524
02:06:00,679 --> 02:06:02,973
Open your hands up a little more.

1525
02:06:03,306 --> 02:06:04,641
-Like that?
-Right.

1526
02:06:05,642 --> 02:06:07,686
Listen, Rose, I trust you.

1527
02:06:12,607 --> 02:06:13,608
Go.

1528
02:06:19,948 --> 02:06:20,991
You did it!

1529
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:22,951
Come on. Let's go.

1530
02:06:23,618 --> 02:06:27,539
Oh shit, this is cold!
Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!

1531
02:06:33,128 --> 02:06:34,254
This is the way out.

1532
02:06:35,297 --> 02:06:37,799
We have to find another way. Come on.

1533
02:06:40,844 --> 02:06:41,845
Pull.

1534
02:06:42,887 --> 02:06:43,930
Put your backs into it.

1535
02:06:49,894 --> 02:06:50,895
Pull!

1536
02:06:51,813 --> 02:06:54,649
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

1537
02:07:16,504 --> 02:07:19,341
What's this luggage doing here?
Get rid of it. Get rid of it.

1538
02:07:19,466 --> 02:07:21,760
We need the room. Get rid of that. Out.

1539
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:25,430
This way. Let go, sir. Get back.

1540
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:27,057
Keep calm!

1541
02:07:34,356 --> 02:07:35,357
Lovejoy!

1542
02:07:35,732 --> 02:07:37,734
She's not on the starboard side either.

1543
02:07:38,193 --> 02:07:42,197
We're running out of time. This strutting
martinet isn't letting any men on at all.

1544
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:44,824
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1545
02:07:45,575 --> 02:07:46,868
Well then, that's our play.

1546
02:07:47,369 --> 02:07:49,496
We'll need some insurance first. Come on.

1547
02:07:50,372 --> 02:07:52,457
This way, please. All the way down here.

1548
02:07:55,543 --> 02:07:56,544
Here!

1549
02:07:57,754 --> 02:07:59,047
What do you think you're doing?

1550
02:07:59,547 --> 02:08:01,549
You'll have to pay for that, you know.

1551
02:08:01,966 --> 02:08:03,968
That's White Star Line property.

1552
02:08:04,052 --> 02:08:05,553
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

1553
02:08:06,346 --> 02:08:09,682
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run back to my room...

1554
02:08:10,392 --> 02:08:11,434
Sit down!

1555
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:13,103
She's the last.

1556
02:08:13,269 --> 02:08:15,021
-Prepare to lower.
-Mr. Lightoller.

1557
02:08:15,188 --> 02:08:17,273
Why are the boats being
launched half full?

1558
02:08:17,357 --> 02:08:18,358
Not now, Mr. Andrews.

1559
02:08:18,441 --> 02:08:21,820
There, look. 20 or so
in a boat built for 65?

1560
02:08:22,028 --> 02:08:24,197
And I saw one boat with only 12. 12!

1561
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:27,409
Well, we weren't sure of
the weight, Mr. Andrews.

1562
02:08:27,492 --> 02:08:28,868
These boats may buckle.

1563
02:08:28,952 --> 02:08:30,036
Rubbish!

1564
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:32,747
They were tested in Belfast
with the weight of 70 men.

1565
02:08:32,831 --> 02:08:35,625
Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.
For God's sake man!

1566
02:08:43,049 --> 02:08:45,885
Please, I need more women
and children, please!

1567
02:08:51,266 --> 02:08:52,434
Get back in there!

1568
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:55,270
This is not an exit. This is not an exit.

1569
02:08:57,814 --> 02:09:00,483
You can't keep us locked in here.
Like animals. The ship's bloody sinking.

1570
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:03,736
Bring forward the women!

1571
02:09:04,070 --> 02:09:05,572
Unlock the gates.

1572
02:09:06,406 --> 02:09:08,408
Women only!

1573
02:09:09,075 --> 02:09:10,743
No men!

1574
02:09:11,077 --> 02:09:12,579
No men!

1575
02:09:17,083 --> 02:09:18,960
Get back!

1576
02:09:20,253 --> 02:09:21,337
Get back!

1577
02:09:21,421 --> 02:09:22,797
Lock the gates!

1578
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:24,966
Get them back from those gates!

1579
02:09:26,342 --> 02:09:27,635
Don't touch the gates!

1580
02:09:31,306 --> 02:09:32,682
For God's sake, man,

1581
02:09:32,765 --> 02:09:34,309
there are women and children down here!

1582
02:09:34,642 --> 02:09:36,978
Let us up so we can have a chance!

1583
02:09:38,021 --> 02:09:38,980
Get back!

1584
02:09:42,734 --> 02:09:43,860
Tommy!

1585
02:09:43,943 --> 02:09:45,445
-Can we get out?
-It's hopeless that way.

1586
02:09:45,778 --> 02:09:47,197
Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast.

1587
02:09:47,822 --> 02:09:48,823
Jack!

1588
02:09:49,449 --> 02:09:50,450
Fabrizio!

1589
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:52,368
The boats are all going.

1590
02:09:52,702 --> 02:09:54,454
This whole place is flooding.
We've gotta get out of here.

1591
02:09:54,621 --> 02:09:56,289
-There is <i>niente</i> this way.
-All right.

1592
02:09:56,789 --> 02:09:58,333
Let's go this way, all right? Come on!

1593
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:05,298
I make my own luck.

1594
02:10:05,632 --> 02:10:07,133
So do I.

1595
02:10:15,016 --> 02:10:16,351
Come on!

1596
02:10:16,851 --> 02:10:17,894
No, come on, let's go this way.

1597
02:10:27,403 --> 02:10:28,571
This way!

1598
02:10:29,447 --> 02:10:33,284
Just go back to the main stairwell.
And everything will be sorted out there.

1599
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:36,579
It will all get sorted out back there.

1600
02:10:36,955 --> 02:10:38,081
Go back to the main stairwell.

1601
02:10:38,206 --> 02:10:40,166
-Open the gate!
-Go back down the main stairwell.

1602
02:10:40,416 --> 02:10:41,751
Open the gate right now!

1603
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:43,920
Go back down the main
stairwell, like I told you.

1604
02:10:46,339 --> 02:10:48,841
God damn it! Son of a bitch!

1605
02:10:49,175 --> 02:10:50,176
Stop that!

1606
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:51,469
Open the damn gate!

1607
02:10:51,553 --> 02:10:52,679
Open it!

1608
02:10:55,265 --> 02:10:58,101
-Fabri, Tommy, give me a hand here.
-Move aside. Move aside!

1609
02:10:58,184 --> 02:10:59,185
Come on, pull!

1610
02:11:00,061 --> 02:11:01,062
Pull!

1611
02:11:02,021 --> 02:11:03,314
Move aside. Quickly, move aside!

1612
02:11:03,439 --> 02:11:04,440
Put that down!

1613
02:11:04,524 --> 02:11:05,775
-Move aside!
-Put that down!

1614
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:08,027
-One! Two!
-Stop that!

1615
02:11:08,111 --> 02:11:09,279
Three!

1616
02:11:11,531 --> 02:11:12,699
Again!

1617
02:11:14,701 --> 02:11:15,743
Now, let's go!

1618
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:19,122
Let's go, Rose.

1619
02:11:19,205 --> 02:11:21,374
You can't go up there! You can't do this!

1620
02:11:27,714 --> 02:11:29,549
Keep order! Keep order here!

1621
02:11:29,882 --> 02:11:32,719
Back! Back! Back!

1622
02:11:37,348 --> 02:11:38,349
Hold on to her!

1623
02:11:39,934 --> 02:11:40,977
Pull her in!

1624
02:11:41,936 --> 02:11:46,941
Get back, I say,
or I'll shoot you all like dogs!

1625
02:11:47,025 --> 02:11:48,443
Keep order here!

1626
02:11:49,736 --> 02:11:51,904
Keep order, I say.

1627
02:11:52,739 --> 02:11:54,907
Mr. Lowe, man this boat.

1628
02:11:59,412 --> 02:12:03,458
Right. Is everybody all right?
Nobody panic.

1629
02:12:09,756 --> 02:12:11,424
Stay back.

1630
02:12:11,924 --> 02:12:13,092
We're too late.

1631
02:12:13,343 --> 02:12:16,429
There are more boats down the front.
Stay with this one. Murdoch.

1632
02:12:16,679 --> 02:12:18,264
He seems to be quite practical.

1633
02:12:22,977 --> 02:12:24,479
Don't lower it!

1634
02:12:24,979 --> 02:12:26,939
Cut the falls!

1635
02:12:32,445 --> 02:12:34,280
Sit down!

1636
02:12:35,615 --> 02:12:37,033
Stay back, you lot!

1637
02:12:37,283 --> 02:12:40,453
Just stay back, the lot of you! Stay back!

1638
02:12:43,122 --> 02:12:45,792
It's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1639
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:48,795
Mr. Murdoch?

1640
02:12:49,128 --> 02:12:51,631
Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now!

1641
02:12:51,881 --> 02:12:53,466
I'm a businessman, as you know,

1642
02:12:53,633 --> 02:12:55,218
and I have a business proposition for you.

1643
02:13:03,017 --> 02:13:04,185
Come on, Rose.

1644
02:13:07,647 --> 02:13:08,731
The boats are gone!

1645
02:13:14,487 --> 02:13:16,155
Colonel, are there any boats on that side?

1646
02:13:16,239 --> 02:13:18,616
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1647
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:20,284
This way, I'll lead you.

1648
02:13:26,582 --> 02:13:29,961
What's the use?
Nobody's listening to us anyway.

1649
02:13:30,044 --> 02:13:31,713
Well, they don't listen to us
at dinner, either.

1650
02:13:31,838 --> 02:13:32,922
Come on, let's play.

1651
02:13:33,047 --> 02:13:34,382
Keep us warm.

1652
02:13:35,174 --> 02:13:36,509
"Orpheus."

1653
02:13:41,389 --> 02:13:44,183
Music to drown by.
Now I know I'm in first class.

1654
02:13:49,772 --> 02:13:52,859
-Where is everyone?
-They're all still aft, sir.

1655
02:13:55,361 --> 02:13:57,530
We have an understanding
then, Mr. Murdoch.

1656
02:14:08,875 --> 02:14:12,879
Will the men please hold back!
Hold back, I say!

1657
02:14:15,214 --> 02:14:18,009
Women and children only!

1658
02:14:18,176 --> 02:14:20,094
Get back!

1659
02:14:20,178 --> 02:14:23,097
Come through, madam.
This way. Step back, sir!

1660
02:14:24,599 --> 02:14:27,435
You better check the other side. Go!

1661
02:14:34,734 --> 02:14:36,569
I found her, on the other side.

1662
02:14:37,236 --> 02:14:38,654
Waiting for a boat.

1663
02:14:39,155 --> 02:14:40,156
With him.

1664
02:14:41,824 --> 02:14:43,910
-Any more women and children?
-They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch.

1665
02:14:44,243 --> 02:14:46,078
Anyone else then?

1666
02:14:47,663 --> 02:14:49,081
-Anyone else?
-Do hurry. Hurry along.

1667
02:14:55,254 --> 02:14:57,256
God damn it all to hell.

1668
02:14:59,926 --> 02:15:01,260
Shit.

1669
02:15:01,552 --> 02:15:02,553
Fire!

1670
02:15:03,137 --> 02:15:05,932
Sir, sir, you can't go through here.

1671
02:15:09,560 --> 02:15:11,896
That's it. Splendid. Right.

1672
02:15:15,775 --> 02:15:17,443
Prepare to lower.

1673
02:15:19,612 --> 02:15:21,447
Ready on the left.

1674
02:15:27,370 --> 02:15:29,038
Take them down.

1675
02:15:33,876 --> 02:15:35,211
Keep it steady.

1676
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:41,801
Both sides together.
Steady. Keep it steady.

1677
02:15:42,844 --> 02:15:44,178
-Give her to me.
-Daddy.

1678
02:15:45,012 --> 02:15:47,390
It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry.

1679
02:15:47,723 --> 02:15:49,392
Daddy, get in the boat.

1680
02:15:49,725 --> 02:15:52,770
It's good-bye for a little
while. Only for a little while.

1681
02:15:52,854 --> 02:15:54,814
There'll be another boat for the daddies.

1682
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:56,607
This boat is for the
mummies and the children.

1683
02:15:56,691 --> 02:15:58,776
You hold Mummy's hand
and be a good little girl.

1684
02:16:00,278 --> 02:16:01,612
I'm not going without you.

1685
02:16:01,863 --> 02:16:03,364
No, you have to go, now.

1686
02:16:03,531 --> 02:16:04,532
No, Jack.

1687
02:16:04,657 --> 02:16:06,242
Get in the boat, Rose.

1688
02:16:06,325 --> 02:16:08,286
-No, Jack.
-Yes.

1689
02:16:08,369 --> 02:16:09,370
Get on the boat!

1690
02:16:09,453 --> 02:16:11,789
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1691
02:16:14,625 --> 02:16:15,918
Oh, my God, look at you.

1692
02:16:16,002 --> 02:16:17,295
You look a fright.

1693
02:16:17,962 --> 02:16:18,963
Here.

1694
02:16:20,715 --> 02:16:22,884
Put this on. Come.

1695
02:16:28,222 --> 02:16:30,016
Go on. I'll get the next one.

1696
02:16:30,224 --> 02:16:32,184
No, not without you.

1697
02:16:32,268 --> 02:16:34,312
I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine.

1698
02:16:34,395 --> 02:16:36,439
I'm a survivor, all right?
Don't worry about me.

1699
02:16:36,522 --> 02:16:38,149
Now, go on. Get on.

1700
02:16:38,232 --> 02:16:40,067
I have an arrangement with an
officer on the other side of the ship.

1701
02:16:40,443 --> 02:16:41,986
Jack and I can get off safely.

1702
02:16:42,403 --> 02:16:43,404
Both of us.

1703
02:16:44,572 --> 02:16:45,656
See?

1704
02:16:45,740 --> 02:16:47,491
I got my own boat to catch.

1705
02:16:47,575 --> 02:16:48,659
Go on, hurry.

1706
02:16:48,743 --> 02:16:50,077
They're almost full.

1707
02:16:51,787 --> 02:16:53,456
-Step aboard, miss.
-Go. Go.

1708
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:55,958
Step aboard, please.

1709
02:16:56,042 --> 02:16:57,668
You're daddy's good girl, all right?

1710
02:16:57,752 --> 02:16:58,753
You're my little sailor.

1711
02:16:58,836 --> 02:17:00,755
Keep back. Keep back, I say.

1712
02:17:02,924 --> 02:17:03,925
Clear the rail, please.

1713
02:17:05,009 --> 02:17:06,677
And, lower away!

1714
02:17:20,691 --> 02:17:21,859
You're a good liar.

1715
02:17:22,777 --> 02:17:24,612
Almost as good as you.

1716
02:17:29,283 --> 02:17:32,703
There's no arrangement, is there?

1717
02:17:34,288 --> 02:17:35,790
No, there is.

1718
02:17:36,123 --> 02:17:38,292
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1719
02:17:40,211 --> 02:17:41,879
I always win, Jack.

1720
02:17:42,964 --> 02:17:44,632
One way or another.

1721
02:18:42,523 --> 02:18:43,524
Rose!

1722
02:18:46,027 --> 02:18:49,238
-Stop her! Stop her!
-Rose, what are you doing?

1723
02:18:50,823 --> 02:18:51,824
No!

1724
02:19:10,259 --> 02:19:11,552
Rose!

1725
02:19:14,847 --> 02:19:17,892
You're so stupid! Why did you do that?

1726
02:19:17,975 --> 02:19:19,602
You're so stupid, Rose.

1727
02:19:21,562 --> 02:19:23,189
Why did you do that? Why?

1728
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:26,400
You jump, I jump, right?

1729
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,361
Right.

1730
02:19:31,572 --> 02:19:33,908
Oh God. I couldn't go.

1731
02:19:33,991 --> 02:19:35,493
I couldn't go, Jack.

1732
02:19:35,576 --> 02:19:37,286
It's all right. We'll think of something.

1733
02:19:39,163 --> 02:19:41,415
-At least I'm with you.
-We'll think of something.

1734
02:19:55,805 --> 02:19:56,847
Come on! Move!

1735
02:19:59,642 --> 02:20:00,643
Come on! Move.

1736
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:08,400
Come on!

1737
02:20:16,575 --> 02:20:17,576
Move!

1738
02:20:23,958 --> 02:20:24,959
Come on! Come on, Rose.

1739
02:20:27,962 --> 02:20:28,963
Rose, come on!

1740
02:20:31,841 --> 02:20:32,842
Move Rose!

1741
02:20:36,387 --> 02:20:37,429
Go!

1742
02:20:48,023 --> 02:20:50,067
I hope you enjoy your time together!

1743
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:06,333
What could possibly be funny?

1744
02:21:07,334 --> 02:21:09,503
I put the diamond in the coat.

1745
02:21:12,631 --> 02:21:14,925
And I put the coat on her!

1746
02:21:16,260 --> 02:21:17,761
Come on!

1747
02:21:36,906 --> 02:21:39,450
Dada!

1748
02:21:40,618 --> 02:21:41,702
Dada!

1749
02:21:41,785 --> 02:21:42,912
We can't leave him.

1750
02:21:47,208 --> 02:21:48,792
All right, come on!

1751
02:21:50,294 --> 02:21:52,338
Dada!

1752
02:22:05,476 --> 02:22:06,810
Go back!

1753
02:22:17,488 --> 02:22:18,489
It's the wrong way! Come back!

1754
02:22:18,572 --> 02:22:20,908
No, not that way! Come back! Stop!

1755
02:22:26,372 --> 02:22:27,539
Go!

1756
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:33,420
Go! Run!

1757
02:22:59,238 --> 02:23:00,239
This way!

1758
02:23:12,418 --> 02:23:13,419
Give me your hand!

1759
02:23:22,594 --> 02:23:23,595
Oh, God!/

1760
02:23:28,309 --> 02:23:29,310
Help!

1761
02:23:35,274 --> 02:23:36,525
Help!

1762
02:23:38,068 --> 02:23:40,779
Wait, sir! Sir, open the gate, please!

1763
02:23:40,863 --> 02:23:42,031
Help us, please!

1764
02:23:42,448 --> 02:23:43,615
Help us!

1765
02:23:43,699 --> 02:23:44,867
-Please!
-Please!

1766
02:23:46,535 --> 02:23:47,578
Bloody hell!

1767
02:23:53,625 --> 02:23:55,627
-Come on, come on!
-Come on!

1768
02:23:55,961 --> 02:23:58,005
-Go, go!
-Jesus.

1769
02:23:59,131 --> 02:24:00,549
-Please!
-Come on!

1770
02:24:00,632 --> 02:24:01,633
Hurry!

1771
02:24:02,593 --> 02:24:03,594
Come on!

1772
02:24:08,682 --> 02:24:10,392
I'm sorry, I dropped the keys.

1773
02:24:11,518 --> 02:24:13,145
-Wait, please!
-Wait!

1774
02:24:13,896 --> 02:24:16,648
Don't leave! Please, send for help!

1775
02:24:35,334 --> 02:24:37,336
I got it! Which one is it, Rose?

1776
02:24:37,669 --> 02:24:39,421
The short one. Try the short one.

1777
02:24:40,589 --> 02:24:41,590
Hurry, Jack.

1778
02:24:45,344 --> 02:24:47,012
Oh no! It won't go in.

1779
02:24:47,888 --> 02:24:48,889
Hurry, Jack.

1780
02:24:51,475 --> 02:24:53,394
It's stuck! It's stuck!

1781
02:24:54,645 --> 02:24:56,271
-Come on!
-Hurry, Jack!

1782
02:24:57,940 --> 02:24:59,608
-Hurry, Jack!
-Come on!

1783
02:25:02,277 --> 02:25:04,279
I got it! I got it! Go! Go, Rose!

1784
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:06,615
Go! Go!

1785
02:25:18,961 --> 02:25:21,296
Jack! Come on!

1786
02:25:23,298 --> 02:25:24,800
Move, move.

1787
02:25:34,685 --> 02:25:37,062
-Get those oars in place.
-Get an oar under it.

1788
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:43,569
Hold it! Hold it!

1789
02:25:43,652 --> 02:25:44,987
Hold it!

1790
02:25:54,913 --> 02:25:59,168
Get these davits cranked in!
Let's get the falls hooked up!

1791
02:26:11,388 --> 02:26:13,223
Mommy!

1792
02:26:19,855 --> 02:26:20,939
Keep going up!

1793
02:26:24,193 --> 02:26:25,694
Stop pushing!

1794
02:26:27,863 --> 02:26:29,281
Stay back!

1795
02:26:29,364 --> 02:26:32,034
Will you give us a chance
to live, you limey bastard!

1796
02:26:32,117 --> 02:26:34,703
I'll shoot any man who tries
to get past me! Get back!

1797
02:26:34,786 --> 02:26:35,871
Bastard!

1798
02:26:35,954 --> 02:26:37,456
Get back!

1799
02:26:37,873 --> 02:26:38,957
We had a deal, damn you!

1800
02:26:42,377 --> 02:26:45,380
Your money can't save you
any more than it could save me.

1801
02:26:45,506 --> 02:26:46,507
Get back!

1802
02:26:47,716 --> 02:26:49,468
Women and children only!

1803
02:26:58,602 --> 02:26:59,937
No, Tommy!

1804
02:27:18,789 --> 02:27:19,790
No, Will!

1805
02:27:26,129 --> 02:27:28,048
Now stand back, damn you!

1806
02:27:30,676 --> 02:27:34,888
Gently, gently. Hold it. Hold it.

1807
02:27:44,523 --> 02:27:46,191
I have a child!

1808
02:27:46,525 --> 02:27:48,610
-I have a child!
-Clear a path here!

1809
02:27:49,027 --> 02:27:51,029
Please, I have a child!

1810
02:27:51,863 --> 02:27:54,241
Please. I'm all she has in the world.

1811
02:27:55,450 --> 02:27:56,535
Go on.

1812
02:27:56,868 --> 02:27:58,287
Step back!

1813
02:27:58,370 --> 02:28:00,163
-Please?
-Here, give her to me.

1814
02:28:00,414 --> 02:28:01,832
You're all right, dearie.

1815
02:28:04,918 --> 02:28:05,961
Give her here.

1816
02:28:07,921 --> 02:28:08,922
There, there.

1817
02:28:13,218 --> 02:28:16,096
Wait, wait, wait! Mr. Andrews!

1818
02:28:18,599 --> 02:28:19,600
Oh, Rose.

1819
02:28:22,603 --> 02:28:23,937
Won't you even make a try for it?

1820
02:28:25,897 --> 02:28:30,402
I'm sorry that I didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1821
02:28:32,237 --> 02:28:34,573
It's going fast. We have to move.

1822
02:28:34,656 --> 02:28:35,657
Wait.

1823
02:28:38,910 --> 02:28:40,329
Good luck to you, Rose.

1824
02:28:42,414 --> 02:28:43,415
And to you.

1825
02:28:56,470 --> 02:28:57,929
Mr. Guggenheim?

1826
02:28:58,013 --> 02:28:59,222
These are for you, Mr. Guggenheim.

1827
02:28:59,306 --> 02:29:00,307
No, thank you.

1828
02:29:00,474 --> 02:29:04,353
We are dressed in our best and are
prepared to go down as gentlemen.

1829
02:29:05,145 --> 02:29:07,064
But we would like a brandy.

1830
02:29:07,773 --> 02:29:10,275
Get the falls over here now!

1831
02:29:10,942 --> 02:29:13,403
Let them drop. Then we'll right it.

1832
02:29:20,827 --> 02:29:22,704
Where should I go? Please.

1833
02:29:28,877 --> 02:29:31,630
Captain. Captain. Sir.

1834
02:30:02,411 --> 02:30:04,287
Right. That's it, then.

1835
02:30:05,497 --> 02:30:07,124
Good-bye, Wally. Good luck.

1836
02:30:08,166 --> 02:30:09,334
-Good-bye, Wallace.
-So long, old chap.

1837
02:31:24,576 --> 02:31:29,080
And so they lived happily
together for 300 years

1838
02:31:29,414 --> 02:31:31,583
in the land of Tir na nog.

1839
02:31:32,584 --> 02:31:35,253
Land of eternal youth and beauty.

1840
02:32:10,622 --> 02:32:11,957
There's no time!

1841
02:32:12,415 --> 02:32:13,625
Cut those falls!

1842
02:32:13,708 --> 02:32:15,877
Cut them! Cut them if you have to!

1843
02:32:16,628 --> 02:32:19,297
I need a knife!

1844
02:32:20,966 --> 02:32:22,634
Cut the falls now!

1845
02:32:23,218 --> 02:32:24,302
Cut them loose!

1846
02:32:35,146 --> 02:32:37,148
Cut those bloody falls!

1847
02:33:24,613 --> 02:33:25,947
Gentlemen,

1848
02:33:26,448 --> 02:33:28,783
it has been a privilege
playing with you tonight.

1849
02:34:29,970 --> 02:34:31,846
We have to stay on the ship
as long as possible.

1850
02:34:32,013 --> 02:34:33,014
Come on!

1851
02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:46,695
This way. Through the rail.

1852
02:34:48,989 --> 02:34:50,323
Come on, Rose.

1853
02:34:50,407 --> 02:34:51,408
Jump.

1854
02:34:53,994 --> 02:34:55,036
Come on.

1855
02:35:28,361 --> 02:35:29,696
I got you. Jump.

1856
02:35:32,574 --> 02:35:34,159
I've got you, miss.

1857
02:35:34,993 --> 02:35:36,202
-Jack!
-Rose.

1858
02:35:38,246 --> 02:35:39,414
Back!

1859
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:11,279
No! You'll swamp us!

1860
02:36:24,084 --> 02:36:27,128
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

1861
02:36:27,462 --> 02:36:30,256
You wanna walk a little faster
through that valley there?

1862
02:37:20,557 --> 02:37:22,100
Holy Mary, mother of God,

1863
02:37:22,183 --> 02:37:25,270
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1864
02:37:26,020 --> 02:37:27,105
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1865
02:37:27,188 --> 02:37:28,189
This way.

1866
02:37:38,449 --> 02:37:39,450
Come on!

1867
02:37:39,534 --> 02:37:40,535
Come on!

1868
02:37:50,211 --> 02:37:52,797
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth

1869
02:37:52,881 --> 02:37:56,384
for the first heaven and the first earth
had passed away,

1870
02:37:57,510 --> 02:37:59,053
and there was no more sea.

1871
02:38:05,602 --> 02:38:08,688
It'll be over soon.
It'll all be over soon.

1872
02:38:14,235 --> 02:38:15,862
And he shall dwell with them.

1873
02:38:15,945 --> 02:38:20,366
And they shall be his people
and God himself shall be with them

1874
02:38:20,491 --> 02:38:22,076
and be their God.

1875
02:38:22,869 --> 02:38:23,912
Jack,

1876
02:38:24,913 --> 02:38:26,915
this is where we first met.

1877
02:38:34,005 --> 02:38:37,217
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes,

1878
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:39,594
and there shall be no more death.

1879
02:38:40,094 --> 02:38:42,639
Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

1880
02:38:43,139 --> 02:38:45,642
Neither shall there be any more pain

1881
02:38:46,476 --> 02:38:49,270
for the former world has passed away.

1882
02:39:03,618 --> 02:39:05,954
Bloody pull faster! And pull!

1883
02:39:29,310 --> 02:39:30,520
Hang on, Miss Trudy!

1884
02:40:06,556 --> 02:40:08,057
Hold on real tight.

1885
02:40:25,533 --> 02:40:27,368
God Almighty.

1886
02:40:34,834 --> 02:40:37,378
Keep those breakers in! Keep them in!

1887
02:41:56,416 --> 02:41:57,792
We have to move!

1888
02:42:03,756 --> 02:42:05,550
-Give me your hand. I'll pull you over.
-I can't.

1889
02:42:05,633 --> 02:42:07,635
Come on! Give me your hand.

1890
02:42:10,179 --> 02:42:12,306
I've got you. I won't let go.

1891
02:42:12,390 --> 02:42:13,599
Come on, I've got you.

1892
02:42:25,027 --> 02:42:28,197
-What's happening, Jack?
-I don't know. I don't know.

1893
02:42:37,373 --> 02:42:38,374
Hold on.

1894
02:43:20,708 --> 02:43:21,876
This is it!

1895
02:43:34,555 --> 02:43:38,226
Oh, my God, Jack! Oh, God. Oh, God.

1896
02:43:38,309 --> 02:43:39,644
Hold on!

1897
02:43:54,408 --> 02:43:56,827
The ship is gonna suck us down.

1898
02:43:56,911 --> 02:43:58,663
Take a deep breath when I say.

1899
02:44:04,418 --> 02:44:06,254
Kick for the surface and keep kicking.

1900
02:44:06,671 --> 02:44:08,214
Do not let go of my hand.

1901
02:44:15,763 --> 02:44:16,806
We're going to make it, Rose.

1902
02:44:16,889 --> 02:44:18,307
Trust me.

1903
02:44:18,391 --> 02:44:19,392
I trust you.

1904
02:44:24,438 --> 02:44:26,440
Ready! Ready!

1905
02:44:26,941 --> 02:44:27,942
Now!

1906
02:45:04,353 --> 02:45:06,063
Jack! Jack!

1907
02:45:06,856 --> 02:45:07,940
Jack!

1908
02:45:10,109 --> 02:45:11,110
Jack!

1909
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:17,241
Jack!

1910
02:45:37,970 --> 02:45:39,764
Jack! Jack!

1911
02:45:47,521 --> 02:45:48,648
Jack!

1912
02:45:49,190 --> 02:45:50,191
Rose!

1913
02:45:50,691 --> 02:45:52,401
Get off her! Get off her!

1914
02:45:56,030 --> 02:45:57,198
-Rose!
-Jack!

1915
02:45:57,281 --> 02:45:59,283
Swim, Rose! I need you to swim!

1916
02:46:03,704 --> 02:46:04,747
Keep swimming.

1917
02:46:09,043 --> 02:46:10,378
It's so cold.

1918
02:46:10,461 --> 02:46:11,796
Swim, Rose!

1919
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:19,053
Come on. Here.

1920
02:46:19,929 --> 02:46:20,971
Keep swimming.

1921
02:46:21,055 --> 02:46:22,390
Come on.

1922
02:46:24,558 --> 02:46:25,643
Here,

1923
02:46:25,726 --> 02:46:26,894
get on it.

1924
02:46:27,603 --> 02:46:29,105
Get on top.

1925
02:46:36,487 --> 02:46:37,905
Come on, Rose.

1926
02:46:47,498 --> 02:46:49,166
Stay on it. Stay on, Rose.

1927
02:47:11,021 --> 02:47:12,523
It'll be all right now.

1928
02:47:15,025 --> 02:47:16,527
It'll be all right now.

1929
02:47:23,909 --> 02:47:26,912
Return the boats!

1930
02:47:31,041 --> 02:47:33,127
The boats are coming back for us Rose.

1931
02:47:33,711 --> 02:47:35,379
Hold on just a little bit longer.

1932
02:47:36,046 --> 02:47:38,716
They had to row away for the suction,

1933
02:47:38,924 --> 02:47:41,093
but now they'll be coming back.

1934
02:47:44,263 --> 02:47:45,598
For God's sake!

1935
02:47:45,681 --> 02:47:48,392
Please, help us!

1936
02:47:53,898 --> 02:47:55,608
You don't understand.

1937
02:47:56,442 --> 02:47:58,819
If we go back, they'll swamp the boat.

1938
02:47:58,903 --> 02:48:00,279
They'll pull us right down,
I'm telling you.

1939
02:48:00,738 --> 02:48:03,240
Knock it off. You're scaring me.

1940
02:48:03,699 --> 02:48:06,368
Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go.

1941
02:48:06,452 --> 02:48:09,622
Are you out of your mind?
We're in the middle of the North Atlantic.

1942
02:48:09,914 --> 02:48:13,250
Now, do you people want to live
or do you want to die?

1943
02:48:20,007 --> 02:48:22,259
I don't understand a one of you.

1944
02:48:24,220 --> 02:48:25,721
What's the matter with you?

1945
02:48:25,805 --> 02:48:27,681
It's your men out there!

1946
02:48:30,518 --> 02:48:32,144
There's plenty of room for more.

1947
02:48:32,228 --> 02:48:33,729
And there'll be one less on this boat

1948
02:48:34,063 --> 02:48:37,441
if you don't shut that hole in your face!

1949
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:57,378
Now, bring in your oars over there.
And tie these two boats together as well.

1950
02:49:01,799 --> 02:49:04,134
Now, make sure that's
tied up nice and tight.

1951
02:49:07,847 --> 02:49:10,641
Right, listen to me, men.
We have to go back.

1952
02:49:10,724 --> 02:49:14,186
I want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat right now,

1953
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:15,437
as quick as you can, please.

1954
02:49:15,521 --> 02:49:17,982
Let's create some space over there.
Move forward and aft.

1955
02:49:27,992 --> 02:49:29,827
It's getting quiet.

1956
02:49:31,996 --> 02:49:35,332
It's just going to take
a couple of minutes

1957
02:49:35,416 --> 02:49:37,418
to get the boats organized.

1958
02:49:40,671 --> 02:49:42,339
I don't know about you but

1959
02:49:42,673 --> 02:49:46,427
I intend to write a strongly worded letter

1960
02:49:46,510 --> 02:49:48,304
to the White Star Line about all this.

1961
02:49:56,562 --> 02:49:58,188
I love you, Jack.

1962
02:50:04,862 --> 02:50:06,363
Don't you do that.

1963
02:50:07,865 --> 02:50:11,160
Don't you say your good-byes. Not yet.

1964
02:50:11,243 --> 02:50:12,870
Do you understand me?

1965
02:50:13,203 --> 02:50:15,039
I'm so cold.

1966
02:50:15,539 --> 02:50:17,041
Listen, Rose,

1967
02:50:18,208 --> 02:50:19,877
you're gonna get out of here.

1968
02:50:21,045 --> 02:50:22,546
You're gonna go on,

1969
02:50:23,881 --> 02:50:25,633
and you're gonna make lots of babies.

1970
02:50:26,383 --> 02:50:28,385
And you're gonna watch them grow.

1971
02:50:30,095 --> 02:50:31,347
You're gonna die an old...

1972
02:50:31,430 --> 02:50:32,848
An old lady.

1973
02:50:32,932 --> 02:50:34,600
Warm in her bed.

1974
02:50:36,268 --> 02:50:37,353
Not here.

1975
02:50:38,270 --> 02:50:40,981
Not this night. Not like this.

1976
02:50:41,065 --> 02:50:42,733
Do you understand me?

1977
02:50:45,736 --> 02:50:47,905
I can't feel my body.

1978
02:50:49,573 --> 02:50:51,033
Winning that ticket, Rose,

1979
02:50:51,158 --> 02:50:53,786
was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

1980
02:50:55,412 --> 02:50:57,247
It brought me to you.

1981
02:50:58,874 --> 02:51:01,293
And I'm thankful for that, Rose.

1982
02:51:01,877 --> 02:51:03,212
I'm thankful.

1983
02:51:06,632 --> 02:51:07,758
You must...

1984
02:51:08,884 --> 02:51:10,928
You must do me this honor.

1985
02:51:13,931 --> 02:51:17,434
You must promise me that you'll survive.

1986
02:51:18,686 --> 02:51:20,980
That you won't give up,

1987
02:51:22,231 --> 02:51:24,233
no matter what happens.

1988
02:51:26,902 --> 02:51:29,238
No matter how hopeless.

1989
02:51:32,408 --> 02:51:34,576
Promise me now, Rose.

1990
02:51:36,745 --> 02:51:39,081
And never let go of that promise.

1991
02:51:40,749 --> 02:51:42,084
I promise.

1992
02:51:44,169 --> 02:51:45,838
Never let go.

1993
02:51:48,757 --> 02:51:50,843
I'll never let go, Jack.

1994
02:51:53,637 --> 02:51:55,305
I'll never let go.

1995
02:52:19,371 --> 02:52:20,873
Right ahead, sir.

1996
02:52:24,043 --> 02:52:25,544
Oars!

1997
02:52:26,211 --> 02:52:27,713
Do you see any moving?

1998
02:52:28,714 --> 02:52:30,841
No, sir. None moving, sir.

1999
02:52:31,216 --> 02:52:32,551
Check them.

2000
02:52:32,885 --> 02:52:34,428
Bring that oar up here.

2001
02:52:41,101 --> 02:52:42,644
Check them. Make sure.

2002
02:52:43,520 --> 02:52:45,064
These are dead, sir.

2003
02:52:45,564 --> 02:52:46,732
Now, give way.

2004
02:52:47,232 --> 02:52:48,233
Ahead easy.

2005
02:52:55,074 --> 02:52:56,575
Careful with your oars.

2006
02:52:57,159 --> 02:52:58,202
Don't hit them.

2007
02:53:00,746 --> 02:53:03,082
Is there anyone alive out there?

2008
02:53:04,583 --> 02:53:06,418
Can anyone hear me?

2009
02:53:08,587 --> 02:53:10,923
Is there anyone alive out there?

2010
02:53:17,805 --> 02:53:19,223
We waited too long.

2011
02:53:23,435 --> 02:53:24,895
Well, keep checking them!

2012
02:53:24,978 --> 02:53:26,438
Keep looking!

2013
02:53:27,272 --> 02:53:29,775
Is there anyone alive out there?

2014
02:53:33,278 --> 02:53:35,280
Can anyone hear me?

2015
02:53:46,458 --> 02:53:49,294
 <i>Come, Josephine</i> 

2016
02:53:49,628 --> 02:53:54,299
 <i>In my flying machine</i> 

2017
02:53:55,467 --> 02:53:59,012
 <i>And it's up she goes</i> 

2018
02:54:00,806 --> 02:54:03,433
 <i>Up she goes</i> 

2019
02:54:08,188 --> 02:54:10,649
 <i>Come, Josephine</i> 

2020
02:54:12,985 --> 02:54:15,320
 <i>In my flying</i> 

2021
02:54:39,219 --> 02:54:40,554
Jack.

2022
02:54:58,655 --> 02:54:59,990
Jack.

2023
02:55:00,199 --> 02:55:01,533
There's a boat.

2024
02:55:02,284 --> 02:55:03,410
Jack.

2025
02:55:14,713 --> 02:55:16,048
Jack.

2026
02:55:16,965 --> 02:55:18,175
Jack.

2027
02:55:20,177 --> 02:55:21,261
Jack.

2028
02:55:24,806 --> 02:55:25,807
Jack.

2029
02:55:28,602 --> 02:55:30,604
There's a boat, Jack.

2030
02:55:33,523 --> 02:55:34,524
Jack.

2031
02:56:14,273 --> 02:56:15,607
Come back.

2032
02:56:16,775 --> 02:56:18,277
Come back.

2033
02:56:20,570 --> 02:56:21,780
Come back.

2034
02:56:22,948 --> 02:56:24,449
Come back.

2035
02:56:25,284 --> 02:56:26,785
Come back.

2036
02:56:27,619 --> 02:56:29,955
Come back. Come back!

2037
02:56:31,623 --> 02:56:33,125
Hello!

2038
02:56:34,918 --> 02:56:36,795
Can anyone hear me?

2039
02:56:37,462 --> 02:56:39,131
There's nothing here, sir.

2040
02:56:41,758 --> 02:56:42,968
Come back.

2041
02:56:44,469 --> 02:56:45,846
Come back.

2042
02:56:53,687 --> 02:56:55,147
I'll never let go.

2043
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:56,732
I promise.

2044
02:57:39,816 --> 02:57:41,651
Come about!

2045
02:58:03,006 --> 02:58:06,843
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea

2046
02:58:07,177 --> 02:58:10,222
when <i>Titanic </i>sank from under us.

2047
02:58:12,057 --> 02:58:15,227
There were twenty boats floating nearby,

2048
02:58:16,395 --> 02:58:18,688
and only one came back.

2049
02:58:20,524 --> 02:58:21,608
One.

2050
02:58:23,360 --> 02:58:26,029
Six were saved from the water,

2051
02:58:26,530 --> 02:58:28,198
myself included.

2052
02:58:29,366 --> 02:58:30,659
Six,

2053
02:58:31,868 --> 02:58:33,912
out of fifteen hundred.

2054
02:58:37,040 --> 02:58:38,375
Afterward,

2055
02:58:39,543 --> 02:58:41,545
the seven hundred people in the boats

2056
02:58:42,295 --> 02:58:44,423
had nothing to do but wait.

2057
02:58:46,049 --> 02:58:47,717
Wait to die.

2058
02:58:48,218 --> 02:58:49,761
Wait to live.

2059
02:58:50,929 --> 02:58:53,098
Wait for an absolution

2060
02:58:53,598 --> 02:58:55,434
that would never come.

2061
02:59:59,623 --> 03:00:02,042
Sir, I don't think you'll find any
of your people down here.

2062
03:00:02,209 --> 03:00:03,668
It's all steerage.

2063
03:00:06,630 --> 03:00:10,175
His hair is reddish brown,
reddish brown, reddish brown.

2064
03:00:10,300 --> 03:00:11,676
White beard.

2065
03:00:12,135 --> 03:00:13,762
Isn't there another passenger list?

2066
03:00:13,845 --> 03:00:14,971
There is no other list.

2067
03:00:15,096 --> 03:00:16,556
Perhaps he's on another ship.

2068
03:00:16,848 --> 03:00:18,975
We're doing all we can, ma'am.
I'm so sorry.

2069
03:00:41,998 --> 03:00:44,668
 <i>That's the last time I ever saw him.</i> 

2070
03:00:45,168 --> 03:00:48,672
 <i>He married, of course,</i> 
 <i>and inherited his millions.</i> 

2071
03:00:49,339 --> 03:00:52,842
 <i>But the Crash of '29 </i> 
 <i>hit his interests hard,</i> 

2072
03:00:53,176 --> 03:00:55,595
 <i>and he put a pistol in</i> 
 <i>his mouth that year.</i> 

2073
03:00:56,054 --> 03:00:57,889
Or so I read.

2074
03:01:10,694 --> 03:01:12,112
Can I take your name please, love?

2075
03:01:15,198 --> 03:01:16,533
Dawson.

2076
03:01:18,702 --> 03:01:20,203
Rose Dawson.

2077
03:01:21,538 --> 03:01:22,706
Thank you.

2078
03:01:29,713 --> 03:01:31,798
We never found anything on Jack.

2079
03:01:32,007 --> 03:01:33,925
There's no record of him at all.

2080
03:01:34,551 --> 03:01:36,928
No, there wouldn't be, would there?

2081
03:01:37,262 --> 03:01:39,973
And I've never spoken of him until now.

2082
03:01:40,724 --> 03:01:42,100
Not to anyone.

2083
03:01:42,934 --> 03:01:44,936
Not even your grandfather.

2084
03:01:45,270 --> 03:01:49,232
A woman's heart is a
deep ocean of secrets.

2085
03:01:50,066 --> 03:01:53,737
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson,

2086
03:01:54,070 --> 03:01:56,072
and that he saved me

2087
03:01:56,406 --> 03:01:59,743
in every way that a person can be saved.

2088
03:02:01,745 --> 03:02:04,414
I don't even have a picture of him.

2089
03:02:06,916 --> 03:02:10,754
He exists now only in my memory.

2090
03:02:15,592 --> 03:02:19,137
Keldysh,<i> Mir 2 on our way to the surface.</i>

2091
03:02:35,612 --> 03:02:38,365
 <i>I was saving this for when</i> 
 <i>I found the diamond.</i> 

2092
03:02:47,791 --> 03:02:49,292
I'm sorry.

2093
03:02:51,961 --> 03:02:53,463
Three years

2094
03:02:54,130 --> 03:02:56,800
I've thought of nothing except <i>Titanic.</i>

2095
03:02:57,634 --> 03:02:59,469
But I never got it.

2096
03:03:02,597 --> 03:03:04,516
I never let it in.
