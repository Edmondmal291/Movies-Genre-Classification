1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,190
Master Yu... I beat Yim Chun-loi

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,396
I really did... I am not lying

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,515
Take me as your disciple

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,469
Get up

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,354
I saw it... sit down

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,112
lp Man, you are not afraid of hardship

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,992
You have the drive, you are smart

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,596
I'll be pleased to have you as my disciple

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,478
But you still have a test to pass

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,637
Master Yu, this is underhanded
You are right

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,270
What's the test?

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,993
I am going to teach you three moves

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,271
You have to use them to cut off a queue

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,553
A queue?

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,756
Watch carefully

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,798
That's it?
That's it

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,150
Oh no

18
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,154
Give way...

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,759
Give way...

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,109
Brother Ching-shan

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,709
You are going to a western country
Don't forget to write me

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,275
I'll let you know
Fu Hung-mo can't be more wrong

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,989
lp Man, what Fu Hung-mo told you
was not true

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,392
Britain has been the most powerful
country in the past 200 years

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,750
I am going there to find out
the meaning of revolution

26
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,269
I'll find out the meaning of
queue cutting

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,715
Brother Ching-shan

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,669
Truth will tell

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,155
What Fu Jing-wan said was all nonsense

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,990
Brother Ching-shan, don't you forget me
Don't you forget Sangyuan

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,313
Brother Ching-shan, bon voyage

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,517
Don't forget to write me

33
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,111
You have to write me... Brother Ching-shan

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,036
Who sent you here?

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,270
Why are you trying me out?

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,430
Tell me or you are dead!

37
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,637
Master Chan, you picked up
Wing Chun from Mr Tsan?

38
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,759
Mentor Yu

39
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,633
The queue, look

40
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,037
Really Cashier Wah's queue?

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,710
You cut it?

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,473
Yes, I cut it

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,752
Or he cut it himself?

44
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,349
You sure are smart, how did you know?

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,915
What happened?

46
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,238
I worked hard on the three moves
you taught me

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,952
I first used this move

48
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,916
Then this

49
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,519
Then this

50
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,114
I was this close to getting his queue, but...

51
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,318
You can't get my queue, just go back

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,239
I may not be able to cut it today

53
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,075
But I will if I come every day for a year

54
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,875
Please, what a pest you are

55
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,189
Alright, you win

56
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,152
You satisfied now?

57
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,872
Take it back to Master Yu

58
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,630
Mentor, take me as your disciple

59
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,998
I won't take you as my disciple

60
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,429
But I will teach you martial arts

61
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,314
Get up

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,033
No obeisance as a disciple

63
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,359
Mentor, why?

64
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,918
You know what Wing Chun is?

65
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,835
Wing Chun?

66
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,350
Boss Chan

67
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,318
Excuse me

68
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,714
What now?

69
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,269
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,435
Young Master...

71
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,589
Thank you, I have to run

72
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,274
Young Master...

73
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,073
Hey... your ticket

74
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,156
Sorry

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,477
Halt

76
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,756
Chun-loi, I am going to Canton
Don't get in my way

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,991
lp Man, don't you give me
a hard time again

78
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,871
What are you doing?

79
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,235
I've been given many a slapping
and made to kneel because of you

80
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,912
You mean it? We are brother

81
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,274
I am not your brother

82
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,835
Yim Chun-loi, you can't fight me

83
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,835
I've gotta get on board

84
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,954
lp Man... one day, you'll be the one
pushed into the water

85
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,438
Mentor, it's the Canton Martial
Arts Convention

86
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,755
How can you not take me with you?

87
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,473
How many times have I told you?

88
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,154
I'd teach you martial arts

89
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,994
I have not taken you in as my disciple
Don't call me mentor

90
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,876
Old habits die hard

91
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,716
I am sorry

92
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,439
Mentor, it's said martial arts practitioners
of the South will all attend the convention

93
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,994
Tip me off

94
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,920
The championship is yours to lose
Or is it within your reach?

95
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,876
I'm going there to watch and learn
not to fight

96
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,790
Mentor, with your cultivation

97
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,470
If you don't take part in the convention
the convention will be but a sham

98
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,269
There's always someone out there
who's better

99
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,029
Bear it in mind

100
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,831
A true martial arts adept doesn't
make his name in the ring

101
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,749
Then by what?

102
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,917
Generosity of the heart

103
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,119
Halt...

104
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,355
Bravo...

105
00:09:44,160 --> 00:10:00,236
A sound physique, a strong country

106
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,958
Don't run...

107
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,548
Halt...

108
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,075
Here he is...

109
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,555
General Wu, you are going to the frontline
What are the prospects ahead?

110
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,835
Usurpers are running amuck

111
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,028
The revolution may end in vain

112
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,630
It really hurts us to see it

113
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,154
I am going to the frontline

114
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,190
There are only two possible outcomes

115
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,232
Flowers for sale... fresh flowers for sale...

116
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,518
Either the revolution prevails in the end

117
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,910
Or I'll die for the revolution

118
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,471
Bravo...

119
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,471
Mentor, Canton really is different

120
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,397
Help...

121
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,953
Who gave you permission to sell here?

122
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,910
Please, don't stamp on my flowers

123
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,678
I need the money for my mom's medication

124
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,718
Please...

125
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,471
Mentor, just a moment

126
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,834
Go back with me and be my concubine

127
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,631
Then you'll have money for medication

128
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,477
Let go of her

129
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:25,997
What are you doing here?

130
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,717
You have to pay for her flowers

131
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,992
How does that concern you?

132
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,592
Indeed

133
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,715
Beat him up...
Bring it on...

134
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,676
All right

135
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,710
What are you doing?

136
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,751
Miss, don't worry

137
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,150
I am standing up for you
I'll bear the consequences

138
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,357
Stop it...

139
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,155
Mok's Family School

140
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,156
Hello folks, I am from Foshan...

141
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,510
What are you doing?

142
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,594
What's wrong with you?
Get up

143
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,910
Miss, what now?

144
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,033
Chivalry is not welcome here in Canton?

145
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,032
You really can't tell?

146
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,031
We are doing a modern play

147
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,357
What?

148
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,231
You can't tell it's acting?

149
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,038
Modern play?
Yes

150
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,955
It's acting, it's not real, it's a play

151
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,119
I really am sorry

152
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,235
It's my first time in Canton

153
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,956
I really am sorry...

154
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,876
Don't be such a fool next time

155
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,591
You guys alright?

156
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,918
This man...

157
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,957
No pictures...

158
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,351
Mentor, let's go

159
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,394
Modern play?

160
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,269
Mentor, could you tell?

161
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,798
Since you couldn't either, how could I?

162
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,189
This is not Foshan

163
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,514
We have to be more careful

164
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,788
Stay out of trouble

165
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,508
Take mine...

166
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,518
He's a cripple, it'll be
a bumpy ride for you

167
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,437
What nonsense

168
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,316
I dare you for a challenge

169
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,113
I'll put a bucket of water on my rickshaw

170
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,235
Not a drop of water will be spilled

171
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,196
I don't believe it

172
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,680
Well? Any spillage?

173
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,589
Any?

174
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,392
Not a drop of it!

175
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,835
Boss, take mine

176
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,549
Alright, guys

177
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,598
I'll take yours

178
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,393
Boss, his is all wet

179
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,479
Cripple, you'll see

180
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,629
Go!

181
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,553
Sir, how should I call you?

182
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,552
Zi

183
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,076
Zi, you speak with a Foshan accent

184
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,154
You have lived in Foshan before?

185
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,670
None of your business

186
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,714
Young man, you are competitive

187
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,432
The loser will go hungry

188
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,759
Mentor, you go in first

189
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,990
Let me call on a friend

190
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,349
This is not our hometown.
You be careful

191
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,516
I know

192
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,513
Zi, Taojin Street

193
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,430
Go!

194
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,033
Foshan Guild Hall

195
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,196
He's got nothing to do with it
Let him go

196
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,353
It's alright, I am an out-of-towner

197
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,635
I'd love some fun

198
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,875
Let me just watch from here

199
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,797
Zi, you know how many rickshaw
pullers are there in Canton?

200
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,393
Three thousand

201
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,068
Three thousand!

202
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,918
They are all my men

203
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,158
I have more men than the police force

204
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,910
I am somebody here

205
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,668
Brother Lo, save your effort
He's not giving you face

206
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,031
I hear that you won't pay your dues

207
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,111
What nerve

208
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,754
You don't mean to pay me your respect?

209
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,990
I make my own living with my own hands

210
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,514
What have you got to do with it?

211
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,233
I am somebody, I am not petty

212
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,834
Young man, listen very carefully

213
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,998
Pay your dues and keep a low profile

214
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,154
Then you can be a rickshaw puller, get it?

215
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,596
I make my own living with my own hands

216
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,312
Every copper belongs to me

217
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,229
Hands off my money

218
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,395
You...

219
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,153
Sit tight

220
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,429
Beat him up!

221
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,872
Try him out!
Chase...

222
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,431
Give way...

223
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,476
You stay out of it

224
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,711
But I am in it

225
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,269
It's not your concern

226
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,115
They hit me

227
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,271
Stay away and they'll leave you alone

228
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,030
But I am on your rickshaw

229
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,629
Not anymore

230
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,957
Alright

231
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,837
So?

232
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,991
Who is he?

233
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,076
The Crane School?

234
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,229
Come down

235
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,192
Hey, I've told you
This doesn't concern you

236
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,071
Hey, mind yourself

237
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,871
Does it hurt?

238
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,275
Halt! All halt!

239
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,995
Young man, your mentor is
Yu Fung-kau of the Crane School?

240
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,076
You know my mentor?

241
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,034
My pleasure

242
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,595
I have never met your mentor

243
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,634
But it'll be my honour to meet him

244
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,076
It's said he had a match with Wong Fei-hung

245
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,515
Young man, could you inform your mentor

246
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,714
That Brother Lo asks him to join him for
a drink at the Phoenix House this evening?

247
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,671
Thank you indeed

248
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:36,870
Let's go

249
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,276
Are you going?

250
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,390
Sure

251
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,637
You sure pull all stops

252
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,518
You may stand up to one

253
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,198
You may stand up to ten

254
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,429
You may stand up to a hundred

255
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,954
But can you stand up to a thousand?

256
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,955
The world is full of stray dogs
I am one of them

257
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,798
There's only one piece of bone
in the rubbish bin

258
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,156
If I don't take it, other dogs will

259
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,635
And they will come for me afterwards

260
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,634
I may get killed, but I'll try
to get them first

261
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,916
We may have to live like dogs
But we aren't dogs

262
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,838
You are human, you don't know dogs

263
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,510
Who was that Brother Lo?

264
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,719
Lap dog, Marshal Lo's

265
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,869
Marshal Lo? Lo Cheung-yee?

266
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,877
How come a martial arts practitioner
is linked to a warlord?

267
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,791
Here you are, just go over

268
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,799
Keep the change

269
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,032
I earn my own living with my own effort

270
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,957
Not from alms

271
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,634
How can I get in touch with you?

272
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,880
Isn't he the fool I met earlier?

273
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,870
Uncle... Yes?

274
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,398
You've come to the right person

275
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,669
Others can't do it for you

276
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,599
Just watch

277
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,359
Be careful...

278
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,832
You... alright?

279
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,031
I am fine...

280
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,631
But your suitcase...

281
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,029
Kid...

282
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,232
Hey...

283
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,274
Siu-lin, answer the door

284
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,111
Who do you want?

285
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,310
Cheung Wing-sing

286
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,510
Wing-sing

287
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,276
lp Man?

288
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,875
You sure look good

289
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,350
Good?

290
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,233
Wait till you see me at the gate of
the Forbidden City

291
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,431
After the northern expedition

292
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,510
Northern expedition?

293
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,795
So we are fighting up north?

294
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,229
It's confidential

295
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,231
I never thought you would join the army

296
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,235
You didn't see the warlords very highly

297
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,069
But I believe in Brother Ching-shan

298
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,915
Brother Ching-shan? Where's he?

299
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,079
He's now Deputy Chief Secretary
of the provincial government

300
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,311
It's he who convinced me to join the army

301
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,671
Let me take you to him sometime

302
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,754
I should have come earlier to see you guys

303
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,473
Oh yes, did you meet my sister
when you got in?

304
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,190
Your sister? Who's your sister?

305
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,395
My cousin

306
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,315
Her parents died early

307
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,919
She has been living with us

308
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,309
My dad is her paternal uncle

309
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,836
He sees her as his own daughter

310
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,469
Cousin?

311
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,112
Cheung Wing-shing?

312
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,430
Yes, you have forgotten about it?

313
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,876
We used to go play in your house
when we're small

314
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,310
Oi-dor, the Cheung family and the lp family
are in different fields

315
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,198
But we are equal in status

316
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,671
I do hope that we can be in-laws

317
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,676
What do you think?

318
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,469
Great, of course! We can't be happier

319
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,597
But... you are marrying down

320
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,552
Please don't say so

321
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,518
Good... so lp Man and
Miss Wing-shing are betrothed

322
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,675
It's a deal

323
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,994
lp Man... Ip Man?

324
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,950
Good

325
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,675
Good? About what?

326
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,472
Nothing...

327
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,518
You alright?

328
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,909
I am fine

329
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,791
You don't look right to me

330
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,828
Wing-sing, it's too loud

331
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,798
Dad, see who's here

332
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,558
Uncle...

333
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,509
Ip Man?

334
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,989
Come on over

335
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,790
Let me have a good look at you

336
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,076
Not bad at all

337
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,151
Oi-dor has raised up a fine man

338
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,718
Uncle, I got it from Dad that most
of your time has been spent overseas

339
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,436
But it's my first time in Canton

340
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,432
Even so, Dad and Mom were
reluctant to let me come

341
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,433
Uncle, you should talk them over

342
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,717
Tell them that a man has to see the world

343
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,797
You can't wait to enlist me
to your cause

344
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,559
Stay as long as you like in Canton

345
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,279
I'll tell your dad about it, alright?

346
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,794
Uncle, thank you

347
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,158
Where's Wing-shing?

348
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,556
She's with him again?

349
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,631
Dad, why are you prejudiced against him?

350
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,833
You and Wing-shing...
are too young to understand

351
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,034
lp Man, make yourself at home

352
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,599
Take care of him

353
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,749
I have to go back to my work

354
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,718
Please, don't let me get in your way
Alright

355
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,990
Him? Whom were you talking about?

356
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,510
Brother Ching-shan

357
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,871
He and Wing-shing were schoolmates overseas

358
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,553
How long will it take?

359
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,675
Lt'll soon be done

360
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,437
Dad, Mom, I can't be happier
with this betrothal

361
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,275
Ching-shan, how do I look?

362
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,638
Gorgeous

363
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,432
You will steal the limelight
tomorrow night

364
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,077
You two sure make a pretty pair
A match made in heaven

365
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,719
Tomorrow night, I'll have an
announcement to make

366
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,395
The alteration first

367
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,435
Sir, hello, it's for members only here

368
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,397
Members Only

369
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,154
Members only? What does that mean?

370
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,953
You can't go in unless you are a member

371
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,239
But you open your door for business

372
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,396
Sir, I am sorry

373
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,509
Sir, you can't go in...

374
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,072
Sir...

375
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,838
Wing-shing...

376
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,556
Excuse me... but where's the girl?
She's here not just now

377
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,396
She has left by that side

378
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,317
Sorry, Sir, you can't come in

379
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,039
Please leave here, sorry

380
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,874
This way please

381
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,637
You may disrupt our members

382
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,393
I am sorry...

383
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,757
Mentor

384
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,039
How come my suitcase is here?

385
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,717
I got it back for you

386
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,756
Why look so dejected?

387
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,150
Nothing

388
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,230
Oh yes, Mentor, do you know Brother Lo
of Shahe Gang?

389
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,077
He's well-known to everyone

390
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,511
That's good

391
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,990
He can't wait to meet you

392
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,036
He's inviting you for a drink this evening

393
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,831
I am not going

394
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,238
But why not?

395
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,792
You think it's just for a drink?

396
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,838
Shahe Gang has been tailing us
since we got off the boat

397
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,076
What?

398
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,228
So has the Mok's Family School

399
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,315
Mok's Family School?

400
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,349
Ching-shan, can this
Mok Yan-chiu beat Yu Fung-kau?

401
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,750
No

402
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,793
But you referred him to be our coach

403
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:07,308
Ching-shan, many warlords
have come to Canton

404
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,872
Our coach has to beat everyone else

405
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,439
This convention is not just
about martial arts

406
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,910
It's also a power contest amongst
the warlords

407
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,550
No wonder Zi called Brother Lo
Marshal Lo's dog

408
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,829
What about the Mok's Family School?

409
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,274
Marshal Chu's

410
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,636
Marshal Chu?

411
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,518
If I can't win, I'll have to step down

412
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,313
But Marshal, you will win

413
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,550
I have found you the right man

414
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,871
He stands head and shoulders above others

415
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,958
Who is he?

416
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,793
You can meet him tonight
the Foshan Hero, Yu Fung-kau

417
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,514
Good

418
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,997
Hence we have to be careful

419
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,234
Then should we go to Brother Ching-shan
to get the invitations to the convention?

420
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,877
Soldiers are not difficult to recruit
Money is not difficult to make

421
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,917
Firearms not difficult to get
Cannons not difficult to handle

422
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,433
But talents are hard to come by

423
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,833
You have to get him for me

424
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,076
Marshal, rest assured of that

425
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,952
Winner takes all, you will be the winner

426
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,674
The moment of truth is
in a couple of days

427
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,593
Very good

428
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,793
Guangdong Provincial Government

429
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,557
Who do you want?

430
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,590
Lam Ching-shan

431
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,751
Second floor, turn left

432
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,870
Thank you

433
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,317
So many rooms, which one?

434
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,916
Excuse me

435
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,476
Which one is Lam Ching-shan's room?

436
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,149
Down the corridor, the one on the left

437
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,312
Thank you
You're welcome

438
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,398
Sir, Miss Cheung's here

439
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,157
Alright

440
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,751
Sorry, Marshal wanted me
I couldn't go away

441
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,633
No need to apologise to me

442
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,189
You should apologise to yourself
and your ideals

443
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,152
What do you mean?

444
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,438
You are a man of ideals and aspirations

445
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,349
But you are here mapping out
strategies for Marshal Chu

446
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,232
To help him win the civil war

447
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,829
Even if he wins

448
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,433
Will it contribute to the revolution?

449
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,351
Hush

450
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,995
You do see it eye to eye with this
female reporter by the name of Ha Kui

451
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,799
Marshal Chu and Marshal Lo

452
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,999
One wears revolution on his lips
One wears interest on his lips

453
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,557
But they are two of a kind

454
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,715
We shouldn't trust such old school
warlords with our revolution

455
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,913
Which part of it is wrong?

456
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,515
Very insightful

457
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,916
Who do you want?

458
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,074
Where is Lam Ching-shan?

459
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,077
Inside

460
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,549
Thank you

461
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,998
Excuse me, where is Lam Ching-shan?

462
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,272
He's having a talk inside

463
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,120
Please wait over there
You will be notified

464
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,709
Secretary Li, you are wanted

465
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,874
Come try this firearm

466
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,791
What are you doing?

467
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,400
Come on, be still, aim, hold it tight

468
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,516
When the points are in line
pull the trigger

469
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,994
Stop kidding

470
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,832
Don't worry, it's not loaded, try it

471
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,839
Ready?

472
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,319
Hold it tight, aim, be still, aim

473
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,431
Now fire

474
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,750
Wing-shing

475
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,072
Chief Secretary Lam

476
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,437
It's alright, we were trying out
the firearm

477
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,314
Now you see how powerful it is?

478
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,196
It's loaded

479
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,232
Stop

480
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,150
Who are you?

481
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,677
Let me tell you

482
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,234
The magazine may be out

483
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,711
There's still one bullet in the bore

484
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,909
I can still kill you

485
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,592
Lam Ching-shan

486
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,233
What? You know each other?

487
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,310
We've met twice

488
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,429
Brother Ching-shan

489
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,313
You... Ip Man

490
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,756
Brother Ching-shan

491
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,629
You sure have grown up

492
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,237
I wouldn't recognise you if we
bumped into each other out on the street

493
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,310
You came to Canton alone?

494
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,995
I came with my mentor
for the martial arts convention

495
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,228
Master Yu Fung-kau

496
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,393
Master Yu, it's my honour
