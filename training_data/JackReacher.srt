Blood military.</font></b>

30

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">in the Military Police.

40

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Apparently, a troublemaker, too.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">After a literal lifetime in the military,
he just up and quits. And then,</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">for only the second time in his life,</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">At least not under his real name.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, sir. There's

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you?</font></b>

How do you know him?</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why wasn't he in protective custody?</font></b>

65

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That was an oversight.</font></b>

66
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,034
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">More like some Corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves.</font></b>

67
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,994
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as likely.</font></b>

68
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,163
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's done and we can't undo it.</font></b>

69

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So what happens now?</font></b>

70

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now he's in a coma.</font></b>

71
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,671
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll try him when he wakes up.
If he wakes up.</font></b>

72
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,464
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.</font></b>

73
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,842
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did he call you as a witness?</font></b>

74
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,510
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't believe he did.</font></b>

75

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I believe
he asked for you by name.</font></b>

76
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,848
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Any chance I could look
at the evidence?</font></b>

77
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,641
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No way.
Not till you answer some questions.</font></b>

78
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,976
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice meeting you.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I take you to Barr,

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you say he shot 5 people,

84

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I know there's a bus station
3 miles away</font></b>

85

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can walk there in 24 minutes.</font></b>

86

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's not my friend.

88
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,037
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, same reason he shot 5 people,

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hold on.</font></b>

90

Now, hey.</font></b>

106

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, "See you in court." For me.</font></b>

110
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,082
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font></b>

111

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you're Jack Reacher.</font></b>

112
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,381
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- So you're the D.A.'s daughter.
- Oh, Jesus. Please.</font></b>

113
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,300
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that even legal?
- Fortunately.</font></b>

114

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- How does that happen?
- I'll tell you after deposition.</font></b>

115
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,887
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to depose me.</font></b>

116

117
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,891
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm not a defence witness.

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not my friend.
Why does everyone assume that?</font></b>

119

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, why else would he ask for you</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't come here to help him.
I came here to bury him.</font></b>

- I'm impossible to find.</font></b>

125
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,476
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is that?</font></b>

126
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,980
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you could say it started out as an

805
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,369
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">That would not explain how Barr,</font></b>

01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,890
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.</font></b>

812
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:16,894
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">And arguably the prosecution's single

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Either way, it doesn't make sense.</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">If he wanted to get away with it,

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">and if he wanted to get caught,</font></b>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font></b>

824

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.</font></b>

825
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:51,387
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Or put me in a coma,

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Patsy?</font></b>

827
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,728
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was such a great crime scene.</font></b>

828
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,772
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">No one stopped to think

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I ever seen this side of civilian life.</font></b>

1117
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:23,097
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm saying

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Barr didn't come alone, did he?</font></b>
