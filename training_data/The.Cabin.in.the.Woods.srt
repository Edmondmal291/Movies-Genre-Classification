1
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,357
It's hormonal.

2
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:08,528
I mean, I don't usually fall back on...
You know, it's women's issues.

3
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:11,615
But child-proofed how? Gates and stuff?

4
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:13,158
Dude, she did the drawers.

5
00:01:13,242 --> 00:01:15,494
We don't even know
if this whole fertility thing's gonna work.

6
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:18,247
She's screwed in these little jobbies
where you can't even open the drawers.

7
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,331
At all?

8
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:22,334
No. They open, you know, like an inch,
then you gotta dig your finger in.

9
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:24,670
- I mean, it's a nightmare.
- I guess sooner or later.

10
00:01:24,753 --> 00:01:27,923
Yeah, well, a lot later.
She did the upper cabinets.

11
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:31,551
Kid will be 30 before he can reach them,
assuming, you know, we have a kid.

12
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,347
It is natural for her to feel protective.

13
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,267
Don't even... You have women's issues.

14
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,310
Please. You of all people.

15
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:42,688
Oh, come on. It's a jinx.

16
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:46,400
It guarantees that we won't get pregnant.

17
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:48,652
And it takes me about 20 minutes
to get a fucking beer.

18
00:01:48,735 --> 00:01:50,195
Guys. Guys!

19
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:51,863
Stockholm went south.

20
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:54,700
Seriously?
I thought they were looking good.

21
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,201
What cracked?

22
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,829
I haven't seen the footage.
Word's just going around.

23
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,539
Well, that's never been a stable scenario.

24
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:02,916
Everyone knows you can't trust Swedes.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,544
That means there's just Japan.
Japan and us.

26
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:07,713
It's not the first time
it's come down to that.

27
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:09,089
Japan has a perfect record.

28
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:10,799
We're number two. We try harder.

29
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:14,136
- But, guys, if we fail, then...
- Please. We haven't had a glitch since '98.

30
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,554
We know what we're doing, Lin.

31
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,806
Or we have it written down, somewhere.

32
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:20,267
You guys better not be
messing around in there.

33
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,979
Does this mean you're not
in the betting pool this year? Big money.

34
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,064
I'm just saying, it's a key scenario.

35
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:27,941
No, I hear what you're saying.

36
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:30,819
In '98,
it was the chem department's fault, right?

37
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:34,740
Where do you work, again?
Wait. It's coming back to me now.

38
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:40,579
It's gonna be a long weekend
if everyone's that puckered up.

39
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:41,830
So, you wanna come over Monday night?

40
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:45,542
I'm gonna pick up some power drills.
Liberate my cabinets.

41
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,337
Are you even listening to me?

42
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,009
Professor Fuckwad.

43
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:38,970
Why haven't you stuck that asshole's
picture on the dartboard yet?

44
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,973
It's not that simple... Oh, my God!

45
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:44,559
- Your hair. It's blonde.
- Very fabulous, no?

46
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:45,685
I can't believe you did it.

47
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,563
But very fabulous, right?

48
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:51,358
Hurry up with the "very fabulous."
I'm getting insecure about it now.

49
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,985
God, no, no, it looks awesome.
Curt's gonna lose it.

50
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,822
Curt's gonna thank me. And so will you.

51
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:59,741
- While we're burning this picture.
- Not ready.

52
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:03,995
Seriously, this isn't his fault.

53
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,664
What's not his fault?

54
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:08,625
Fucking his student
or breaking up with her by e-mail?

55
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,460
I knew what I was getting into.

56
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:11,711
Oh, please.

57
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,588
You know what you're getting into
this weekend?

58
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:16,466
This.

59
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,177
And if Holden's as cute as Curt says he is,

60
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:20,512
possibly getting out of it.

61
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,014
Okay, that is the last thing that I want.

62
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,559
If you guys treat this like a setup,
I'm gonna have no fun at all.

63
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:27,686
I'm not pushing.

64
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:28,895
But we're packing this!

65
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,941
Which means we definitely
won't have room for...

66
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,235
What if I get bored?

67
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,862
These will help?

68
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:42,284
"Soviet Economic Structures"?
"Aftermath of the... "No!

69
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:44,494
We have a lake and a keg.

70
00:04:44,578 --> 00:04:46,121
- No more learning!
- Think fast.

71
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:47,998
Faster than that.

72
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,878
Sorry. Sorry. Move along.

73
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,963
- Nice!
- Is that Holden?

74
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:57,841
We'll be right down.
He just transferred from State.

75
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,635
Best hands on the team. He's a sweet guy.

76
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:01,803
And he's good with his hands.

77
00:05:01,928 --> 00:05:04,598
Hey, I'm kind of seeing this girl,

78
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:07,559
but you're way blonder than she is.

79
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:11,146
But I was thinking, you know, maybe...
What is this?

80
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,064
What are these?
What are you doing with these?

81
00:05:13,148 --> 00:05:14,649
Okay, I get it. I'll leave the books.

82
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,068
No, no, no. Who gave you these?
Who taught you about these?

83
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:19,446
I learned it from you, okay?

84
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,364
I learned it from watching you!

85
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:26,995
Seriously, Professor Bennett,
he covers this whole book in his lectures.

86
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,415
You should read this.

87
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,001
Gurovsky. Now this is way more interesting.

88
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:37,839
Also, Bennett doesn't know it by heart,
so he'll think you're insightful.

89
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:39,382
And you have no pants.

90
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:41,676
Oh, shit!

91
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:49,059
- That pretty much it?
- Fucking better be.

92
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,770
You know, Jules, it's a weekend,
not an evacuation.

93
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:54,689
Trust me when I say
there is nothing in those cases

94
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:57,025
you won't be glad I brought.

95
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,193
I'm shutting right up.

96
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,365
Oh, my God.

97
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:09,538
Marty!

98
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,375
Fuck is wrong with you, bro?

99
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:22,467
People in this town drive
in a very counterintuitive manner.

100
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,219
That's what I have to say.

101
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:26,346
All right, do you wanna spend
the weekend in jail?

102
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,473
'Cause we'd all like to check out
my cousin's country home.

103
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:30,058
Marty, honey, that's not okay.

104
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,185
Statistical fact.

105
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:35,730
Cops will never pull over a man
with a huge bong in his car.

106
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:36,982
Why?

107
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:38,233
They fear this man.

108
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,610
They know he sees further than they,

109
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,657
and he will bind them with ancient logics.

110
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,326
Have you gone gray?

111
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,662
You're not bringing that thing
in the Rambler.

112
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:55,250
What? A giant bong in your father's van?

113
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,545
What are you, stoned?

114
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,590
Hey, man.

115
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:06,386
Dana, you fetching minx!

116
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,887
You have any food?

117
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:12,309
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah!

118
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,227
- Yeah?
- Okay, I'm ready!

119
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:15,854
Let's get this show on the road!

120
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,606
Fuck, yeah!

121
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:37,834
Nest is empty. We're right on time.

122
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:42,047
I hope this is the right road.

123
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,257
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.

124
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:46,092
It is unworthy of global positioning.

125
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:50,722
That's the whole point.
Get off the grid, right?

126
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,515
No cell phone reception,

127
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,226
no traffic cameras.

128
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,437
Go someplace for one goddamn weekend

129
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,982
where they can't
globally position my ass, man.

130
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,984
This is the whole issue.

131
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,653
Is society crumbling, Marty?

132
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:07,822
No. Society is binding. Right?

133
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:10,909
It's filling in the cracks with concrete.

134
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:15,580
Everything's filed or recorded
or blogged, right?

135
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:19,250
Chips in our kids' heads
so they won't get lost.

136
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,211
Society needs to crumble.

137
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:23,963
We're all just too chickenshit to let it.

138
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,465
I've missed your rants.

139
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:29,344
You will come to see things my way.

140
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,059
Identification, please.

141
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:40,814
Mr. Sitterson.

142
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,274
- Mr. Hadley.
- Thank you.

143
00:08:43,358 --> 00:08:45,276
- What's your name?
- Daniel Truman, sir.

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,113
This isn't the military, Truman.
You can drop the "sir."

145
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:51,282
But Sitterson does like
to be called "ma'am."

146
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,952
- Or "honey toes."
- He will also answer to "honey toes."

147
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:55,453
You clear
on what's gonna be happening here?

148
00:08:55,537 --> 00:08:56,830
I've been prepped. Extensively.

149
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,958
And did they tell you that being prepped
is not the same thing as being prepared?

150
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,627
They told me. I'll hold my post, Mr.
Hadley.

151
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:03,878
Good man.

152
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,465
Okay. System's online.

153
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,802
Acquiring target. Let's see what we got.

154
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,785
All right.

155
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:49,674
I'm thinking this thing
doesn't take credit cards.

156
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,344
I don't think it knows about money.

157
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,430
I think it's barter gas.

158
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:17,702
Hello?

159
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,505
Hey, Holden.

160
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,509
- Holden!
- I don't think there's gonna be any...

161
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:33,927
You come here uninvited?

162
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,304
Fuck! Dude.

163
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:42,477
Sign says "closed."

164
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,854
Yeah, we were looking to buy some gas.

165
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:47,357
Does this pump work?

166
00:10:48,024 --> 00:10:49,275
If you know how to work it.

167
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,529
We also wanted to get directions.

168
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,906
Yeah, we're looking for...
What's it called?

169
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,617
Tillerman Road.
Do you know if it's this way?

170
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,039
Tillerman Road takes you
up the hill, there.

171
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:06,125
Dead-ends at the old Buckner place.

172
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,877
My cousin bought a house up there.

173
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:10,588
You go through, like, a mountain tunnel,
there's a lake.

174
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:12,340
- Would that be the...
- Buckner place.

175
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:16,135
Always someone looking to sell that plot.

176
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:17,846
You knew the original owners?

177
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:19,889
Yeah, not the first.

178
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:25,186
I seen plenty come and go.
Hell, I been here since the war.

179
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,772
- Which war?
- You know damn well which war!

180
00:11:28,857 --> 00:11:34,112
Would that have been
with the blue and some in gray?

181
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:37,448
Brother, perhaps,
fighting against brother in that war?

182
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:38,992
You sassing me, boy?

183
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,535
You were rude to my friend.

184
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,037
That whore?

185
00:11:44,372 --> 00:11:46,749
- What'd you say?
- I think we got enough gas.

186
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,376
You got enough to get you there.

187
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:52,547
Getting back, that's your concern.

188
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,937
Well, good luck with your business, sir.

189
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,732
I know the railroad's
coming through here any day now.

190
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,275
That's gonna be big.

191
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:15,612
Streets paved with actual street.

192
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:17,739
Fucker,

193
00:12:55,193 --> 00:12:56,861
Guys, take a look.

194
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:35,191
This must be it.

195
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

196
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,712
One spider, and I'm
sleeping in the Rambler.

197
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:57,714
I mean it.

198
00:13:57,797 --> 00:13:59,257
Come on. Give me a hand.

199
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,107
This is awesome.

200
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,109
It is kind of cool.

201
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:01,986
Are you gonna kill us a raccoon to eat?

202
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,197
I will use its skin to make a cap.

203
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,494
Everybody get your suits on.
In 10 minutes, we're hitting the lake.

204
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:11,370
- Yeah.
- I was not informed

205
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:13,081
there would be calisthenics.

206
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,975
Yeah, I don't think so.

207
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:48,783
No way.

208
00:16:09,095 --> 00:16:10,263
Shit.

209
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:16,519
This is happening.

210
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:25,611
Hold up!

211
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:32,076
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

212
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,536
That's just creepy.

213
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:35,830
It was pioneer days.

214
00:16:35,955 --> 00:16:38,833
People had to make
their own interrogation rooms.

215
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:40,710
Who did your cousin buy this place from?

216
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,129
We should check the rest of the rooms,
make sure this is the only one.

217
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:46,299
'Cause you know Marty wants to
watch us pounding away.

218
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:48,509
I didn't even like hearing that.

219
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,761
Don't be an ape, Curt.

220
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,266
How about we switch?

221
00:16:57,018 --> 00:16:58,895
Not that I'd...
I mean, I'd put the picture back,

222
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,606
but you might feel better
if we switched rooms?

223
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:03,357
I really would.

224
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,280
Thanks. For being decent.

225
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:10,990
It's the least I could do,

226
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,992
since Curt and Jules
sold you to me for marriage.

227
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,620
They're not subtle.

228
00:17:15,703 --> 00:17:18,289
Well, I'll just be flattered
and keep it to myself.

229
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah, I'm not looking for...

230
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,961
But I'm still grateful
that you're not a creep.

231
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:25,546
Let's not jump to any conclusions there.

232
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,424
I had kind of an internal debate
about showing you the mirror.

233
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,427
Shouting on both sides. Blood was spilled.

234
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,929
So, you're bleeding internally?

235
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:35,264
Pretty bad.

236
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:39,060
Well, Jules is pre-med.
You should probably talk to her.

237
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:43,231
Okay.

238
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:34,448
Yeah, I don't think so.

239
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:03,060
- I gotta say, I like my room.
- Over here.

240
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:06,272
Places, everyone. We are live.

241
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:07,982
Engineering, we got a room change.

242
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:11,068
Polk is now in two, McCrea is in four.

243
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:12,987
Operations, do you copy?

244
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,280
We need a scenario adjustment.

245
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:15,948
Miss Lin.

246
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,786
We've got the blood work back on Louden.

247
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,912
Her levels are good,

248
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:24,832
but we're recommending
a 50-milligram bump of Rhohyptase

249
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,584
- to increase libido.
- Sold.

250
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,586
Do we pipe it in,
or do you wanna do it orally?

251
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,005
Ask me that again, only slower.

252
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,673
You're a pig.

253
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:35,134
Guess how we're slowing down cognition.

254
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,344
I don't know.

255
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:39,764
The hair dye.

256
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,557
Dumb blonde. Very artistic.

257
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,686
Works its way into the blood,
through the scalp. Very gradual.

258
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:48,939
Chem department keeps their end up.

259
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,483
I'll see it when I believe it.

260
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:52,943
- Control?
- Yeah, go ahead.

261
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:54,528
I have the harbinger on line two.

262
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:58,032
Oh, Christ. Can you take a message?

263
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:01,452
I don't think so. He's really pushy.

264
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,790
To be honest, he's kind of freaking me out.

265
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,334
Okay. Put him on.

266
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,212
Mordecai, baby, what's happening?
How's the weather up top?

267
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:15,633
The lambs have passed through the gate.
They are come to the killing floor.

268
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,551
Well, you're doing a great job out there.

269
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:21,138
By the numbers, man.
You got us started off just right.

270
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:22,723
So, we'll talk to you later, okay?

271
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:26,811
Their blind eyes see nothing
of the horrors to come.

272
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,104
Their ears are stopped.

273
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,356
They are the gods' fools.

274
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,818
Well, that's how it works.

275
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,780
Cleanse them. Cleanse the world
of their ignorance and sin.

276
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:42,243
Bathe them in the crimson of...
Am I on speakerphone?

277
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,704
No. Absolutely not.

278
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,540
Speakerphone, no. No, I wouldn't do that.

279
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:49,917
Yes, I am. I can hear the echo.

280
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:53,796
Oh, my God. You're right.
Hang on one second, I'll take you off.

281
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:57,299
That's rude. I don't
know who's in the room.

282
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:59,427
Fine. There. You're off.

283
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,886
Thank you.

284
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:03,681
Don't take this lightly, boy.

285
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,224
It wasn't all by your numbers.

286
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:10,104
The fool nearly derailed the invocation
with his insolence.

287
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:13,274
The Ancient Ones see everything.

288
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,608
And they will not be...

289
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,236
I'm still on speakerphone, aren't I?

290
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,574
Oh, my God. Mordecai!

291
00:21:22,158 --> 00:21:23,951
I can't believe it. It did it again!

292
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:25,744
Mordy?

293
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:28,289
What happens next?

294
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,548
That's cold!

295
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,886
Yeah? HOW cold? IS it worth it?

296
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,055
Come on, Jules. Life is risk.

297
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:47,766
Yeah, I might just risk
lying out in the sun for a while.

298
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:50,269
Hey, what is that?

299
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,521
- What?
- In the lake, right there.

300
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,607
- Come on.
- You guys, I'm serious. Right there.

301
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,193
There! There!
God, it looks just like my girlfriend!

302
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,280
Oh, my God!

303
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,823
There's something else in the lake!

304
00:22:05,493 --> 00:22:06,744
It's a gorgeous man!

305
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,953
I'm gonna kill you!

306
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:10,289
Don't kill the gorgeous man!
We're endangered!

307
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:20,257
All right. Last chance. It's post time.

308
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:22,885
Dig deep, people.
Betting windows are closing.

309
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,470
Okay, who's still out?

310
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:29,141
Let's see. We got Engineering,
we got R&D, and we got Electrical.

311
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,936
Did you see who they picked? They're
practically giving their money away.

312
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,522
You should talk, Aquaman.

313
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,690
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

314
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:40,694
Okay, all right.
I'm not even sure we have one of these.

315
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,446
Zoology swears we do.

316
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,282
They'd know. Okay. All right, people.

317
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:47,409
Hey, what do you got?

318
00:22:47,493 --> 00:22:48,786
No, they've already been picked.

319
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:50,287
What? No. Who took them?

320
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:52,039
- Maintenance.
- Maintenance?

321
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:54,166
- They pick the same thing every year.
- What do you want from me?

322
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,043
If they were creative,
they wouldn't be in Maintenance.

323
00:22:56,126 --> 00:23:00,506
Now, you're gonna have to split this
if you win. You wanna switch?

324
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,634
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think?

325
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,886
More than anything,
I just want this moment to end.

326
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,185
- Not betting?
- Not for me. Thanks.

327
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:17,064
Seems a little harsh, doesn't it?

328
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:20,484
It's just people letting off steam.

329
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:24,280
This job isn't easy,
however those clowns may behave.

330
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:28,075
Does The Director...
Do they know about this downstairs?

331
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,493
The Director doesn't care about this stuff.

332
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:31,537
As long as everything
goes smoothly upstairs,

333
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,622
as long as the kids do as they're told.

334
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:34,957
But then it's fixed.

335
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,667
No, no, no.

336
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,712
How can you wager on this
when you control the outcome?

337
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,506
No, we just get them in the cellar.
They take it from there.

338
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,800
No, they have to make the choice
of their own free will.

339
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,011
Otherwise the system doesn't work.

340
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:48,846
It's like the harbinger.

341
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:53,350
It's this creepy old fuck,
practically wears a sign, "You will die."

342
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:56,145
Why do we put him there? The system.

343
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:57,688
They have to choose to ignore him,

344
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,440
and they have to choose
what happens in the cellar.

345
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,984
Yeah, we rig the game
as much as we need to,

346
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,528
but in the end, they don't transgress...

347
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,363
They can't be punished.

348
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:09,950
So what's it gonna be, Truman?
You in? Window's closing.

349
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:12,953
I'm fine.

350
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,875
Okay. That's it, gang!

351
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,251
The board is locked!

352
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,795
Let's get this party started!

353
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:23,964
Let's get this party started!

354
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:35,809
Yeah, okay, who wants a beer?

355
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,353
There you go.

356
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,812
Okay, my turn.

357
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:39,980
Jules.

358
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:44,568
Truth or dare?

359
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:46,654
- Let's go dare.
- All right.

360
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:50,908
I dare you to make out with...

361
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,951
Please say "Dana," please say "Dana,"
please say "Dana."

362
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:54,828
...that moose, over there.

363
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,584
Marty, have you ever seen a moose before?

364
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,089
Whatever that mysterious beast is.

365
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,423
- That's a wolf.
- That's clearly a wolf.

366
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:10,719
I'm living in a womb of reefer,
leave me alone.

367
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:12,429
Jules,

368
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,557
I dare you to make out with that wolf.

369
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,310
No problem.

370
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:44,878
Who?

371
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:46,046
Me?

372
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,718
Why, yes, I am new in town.
How did you know?

373
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,514
Oh, my God. That is so sweet of you to say.

374
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:56,765
I just colored it, in fact.

375
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:58,559
No, no, no.

376
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,562
There's no need to huff and puff.

377
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,398
I'll let you come in.

378
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:39,141
Thank you.

379
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:46,356
- Yeah.
- All right.

380
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,692
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby!

381
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,613
Now, then.

382
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:55,824
- Dana.
- Truth.

383
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,744
What's that supposed to mean?

384
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,997
I'm just skipping ahead.
You're gonna say dare.

385
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,166
She's gonna dare you
to do something you don't like,

386
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:08,504
and then you'll puss out
and say that you wanted truth all along.

387
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:09,630
Really?

388
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,718
Okay, Jules. Dare.

389
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,679
What the hell was that?

390
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:19,389
It's the cellar door.

391
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,226
The wind must've blown it open.

392
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,395
That makes what kind of sense?

393
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:28,315
What do you think is down there?

394
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,779
Why don't we find out?

395
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:36,532
Dana.

396
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:39,660
I dare you.

397
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:58,595
How long do I have to stay down here?

398
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,848
You know, just till morning.

399
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,134
Dana.

400
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,845
You Okay?

401
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:41,889
Yeah.

402
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,726
Sorry, I just scared myself.

403
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:49,605
Well, you called for help.
That voids the dare. Take your top off.

404
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:51,398
What?

405
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,233
I don't make up the rules.

406
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,279
Oh, my God.

407
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:01,909
Look at all this.

408
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,413
Guys,

409
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:11,627
I'm not sure it's awesome to be down here.

410
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:13,837
Guys?

411
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:18,550
Dude, seriously,
your cousin is into some weird shit.

412
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:22,387
Yeah, well, I'm pretty sure this ain't his.

413
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,558
Maybe it was the people
who put in that mirror thing.

414
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,438
Some of this stuff looks really old.

415
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:33,774
It's beautiful.

416
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,405
Maybe we should go back upstairs.

417
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,204
I dare you all to go upstairs.

418
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,676
Guys?

419
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,804
Guys, listen to this.

420
00:30:46,722 --> 00:30:47,889
"April 4th.

421
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:52,144
"Father was cross with me
and said I lacked the true faith.

422
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,730
"I wish I could prove my devotion

423
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,691
"as Judah and Matthew proved
on those travelers."

424
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,151
What is that?

425
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:04,823
"Diary of Anna Patience Buckner, 1903.

426
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,036
"Mama screamed most of the night.

427
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,829
"I prayed that she might find faith,

428
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,540
"but she only stopped
when Papa cut her belly

429
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:15,667
"and stuffed the coals in.

430
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,336
"Judah told me in my dream

431
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:22,549
"that Matthew took him to the black room,
so I know he is killed.

432
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:27,512
"I want to understand the glory of the pain
like Matthew,

433
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:33,310
"but cutting the flesh
makes him have a husband's bulge

434
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:35,812
"and I do not get like that."

435
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,106
- Jesus. Can we not...
- No, no. Go on.

436
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,316
- Why?
- I want to know.

437
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,651
"I have found it

438
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:46,031
"in the oldest books,
the way of saving our family.

439
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,325
"My good arm is hacked up

440
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:52,079
"and et, so I hope this will be readable.

441
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:56,249
"That a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits.

442
00:31:56,833 --> 00:32:00,462
"Then we will be restored
and the great pain will return."

443
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:04,591
And then there's something in Latin.

444
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,136
Okay, I'm drawing a line
in the fucking sand, here.

445
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,679
Do not read the Latin.

446
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,389
Read it.

447
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:13,850
What the fuck?

448
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,185
Read it out loud.

449
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,728
No, no, no.

450
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,438
Stop being a fucking baby.

451
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,273
- Curt!
- It's a diary.

452
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,818
- It doesn't even mean anything.
- Dana!

453
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:07,863
We have a winner!

454
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,739
It's the Buckners, ladies and gentlemen.

455
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,409
The Buckners pull a

456
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:18,248
All right. That means
that congratulations go to Maintenance,

457
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,335
who share the pot with Ronald the intern.

458
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:25,755
- Yeah!
- Wait. That's not fair. I had zombies, too.

459
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,090
Yes, you did. Yes, you had zombies.

460
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:30,677
But this is
"Zombie Redneck Torture Family," see?

461
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:32,804
They're entirely separate species.

462
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,640
Like the difference between an elephant
and an elephant seal.

463
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,894
There's always next year.

464
00:33:40,187 --> 00:33:42,105
They're like something from a nightmare.

465
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:45,942
No. They're something nightmares are from.

466
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:50,780
Everything in our stable
is remnant of the old world,

467
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:53,783
courtesy of you-know-who.

468
00:33:54,242 --> 00:33:56,203
Monsters. Magic.

469
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,038
Gods.

470
00:33:58,121 --> 00:33:59,748
You get used to it.

471
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:02,876
Should you?

472
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:13,970
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

473
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:15,722
- He had the conch in his hands.
- I know. I know.

474
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:18,433
A couple more minutes,
who knows what might've happened?

475
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:21,394
I am never gonna see a merman. Ever.

476
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,814
Dude, be thankful.
Those things are terrifying.

477
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,609
And the cleanup on them is a nightmare.

478
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:30,862
So, the Buckners.

479
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:35,325
Yeah, well, they may be zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

480
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:38,954
But they're our zombified,
pain-worshipping, backwoods idiots.

481
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:41,164
- With a 100% clearance rate.
- True.

482
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:43,875
So should we call Japan?

483
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,418
Tell them to take
the rest of the weekend off?

484
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:48,171
Yeah, right. They're Japanese.
What are they gonna do? Relax?

485
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,590
I'd just like to see them
fall on their asses for once.

486
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:54,010
Oh, God, don't even joke.
Every other branch has air-balled.

487
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:57,305
We need the Japanese crew to get it done.
There's too much riding on this.

488
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:41,391
Fuck, yeah, baby.

489
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,643
This is so classy.

490
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,937
Come on,
like you wouldn't want a piece of that.

491
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:49,482
Can we not talk
about people in pieces anymore tonight?

492
00:35:51,234 --> 00:35:53,153
Are you feeling lonely, Marty?

493
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:59,159
Marty and I were sweeties
in our freshman hall.

494
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,578
We made out once.

495
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:04,664
I never did buy that ring.

496
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,833
But we're still

497
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:09,961
close.

498
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:16,801
I have a theory about all this.

499
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,596
That's our cue to bail.

500
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,723
Tommy Chong here has a theory.

501
00:36:21,806 --> 00:36:23,725
Come on, baby.

502
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,977
Don't worry, you can tell
it to Egghead, here,

503
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:28,855
if he's not too busy de-virginizing Dana.

504
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:31,691
Jules, do you wanna go lie down?

505
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,070
That's exactly the point.
Come on. Mush. Mush.

506
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:38,156
- Don't push me around.
- Not around, baby. Straight line.

507
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:03,932
You seriously believe
nothing weird is going on?

508
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:06,309
Conspiracy?

509
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,061
The way everybody's acting.

510
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,064
Why is Jules suddenly a celebu-tard?

511
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:16,194
And since when does Curt
pull this alpha-male bullshit?

512
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:19,197
I mean, he's a sociology major.

513
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,032
He's on full academic scholarship,

514
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,868
and now he's calling his friend an egghead?

515
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,620
Curt's just drunk.

516
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:28,248
I've seen Curt drunk.

517
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:30,834
Jules, too.

518
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,919
Well, then, maybe it's something else.

519
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,007
You're not seeing
what you don't wanna see.

520
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,803
Puppeteers.

521
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,014
- Puppeteers?
- Pop-Tarts?

522
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,307
Did you say you have Pop-Tarts?

523
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:50,645
Marty, I love you, but you're really high.

524
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:56,359
We are not who we are.

525
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:02,907
I'm gonna go read a book with pictures.

526
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:04,701
Thank you.

527
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:07,495
"The pain outlives the flesh.

528
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,624
"The flesh returns..."
or "has a meeting place."

529
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,084
What is that?

530
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,128
The Latin that you read in the basement.

531
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,504
You speak Latin?

532
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,593
Not well. Not since 10th grade.

533
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:22,969
Weird how it all comes back.

534
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,513
Well, it's a weird kind of night.

535
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,766
I'm sorry about tonight.

536
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,685
Everybody...

537
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:33,980
Do I lose points if I tell you
I'm having a pretty nice time?

538
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:39,152
No. You can tell me that.

539
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,368
What are you running away for?

540
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:55,960
Don't spill on me!

541
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:57,587
Did I get a little beer on your shirt?

542
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:01,341
I guess it'll have to come off, huh?

543
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,179
Not here.

544
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,014
Baby, come on.

545
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:09,933
We're all alone.

546
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,361
I'm chilly.

547
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:26,824
Okay, guys. That's it. Let's go.
We've got a job to do.

548
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,661
Your basic human needs disgust me.
Get out of here.

549
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,496
Do we have temperature control
in this sector?

550
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:32,747
On it.

551
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:39,921
Engaging pheromone mists.

552
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,782
It's so dark.

553
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:09,576
Take me inside?

554
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,703
Come on. This is why we came here.

555
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,164
It's romantic.

556
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,436
Okay, baby. Let's see some boobies.

557
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:38,771
Show us the goods.

558
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:41,899
Does it really matter if we see her...

559
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:43,610
We're not the only ones watching, kid.

560
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,528
Gotta keep the customer satisfied.

561
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,324
You understand what's at stake, here?

562
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,702
Score.

563
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:08,861
Jules!

564
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:13,157
Fuck.

565
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,034
Curt!

566
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:36,973
Curt!

567
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,335
No! No!

568
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:11,090
Please! Please!

569
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:13,301
No!

570
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:15,511
No!

571
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:16,596
Curt!

572
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,856
This we offer in humility and fear.

573
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:30,777
For the blessed peace
of your eternal slumber.

574
00:43:31,611 --> 00:43:32,737
As it ever was.

575
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,280
As it ever was.

576
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:29,043
Nemo, man, you gotta wake up.
Your shit is topsy-turvy.

577
00:44:32,004 --> 00:44:34,257
I'm gonna go for a walk.

578
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:37,635
Okay. I swear to fucking God,
somebody is talking.

579
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,017
Or I'm pretty sure someone is.

580
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:48,187
I'm gonna go for a walk.

581
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,398
Enough!

582
00:44:50,982 --> 00:44:52,358
What are you saying?

583
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:54,944
What do you want?

584
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,031
You think I'm a puppet, huh?

585
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,868
You think I'm a puppet? Gonna do a little

586
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:04,120
fucking puppet dance!

587
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:07,665
I'm the boss of my own
brain, so give it up.

588
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:13,379
I'm gonna go for a walk.

589
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:27,602
I don't wanna... I mean, I've never...

590
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:31,939
- I don't mean "never"...
- Hey.

591
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:34,859
Nothing you don't want.

592
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,489
He's got a husband bulge.

593
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,927
I thought there'd be stars.

594
00:46:05,681 --> 00:46:07,725
We are abandoned.

595
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:35,628
- Fuck!
- Fucking run!

596
00:46:37,088 --> 00:46:38,130
Curt!

597
00:46:38,798 --> 00:46:40,174
Dead bitch!

598
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,471
Jesus, what happened?

599
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:46,889
- Curt!
- What the fuck?

600
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,140
Curt, what the fuck?

601
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:49,392
- Where are you hurt?
- Hold on. Hold on.

602
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:50,977
Is all of this from you?

603
00:46:51,394 --> 00:46:52,728
It's okay! Curt, you're okay!

604
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:54,313
Where's Jules?

605
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:58,943
She's gone.

606
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:02,905
We've gotta get out of here.

607
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:05,282
No. No. Wait.

608
00:47:05,366 --> 00:47:07,576
- Dana, don't open that...
- I'm not leaving here without Jules.

609
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,828
That dead girl's out there!

610
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,051
No!

611
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:33,436
Dana, come on!

612
00:47:38,691 --> 00:47:39,775
What is that thing?

613
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:42,194
- Fuck!
- I don't know, but there's more of them.

614
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:43,279
More of them?

615
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:45,114
Yeah. I saw a young girl.

616
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,033
All zombied like him,

617
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:48,534
but she was missing an arm.

618
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:52,246
Oh, my God. Patience.

619
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:54,582
- The diary.
- Look.

620
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,625
- We gotta lock this place down.
- He's right.

621
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,962
We'll go room by room.
Barricade every window and door.

622
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,631
We gotta play it safe.
No matter what happens,

623
00:48:02,715 --> 00:48:04,008
we have to stay together.

624
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:06,844
Fuck!

625
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:07,970
Calm down.

626
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:09,680
Watch the master work.

627
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:22,401
This isn't right.

628
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:24,028
What? What's the matter?

629
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:27,490
This isn't right. We should split up.

630
00:48:28,783 --> 00:48:30,367
We can cover more ground that way.

631
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,495
Yeah.

632
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:35,706
Yeah. Good idea.

633
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:38,209
Really?

634
00:48:39,085 --> 00:48:40,753
All right, guys, you
guys, get in your rooms.

635
00:48:45,174 --> 00:48:46,217
Lock them in.

636
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:55,226
What the fuck?

637
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:09,115
What the...

638
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:19,667
What the fuck?

639
00:49:20,501 --> 00:49:21,627
That's not good.

640
00:49:21,961 --> 00:49:23,212
Out of the way. Out of the way.
Out of the way.

641
00:49:23,963 --> 00:49:26,423
Chem department,
I need 500 ccs of Thorazine

642
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:28,843
- pumped into room three.
- No, no, no.

643
00:49:28,926 --> 00:49:29,969
Stand by, Chem.

644
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,847
Judah Buckner to the rescue.

645
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:37,768
What the fuck?

646
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:42,648
Fuck! What the fuck?

647
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:48,946
Oh, my God.

648
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:52,741
I'm on a reality TV show.

649
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:59,290
My parents are gonna think
I'm such a burnout.

650
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:38,537
No! No! No!

651
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:50,424
Help me! Help me!

652
00:51:16,951 --> 00:51:18,911
Must be getting excited downstairs.

653
00:51:19,411 --> 00:51:20,412
Greatest show on Earth.

654
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:40,140
Somebody open the door!

655
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:44,103
Come on!

656
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:55,447
- Use the bed!
- Come on! Come on!

657
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:01,287
Holden.

658
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:13,507
- It's empty.
- Go.

659
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:17,094
- Curt?
- Unlock the door.

660
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:18,971
I can't. Get down to the basement.

661
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:38,741
This is the black room.

662
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:40,951
Which?

663
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,913
From the diary.

664
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:48,959
This is where he killed them.

665
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:52,921
This is where he kills us.

666
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:55,007
No way. No.

667
00:52:55,591 --> 00:52:58,510
He's not gonna kill us.
We just gotta find a door.

668
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:00,554
Okay?

669
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:05,351
Let's just check the walls, okay?

670
00:53:07,561 --> 00:53:08,687
Curt?

671
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:10,356
I mean, there's gotta be...

672
00:53:27,206 --> 00:53:28,457
You like pain?

673
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:33,837
How's that work for you?

674
00:53:58,028 --> 00:53:59,405
These fucking zombies.

675
00:53:59,571 --> 00:54:01,532
Remember when you could
just throw a girl in a volcano?

676
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:03,617
How old do you think I am?

677
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:13,752
Let's move! Come on! Come on! Go!

678
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:27,933
What about Marty?

679
00:54:28,392 --> 00:54:29,852
They got him.

680
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:20,819
FUCK you!

681
00:55:21,028 --> 00:55:24,156
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
FUCK you!

682
00:55:27,868 --> 00:55:29,828
- You seeing this?
- Perfect record, huh?

683
00:55:29,912 --> 00:55:32,372
The Japan crew should've had this
in the bag. They fucked us.

684
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:34,041
How hard is it to kill 9-year-olds?

685
00:55:34,124 --> 00:55:36,126
Zero fatality. Total wash.

686
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:39,713
I'm telling you, you want good product,
you gotta buy American.

687
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:42,132
Any word from downstairs?

688
00:55:42,257 --> 00:55:44,760
Downstairs doesn't care about Japan.
The Director trusts us.

689
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:46,678
Hey, you just sweat the chem, Lin.

690
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:50,140
While these morons are singing
What a Friend We Have in Shinto,

691
00:55:50,224 --> 00:55:51,558
we are bringing the pain.

692
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:53,852
Yeah, and what the fuck's up
with this guy's pot, anyway?

693
00:55:54,061 --> 00:55:56,522
He's supposed to be drooling
and instead he almost makes us?

694
00:55:56,688 --> 00:55:58,273
We treated the shit out of it.

695
00:55:58,482 --> 00:56:00,442
Okay, we've got the Rambler
heading toward the tunnel.

696
00:56:00,859 --> 00:56:02,528
The fool's toast anyway.

697
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:05,531
And so are we
if you don't get this under control.

698
00:56:06,365 --> 00:56:08,242
- Shit.
- What? "Shit" Why?

699
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:10,285
- Gotta go. Work to do.
- You guys are humanity's last hope.

700
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:11,703
If the Ancients rise, we...

701
00:56:12,788 --> 00:56:14,289
- There's no cave-in.
- What?

702
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,832
The fucking tunnel's open!

703
00:56:17,376 --> 00:56:18,627
Control to Demolition.

704
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,878
We're dark on the whole sector.

705
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:20,963
Try to bypass it.

706
00:56:21,046 --> 00:56:22,881
- What the fuck do you think I'm doing?
- Okay, open the door.

707
00:56:32,266 --> 00:56:33,559
Look out! Get out of the way!

708
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:35,394
Make a hole.

709
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:42,317
- What the fuck's going on?
- We don't know.

710
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:43,610
Electrical said there was a glitch up top.

711
00:56:43,694 --> 00:56:45,070
That tunnel should've blown hours ago.

712
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:47,030
- Yeah, well, we didn't get the order.
- Come on.

713
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:52,869
Right there.

714
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:01,378
Hadley, what is going on?

715
00:57:02,212 --> 00:57:05,382
Hadley? Why hasn't the tunnel blown?

716
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:10,929
Fuck!

717
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:56,725
No.

718
00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:59,895
No, no. No fucking way!

719
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:04,691
Can't believe this, man.
This ain't happening.

720
00:58:06,151 --> 00:58:08,070
It's right there.

721
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:10,447
All right. We got any climbing gear? Ropes?

722
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,491
Yeah. In my fucking dorm room.

723
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,827
We can't go back. There's no way across.

724
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:17,996
What are we gonna do? Jump?

725
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:20,123
Dude.

726
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:22,793
What?

727
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:29,925
Curt, are you sure about this?

728
00:58:30,008 --> 00:58:31,593
I've done bigger jumps than this.

729
00:58:31,843 --> 00:58:33,053
You've got a smooth run

730
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:35,180
and maybe a five-foot differential
on the other side.

731
00:58:35,847 --> 00:58:37,349
But you've gotta give it everything.

732
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:39,351
Curt.

733
00:58:42,354 --> 00:58:43,980
Look, you guys just stay in the Rambler.

734
00:58:44,606 --> 00:58:45,649
I'll get help.

735
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,443
If I wipe out, I'll fucking limp for help.

736
00:58:49,528 --> 00:58:51,405
But I'm coming back here.

737
00:58:51,488 --> 00:58:54,366
I'm coming back with cops and choppers

738
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:57,452
and large fucking guns,
and those things are gonna pay.

739
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:01,039
For Jules.

740
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:11,717
Don't hold back.

741
00:59:13,343 --> 00:59:14,553
Never do.

742
00:59:39,578 --> 00:59:40,746
No!

743
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,289
Curt!

744
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,417
No! Oh, God!

745
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:48,628
Oh, God!

746
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:55,594
He hit something. There's nothing.
What'd he hit?

747
00:59:58,805 --> 00:59:59,806
Puppeteers.

748
01:00:02,893 --> 01:00:03,977
Marty was right.

749
01:00:04,853 --> 01:00:06,021
Get in the van.

750
01:00:08,774 --> 01:00:09,900
Dana.

751
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,406
Marty was right.

752
01:00:36,134 --> 01:00:37,302
You're going back.

753
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:38,887
I'm going through.

754
01:00:39,346 --> 01:00:42,057
And we'll just drive.
There's gotta be another road.

755
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,683
- Another way out of here.
- It won't work.

756
01:00:46,228 --> 01:00:49,356
Something will happen.
It will collapse, it will wash away.

757
01:00:49,856 --> 01:00:52,526
Then we just leave the roads altogether.

758
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:56,112
Drive as far as we can into the forest
and we go on foot from there.

759
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:00,116
You're missing the point.

760
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:04,663
Please, do not go nuts on me, okay, Dana?
You're all I've got now.

761
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:10,335
I'm okay.

762
01:01:10,502 --> 01:01:11,920
Good, okay, 'cause I need you calm.

763
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:15,757
Okay, no matter what happens,
we gotta stick...

764
01:02:13,356 --> 01:02:16,985
- Goddamn, that was close!
- Yeah, photo-fucking-finish.

765
01:02:17,694 --> 01:02:19,988
I don't understand. You're celebrating?

766
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:22,782
They're celebrating. I'm drinking.

767
01:02:23,742 --> 01:02:24,868
But she's still alive.

768
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,244
How can the ritual be complete?

769
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:29,831
The virgin's death is optional,
as long as it's last.

770
01:02:29,915 --> 01:02:32,083
Main thing is that she suffers.

771
01:02:32,876 --> 01:02:34,169
That she did.

772
01:02:35,921 --> 01:02:38,673
It's so strange.

773
01:02:38,757 --> 01:02:40,550
I'm actually rooting for this girl.

774
01:02:41,343 --> 01:02:43,053
She's got so much heart.

775
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:47,682
And you think of all the pain and the...

776
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:51,144
Tequila is my lady! My lady!

777
01:02:51,227 --> 01:02:53,772
Come on in, guys! Come on in. Come on in.
You're welcome.

778
01:02:53,855 --> 01:02:57,442
Tequila! From darkness, there is light.

779
01:04:04,509 --> 01:04:06,594
I wish that I could do what you do.

780
01:04:06,678 --> 01:04:08,805
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's masterful.

781
01:04:09,347 --> 01:04:12,017
I don't know. Tonight was solid.
I don't know.

782
01:04:12,142 --> 01:04:15,186
Are you kidding? Classic denouement.
When the van hits the lake...

783
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,271
- I screamed.
- Right?

784
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:18,940
And the water rushing in, and the zombie...

785
01:04:19,024 --> 01:04:21,901
I just think it would've been cooler
with a merman.

786
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:23,987
Do you know if we get the overtime bonus
on this one?

787
01:04:25,071 --> 01:04:26,573
Accounting's over there. Ask them.

788
01:04:27,198 --> 01:04:28,616
I don't need to. I already know the answer.

789
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,493
I'm an intern.

790
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:34,539
So I don't qualify for OT.

791
01:04:34,873 --> 01:04:36,666
It's funny that you like the ballet,

792
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:41,629
because I happen to have two tickets
to your favorite...

793
01:04:43,131 --> 01:04:45,133
You knuckleheads.

794
01:04:45,425 --> 01:04:47,510
You almost gave me a heart attack
with that tunnel.

795
01:04:47,594 --> 01:04:50,138
Like I said, it wasn't our fault.
We didn't get the order.

796
01:04:50,221 --> 01:04:54,142
Okay. All right,
I'm just giving you a hard time.

797
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:56,102
- Come on. Give us a hug.
- Hey.

798
01:04:56,394 --> 01:04:58,063
No, seriously. That wasn't our fault.

799
01:04:58,313 --> 01:05:00,899
There was a glitch.
Power re-route from upstairs.

800
01:05:03,026 --> 01:05:04,569
What do you mean, "upstairs"?

801
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,291
Turn the fucking music off.

802
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,598
Hello?

803
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:37,435
That's impossible.
Everything was done within the guidelines.

804
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:39,687
The virgin's the only one...

805
01:05:41,106 --> 01:05:43,108
No. I am not doubting you.

806
01:05:45,944 --> 01:05:46,945
Which one?

807
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:30,697
- Marty.
- Hi.

808
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,493
Dana!

809
01:06:37,996 --> 01:06:38,997
Dana, come on.

810
01:07:04,355 --> 01:07:05,732
Marty. Wait.

811
01:07:05,857 --> 01:07:07,192
We're going in the grave?

812
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:11,529
Dana, come on!

813
01:07:27,795 --> 01:07:28,880
What is this place?

814
01:07:34,177 --> 01:07:38,097
Yeah. I had to dismember that guy
with a trowel.

815
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,310
What have you been up to?

816
01:07:48,024 --> 01:07:49,400
Nobody else, huh?

817
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:57,742
Yeah, I figured.

818
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:00,745
You figured everything.

819
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:02,914
Not at all.

820
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,833
But I do know some stuff.

821
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,211
As in...

822
01:08:13,424 --> 01:08:14,759
It's an elevator.

823
01:08:15,802 --> 01:08:18,930
Somebody sent those dead fucks
up here to get us.

824
01:08:20,098 --> 01:08:24,394
Now, there's no controls inside,
but there's maintenance overrides in there.

825
01:08:24,644 --> 01:08:26,980
And I think I can get it to go down.

826
01:08:28,648 --> 01:08:30,358
Do we wanna go down?

827
01:08:33,194 --> 01:08:34,529
Where else are we gonna go?

828
01:08:38,616 --> 01:08:40,994
Come on. Get in.

829
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:44,956
Okay, okay, okay.

830
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:55,425
Come on!

831
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,051
Fucking zombie arm.

832
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,654
Oh, shit.

833
01:09:55,777 --> 01:09:57,028
Shit!

834
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:04,369
Oh, my God.

835
01:11:07,682 --> 01:11:08,933
We chose.

836
01:11:09,976 --> 01:11:12,353
What? What?

837
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,566
Fuck!

838
01:11:22,196 --> 01:11:23,239
In the cellar.

839
01:11:25,241 --> 01:11:26,993
All that shit we were playing with.

840
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,120
They made us choose.

841
01:11:31,747 --> 01:11:33,166
They made us choose how we die.

842
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:15,041
We saw them go down the access drop.
They have to be in one of these.

843
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:16,709
Internal security can...

844
01:12:16,792 --> 01:12:19,629
I don't care if it's not protocol.
Are you fucking high?

845
01:12:19,712 --> 01:12:21,923
It's the fool! Do not touch the girl.

846
01:12:22,006 --> 01:12:23,925
If he outlives her,
this whole thing goes to hell.

847
01:12:24,509 --> 01:12:25,593
Take him out first.

848
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:28,221
Cleanup says the prep team
missed one of the kid's stashes.

849
01:12:28,304 --> 01:12:30,848
Whatever he's been smoking's
been immunizing him to all our shit.

850
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:32,517
How does that help us right now? What?

851
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:35,728
No, if you have a confirmed kill,
take her out, too.

852
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:37,021
There.

853
01:12:37,688 --> 01:12:38,689
36-06.

854
01:12:40,316 --> 01:12:41,400
Gotcha.

855
01:12:41,859 --> 01:12:42,944
Bring them down.

856
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:03,381
Step out of the elevator!
Step out of the elevator!

857
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:04,715
Why are you trying to kill us?

858
01:13:04,799 --> 01:13:06,759
Step out! Just the girl!

859
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:08,302
- What?
- Just me?

860
01:13:08,386 --> 01:13:09,554
DO it!

861
01:13:20,565 --> 01:13:21,732
Good work, zombie arm.

862
01:13:23,109 --> 01:13:24,110
All right.

863
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:48,801
You shouldn't be here.

864
01:13:51,137 --> 01:13:52,805
This should have gone differently.

865
01:13:53,848 --> 01:13:55,224
Ended more quickly.

866
01:13:56,684 --> 01:13:59,729
I can only imagine your pain and confusion.

867
01:14:00,021 --> 01:14:01,772
But know this.

868
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:05,401
What's happening to you
is part of something bigger.

869
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:08,112
Something older than anything known.

870
01:14:10,156 --> 01:14:11,907
You've seen horrible things.

871
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:14,952
An army of nightmare creatures.

872
01:14:15,578 --> 01:14:18,331
But they are nothing
compared to what came before.

873
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:20,875
What lies below.

874
01:14:23,085 --> 01:14:26,172
It's our task to placate the Ancient Ones.

875
01:14:27,465 --> 01:14:30,259
As it's yours to be offered up to them.

876
01:14:31,761 --> 01:14:32,803
Forgive us.

877
01:14:33,638 --> 01:14:35,056
And let us get it over with.

878
01:14:36,432 --> 01:14:38,225
Come on. Go in that room.

879
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:01,874
Army of nightmares, huh?

880
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:13,427
Let's get this party started.

881
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:15,971
Hold fire!

882
01:15:30,569 --> 01:15:31,862
Oh, shit.

883
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:49,547
Go! Go! Go!

884
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:04,455
Lead officer Truman to security command.

885
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:08,417
Requesting immediate reinforcements.
Code black. I repeat. Code black.

886
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:10,169
Where the fuck are you guys?

887
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,756
Sector 12, down. Sector 8, down.

888
01:17:13,839 --> 01:17:16,300
- Sector 3, down.
- Jesus Christ!

889
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:18,677
Why aren't the defenses working?
Where's the fucking gas?

890
01:17:18,761 --> 01:17:21,096
Something chewed through the connections
from the utility shaft.

891
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,098
- Something which?
- Something scary!

892
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,092
The north exit is blocked.
You can't go there.

893
01:18:22,032 --> 01:18:23,367
Go, go, go!

894
01:19:14,043 --> 01:19:15,753
Fuck! We're running out of time!

895
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:17,421
It's on lockdown, I'm trying to bypass.

896
01:19:31,602 --> 01:19:32,770
Hadley!

897
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:05,052
Oh, come on!

898
01:20:14,478 --> 01:20:15,646
Oh, my God!

899
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:16,814
God!

900
01:20:45,884 --> 01:20:47,094
It's you.

901
01:20:52,057 --> 01:20:55,394
No, no, no. Please, please. Please. Please.

902
01:20:59,815 --> 01:21:00,816
Kill him.

903
01:21:09,116 --> 01:21:11,201
Okay, Dana, come on.

904
01:21:11,285 --> 01:21:12,369
Dana.

905
01:21:14,705 --> 01:21:17,374
Here. It's easier with this.

906
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:23,857
Look at these.

907
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:28,737
Five of them.

908
01:22:29,446 --> 01:22:30,697
What are they?

909
01:22:33,492 --> 01:22:34,535
Us.

910
01:22:35,828 --> 01:22:37,121
I should have seen it like you did.

911
01:22:39,957 --> 01:22:41,291
This is part of a ritual.

912
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:44,128
A ritual sacrifice?

913
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:48,382
Great.

914
01:22:48,674 --> 01:22:53,720
You tie someone to a stone,
get a fancy dagger and a bunch of robes.

915
01:22:54,638 --> 01:22:56,306
- It's not that complicated.
- No.

916
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:58,016
It's simple.

917
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:00,811
They don't just want to see us killed.

918
01:23:03,522 --> 01:23:04,606
They want to see us punished.

919
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:08,026
Punished for what?

920
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:10,070
For being young.

921
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:19,163
It's different in every culture.

922
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:24,334
And it has changed over the years,
but it has always required youth.

923
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,838
There must be at least five.

924
01:23:30,174 --> 01:23:31,508
The whore.

925
01:23:31,717 --> 01:23:33,135
She's corrupted.

926
01:23:33,218 --> 01:23:34,261
She dies first.

927
01:23:36,138 --> 01:23:37,347
The athlete.

928
01:23:39,516 --> 01:23:40,893
The scholar.

929
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:44,104
The fool.

930
01:23:44,521 --> 01:23:47,065
All suffer and die at the hands of

931
01:23:47,524 --> 01:23:49,484
whatever horror they have raised,

932
01:23:50,194 --> 01:23:53,906
leaving the last to live or die,

933
01:23:53,989 --> 01:23:55,574
as fate decides.

934
01:23:58,368 --> 01:23:59,411
The virgin.

935
01:24:01,622 --> 01:24:02,664
Me?

936
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:04,917
Virgin?

937
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:06,543
We work with what we have.

938
01:24:08,212 --> 01:24:09,713
But what if you don't pull it off?

939
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:11,757
- They rise.
- Who does?

940
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:15,052
What's beneath us?

941
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:16,887
The Ancient Ones.

942
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:19,056
The gods that used to rule the Earth.

943
01:24:19,723 --> 01:24:23,060
As long as they accept our sacrifice,
they remain below.

944
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,729
But the other rituals have all failed.

945
01:24:29,358 --> 01:24:31,235
The sun is coming up in eight minutes.

946
01:24:32,236 --> 01:24:34,529
If you live to see it, the world will end.

947
01:24:35,697 --> 01:24:37,199
Maybe that's the way it should be.

948
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:40,702
If you've got to kill all
my friends to survive,

949
01:24:41,078 --> 01:24:42,621
maybe it's time for a change.

950
01:24:42,746 --> 01:24:44,665
We're not talking about change.

951
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:49,503
We're talking about the agonizing death
of every human soul on the planet.

952
01:24:50,379 --> 01:24:51,546
Including you.

953
01:24:52,214 --> 01:24:54,007
You can die with them,

954
01:24:56,009 --> 01:24:57,594
or you can die for them.

955
01:25:00,722 --> 01:25:02,766
Gosh, they're both so enticing.

956
01:25:22,953 --> 01:25:24,371
The whole world, Marty.

957
01:25:24,496 --> 01:25:25,914
Is in your hands, Dana.

958
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,251
There is no other way.

959
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,962
You have to be strong.

960
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,090
Yeah, Dana.

961
01:25:36,717 --> 01:25:38,135
You feeling strong?

962
01:25:41,013 --> 01:25:42,347
I'm sorry.

963
01:25:46,268 --> 01:25:47,519
So am I.

964
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:31,480
(Mart)'-

965
01:26:37,361 --> 01:26:38,528
Marty!

966
01:27:32,749 --> 01:27:33,792
Hey-

967
01:27:37,421 --> 01:27:38,839
You know,

968
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,469
I don't think Curt even has a cousin.

969
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:54,646
How are you?

970
01:27:58,275 --> 01:27:59,651
Going away.

971
01:28:03,613 --> 01:28:04,948
I'm sorry.

972
01:28:07,284 --> 01:28:10,912
I'm so sorry I almost shot you.

973
01:28:10,996 --> 01:28:12,914
I probably wouldn't have.

974
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:15,542
Hey. Hey, no. No.

975
01:28:16,793 --> 01:28:18,462
I totally get it.

976
01:28:31,808 --> 01:28:35,812
I'm sorry I let you get attacked
by a werewolf and then ended the world.

977
01:28:37,647 --> 01:28:38,648
No.

978
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:41,776
Hey, you were right.

979
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:44,696
Humanity...

980
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:54,623
It's time to give someone else a chance.

981
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:09,179
Giant evil gods.

982
01:29:15,519 --> 01:29:16,770
I wish I could've seen them.

983
01:29:17,687 --> 01:29:18,855
I know.

984
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:24,027
That would have been a fun weekend.
