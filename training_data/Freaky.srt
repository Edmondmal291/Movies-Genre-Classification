
1
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:55,247
He moves through this town unseen,
like a ghost,

2
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,459
and he kills at will every year.

3
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:03,714
The Blissfield Butcher started
his reign of terror in 1977,

4
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,966
and it continues to this day.

5
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,759
A geriatric serial killer?

6
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:09,052
Really?

7
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,639
Don't underestimate a straight white man's
propensity for violence, Isaac.

8
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:14,516
I don't care how fucking old they are.

9
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,602
And your story...
it's bullshit, Evan.

10
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:19,566
The Butcher killed some kids,
like, in the '90s,

11
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:21,165
and then 20 years ago, he disappeared.

12
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:22,469
The rest is just local folklore.

13
00:01:22,524 --> 00:01:24,651
Yeah, but didn't the Butcher,
like, also kill

14
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:25,920
a bunch of kids at prom way back when?

15
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,654
Not prom. Homecoming.

16
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,741
All the Blissfield Butcher stories
are centered around homecoming.

17
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,785
And a new legend pops up every year

18
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,954
during homecoming week
to warn Blissfield's teenagers

19
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:38,415
of the dangers of "underage debauchery."

20
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,501
What will this year's story be?

21
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:46,381
Oh, my God, Isaac!

22
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,842
I smell like cheap beer now.

23
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:51,344
Hey, there's some soda water in the bar.
That usually helps.

24
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,657
What is all this shit?

25
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:15,118
Ginny's dad's an art collector.

26
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,621
That's pretty cool.

27
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:21,333
Hmm.

28
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:32,928
Wow.

29
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,807
The fuck's La Dola?

30
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,451
Hey, there's no way to open this thing.

31
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,396
Are you gonna help me or not?

32
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:46,149
Uh, not with that attitude.

33
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:53,407
Mmm-hmm!

34
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,752
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

35
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:57,304
Mon...

36
00:03:57,387 --> 00:04:00,015
Montra... Montrach...

37
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:01,641
Montrachet?

38
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:07,481
Oh, shit.

39
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,818
Yeah, nice one, Sandra.
You made me drop it.

40
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,446
God.

41
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,822
God, they're gonna kill me.

42
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,334
This looks so expensive.

43
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,919
Damn it.

44
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:39,638
You know, you could at least
come down and help me clean this up.

45
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,367
"Not with that attitude."

46
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,952
Whatever, Isaac.

47
00:05:05,747 --> 00:05:07,624
One moment, please.

48
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,172
Aggro-knocking won't
make me move any faster.

49
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,838
Wait. What about me?

50
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,590
You're taking too long.

51
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:59,301
It's a vagina,
not an all-night drive-through.

52
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,928
Can we go three more minutes?
That's all I need.

53
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,722
You know, that's really inconsiderate.

54
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:05,849
Yeah, 'cause guys are
always so considerate.

55
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:06,933
Maybe a handy?

56
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,658
Help!

57
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:27,741
Daddy.

58
00:09:03,402 --> 00:09:05,612
Did you see the car
at the end of the driveway?

59
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:07,114
- No.
- I did.

60
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:09,950
She better not have boys over.

61
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:11,785
Oh, if she does, I'm gonna fucking...

62
00:09:13,578 --> 00:09:15,789
Oh, my God!

63
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,787
Millie, breakfast!

64
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,379
- Good morning.
- Morning.

65
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:06,256
It smells so good.

66
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,092
Banana pancakes, Kessler family recipe.

67
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,260
Mmm.

68
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,035
- I'll take mine to go.
- Hey. No, no, no.

69
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,310
Come sit down.

70
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:20,082
Let's eat like a family for a change.

71
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,022
Family. Right.

72
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,947
See? Isn't this nice?

73
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:33,867
It feels like we hardly ever
do this anymore

74
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,160
since your-your dad...

75
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,787
So, Millie,

76
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:38,890
do you have a date
for homecoming tomorrow?

77
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:41,625
I, um... I'm not... I'm not going.

78
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,001
She has a date with me.

79
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:45,587
We're going to see <i>Wicked</i>
at the Anus Theater.

80
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:47,130
"Ann-is."

81
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,716
Wow.

82
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,801
What?

83
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:51,885
Nothing.

84
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:56,807
It just seems a little weird to miss out
on a seminal high school experience

85
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,017
to go see shit regional theater
with your mom.

86
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,020
Oh, I'm sorry.
Aren't you supposed to discourage her

87
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,271
from things like that?

88
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:06,441
You know it's just underage drinking

89
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:09,361
and God knows what else
that can end in tragedy.

90
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:13,073
Oh, her night is still ending in tragedy.

91
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:14,491
Charlene.

92
00:11:14,783 --> 00:11:17,143
Yeah, I mean, you want to go.
You're excited, right, Millie?

93
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,538
Yeah. Of course.

94
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:27,933
I got to go.
The sheriff says it's urgent.

95
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:46,356
Mmm.

96
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:49,067
Pancakes are really good, Mom.

97
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,820
Oh. Thanks, honey.

98
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:01,705
Keep up, ladies.

99
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,797
Morning, Millie.

100
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,175
Hi, Mr. Daniels.

101
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,885
Say hello.

102
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,971
Hello. You're so cute.

103
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:22,642
I love your black wiener, Mr. Daniels.

104
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,145
Joshua.

105
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:26,688
The dog is black, Nyla.

106
00:12:27,272 --> 00:12:28,398
Let's go far.

107
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:29,900
Oh, my God.

108
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,446
- I-I couldn't.
- Millie, you promised.

109
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,865
I know, but she made me feel so bad.

110
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:39,076
Your mom's superpower is guilt.

111
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,161
Now you're gonna miss the homecoming dance

112
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:43,747
to go watch some hag in green face
hanging from a wire?

113
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,248
Come on. Tit up.

114
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,310
It's just a stupid dance.
Why do you want to go, anyway?

115
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,044
I have to shoot it for yearbook.

116
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:52,190
I'm in it for the drunk straight boys
who will suddenly realize they're fluid.

117
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:54,508
- That sounds kind of rapey.
- Good.

118
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:57,010
Have you seen what's
on the menu in this town?

119
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,573
- Is that the mailman?
- Oh, my God.

120
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:03,058
Welcome to Tragicstan.

121
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:05,018
- And hello.
- Oh, my...

122
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:07,187
Booker is gonna be at the dance.

123
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,272
This is your chance to land that plane.

124
00:13:09,356 --> 00:13:12,109
I'm not landing that plane or any plane.

125
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,319
He hardly knows I exist.

126
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:17,072
Are you serious?
You're a fucking piece, girl.

127
00:13:17,155 --> 00:13:18,907
- Oh, I'm a piece?
- Uh-huh.

128
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,993
Okay, barf choice of words or not,
Joshua's right.

129
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:24,079
You got it, Mill.
You just need to own it.

130
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,123
See? Even Miss Word Police agrees.

131
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,833
You're going. That's final.

132
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:30,961
Hey, Mill, hold on a sec.

133
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:34,506
It's been a year.

134
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:38,051
You can't keep living your life
for someone else.

135
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:40,220
You've got to start doing things for you.

136
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:42,889
Yeah, it's just...

137
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,100
It's not that easy.

138
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:47,853
My dad was her whole world.

139
00:13:47,936 --> 00:13:50,856
I get it. I really do.

140
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:52,500
You don't want to hurt
your mom's feelings.

141
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,693
It's why I love you.

142
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,780
I just... I don't want you
to wake up one morning

143
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:04,077
and realize your whole life passed you by
'cause you were busy being everything

144
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:05,871
to everyone but you.

145
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,168
I'll see you at lunch, okay?

146
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:14,046
- I love you.
- I love you.

147
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,986
Whoo!

148
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:44,034
Millie, hi.

149
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,120
Hi, Ryler.

150
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,873
I love your dress.

151
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,250
- Thanks.
- Where'd you get it?

152
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,753
I... don't know.

153
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,172
I, um... I've had it a long time.

154
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,966
I think I saw it at Discount Bonanza.

155
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:02,552
I had to pee.

156
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:04,262
Did your mom use her employee discount?

157
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,185
Anyway, you look adorbs, seriously.

158
00:15:15,732 --> 00:15:16,983
God.

159
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,375
Oh, my...

160
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:37,879
And I did a common A-frame,

161
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,882
but with delicate detail
to the window framing.

162
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,970
Any dog would kill
to call this their home.

163
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:47,055
If you installed some speakers,

164
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:50,809
threw down a rug,
it'd be the ultimate pooch pad.

165
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,897
Sorry, Mr. Bernardi.

166
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:59,276
- Late again, Miss Kessler.
- It won't happen again.

167
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,820
I doubt that. Just sit down.

168
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,449
It's very nice.

169
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,368
This woodwork is exceptional.

170
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,078
- Thanks, Mr. B.
- Hey.

171
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,914
Pro tip: always set your watch
five minutes ahead.

172
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:14,358
It saves my ass, like, every time.

173
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:16,835
Thanks.

174
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,004
Château Fido.

175
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,756
Come on.

176
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,507
Great work, Phil.

177
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:24,801
Once again, setting the class standard.

178
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,930
Next up is...

179
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:31,892
Oh, Millie Kessler.

180
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:34,478
Time to present your doghouse.

181
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:39,316
Uh, my presentation
isn't scheduled till next week.

182
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,984
This isn't debate class.

183
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:44,488
But you said the 16th.

184
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,990
Um, it's not ready yet.

185
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:53,413
Once again, Miss Kessler
is holding up the class.

186
00:16:53,497 --> 00:16:57,584
And once again,
Miss Kessler is unprepared.

187
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,128
Dick.

188
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:01,797
Something to add, Booker?

189
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,757
Nope.

190
00:17:05,966 --> 00:17:08,887
Can I just... do it the 16th?

191
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,554
Can I just do it the 16th?

192
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:11,639
Speak up.

193
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:18,605
Oh, crocodile tear doesn't excuse
your poor planning, Miss Kessler.

194
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:33,203
My God.

195
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,624
This is completely bonkers.

196
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:39,960
I'm in shock.

197
00:17:40,836 --> 00:17:44,256
I just saw Sandra two days ago in PE.

198
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,674
And now she's...

199
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,593
Oh, my God.
It's a slaughterhouse.

200
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,804
Are you smiling?

201
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,764
Everybody is freaking out.

202
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:54,558
Check it out.

203
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:58,729
<i>Ginny was one of my best friends.</i>

204
00:17:58,895 --> 00:17:59,938
<i>Why?</i>

205
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:01,606
Bitch, please.

206
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,275
Ginny hated Ryler

207
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:05,128
after she started that rumor
about Ginny getting a carrot

208
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,070
- stuck in her pussy.
- Don't say that word.

209
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,031
Whatever. Vagina.

210
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,949
Who would do something like this?

211
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:12,200
The Blissfield Butcher.

212
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,120
He's just an urban legend.
He's not real.

213
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:16,663
Mmm, four very dead teens.

214
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,041
It seems pretty real to me.

215
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:20,724
They're gonna have to cancel homecoming.

216
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:22,252
Please.

217
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,463
Homecoming is like Christmas around here.

218
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,214
They're not canceling it.

219
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,848
Told ya.

220
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:36,391
Hail, hail, Blissfield High!

221
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:38,602
Chomp, chomp, chomp, our battle cry!

222
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:39,829
Yo, guys, check this, check this.

223
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:43,982
When our Beavers come to fight,
feel our glory and our might!

224
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:47,319
Only beaver nobody would touch!

225
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:52,157
I mean, if you brown-bag her face,
she's sort of doable.

226
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:02,667
I smell like orange soda.

227
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,544
It's not that bad.

228
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,422
You should quit.
It is not worth it.

229
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:09,966
Extracurriculars look good
on applications.

230
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,719
As if your mom would ever
let you go away to college.

231
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:14,763
Hey.

232
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,475
She's late. Again.

233
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,144
- You sure you don't want a ride?
- Yeah.

234
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,647
Yeah, she'll be here.
She probably just stopped for gas.

235
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,607
- You want us to wait with you?
- Mmm-mmm.

236
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,735
There is a psycho roaming free.

237
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,445
No.

238
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:32,864
I'm good.
There's plenty of people around.

239
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:34,366
And she'll be here any minute.

240
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,202
I'm good. Just go.

241
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:40,914
Okay.

242
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,837
Bye, Mill.

243
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,047
- Bye. Love you.
- Bye-bye. Love you, poodle.

244
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:51,216
Thank you very much.

245
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,135
- Love you.
- Love you.

246
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:57,264
- Bye.
- Bye!

247
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:25,625
<i>And it's yours, right now, for only 46...</i>

248
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:41,641
Goddamn it.

249
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:47,856
Shit.

250
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:52,569
Hi.

251
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,781
<i>She's passed out on the couch again.</i>

252
00:20:55,864 --> 00:20:57,342
Can you come get...

253
00:20:57,366 --> 00:20:59,159
You've got to be kidding me right now.

254
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:46,140
Please don't be the Butcher.

255
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,404
Please don't be the Butcher.
Please don't be the Butcher.

256
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:56,133
My sister's gonna be here any second!

257
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:57,426
She's a cop!

258
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,098
With a gun!

259
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:17,237
Shit.

260
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:22,701
Help! Help me!

261
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:25,037
Help!

262
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,205
No!

263
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,750
No!

264
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:31,877
No!

265
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,598
No! No!

266
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:12,310
No!

267
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:15,147
No! No! No! No!

268
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,692
No!

269
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:28,869
No!

270
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:44,092
Get away from her!

271
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:50,474
Millie! Millie!

272
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,184
Oh, my God!

273
00:24:53,018 --> 00:24:54,936
6542 to dispatch.

274
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,564
I need an ambulance at my location ASAP!

275
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,150
Hey.

276
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:01,985
You're okay. You're okay.

277
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:04,905
- It hurt him, too.
- You're in shock. It's okay.

278
00:25:04,988 --> 00:25:06,698
- Help's coming, okay?
- It hurt him, too.

279
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:08,217
It's okay. It's okay.
Help's coming.

280
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:09,326
Help's on the way.

281
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,536
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

282
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:24,674
<i>You want us to wait with you?</i>

283
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:27,094
<i>There is a psycho roaming free.</i>

284
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,887
<i>There's plenty of people around.</i>

285
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,305
<i>She'll be here any minute.</i>

286
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:44,653
<i>Millie! Millie!</i>

287
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,571
<i>Oh, my God! What happened?</i>

288
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:48,448
<i>What happened to you?</i>

289
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:51,201
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

290
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:14,975
No, it wasn't my fault!

291
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:17,561
I know.
But I was just coming home.

292
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:20,063
I was gonna sleep until 4:30.

293
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:22,107
I was so tired.
I had one glass of wine.

294
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,876
You did not have one glass of wine!

295
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,700
No, you had an entire bottle
of wine to drink.

296
00:26:25,777 --> 00:26:28,238
- It was one glass of wine!
- Yeah, right.

297
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,343
<i>Sleep till morning.</i>

298
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:52,429
<i>Rest. Sleep.</i>

299
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,017
<i>La Dola.</i>

300
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,234
Hey.

301
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:48,944
Good. You're up.

302
00:27:49,528 --> 00:27:50,987
How are you feeling?

303
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,325
Okay, then.

304
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:58,829
How's your shoulder?

305
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:08,171
You know what?

306
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:10,006
Let's go get manicures after work, huh?

307
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:15,268
Okay, then.
Well, I'm gonna give you a minute.

308
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:19,683
And, uh, I made French toast,
with your favorite:

309
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:22,269
caramelized bananas.

310
00:28:25,731 --> 00:28:26,732
Okay.

311
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,936
Mill, come on.

312
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,938
Food's getting cold.

313
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,546
Where am I?

314
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:34,508
Hello?

315
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:39,137
Oh, my God.
Why do I sound like that?

316
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:08,250
What the fuck? Oh, Jesus.

317
00:30:12,713 --> 00:30:15,048
Okay.
You are just hallucinating.

318
00:30:15,132 --> 00:30:17,467
- Hey! You got any jelly beans?
- I'm sorry.

319
00:30:17,551 --> 00:30:19,391
- Do I have jelly beans?
- You know, ice cubes.

320
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:21,513
Uh, crunch and munch.
You got some drugs, man?

321
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:23,223
Oh, my God.
No, I don't have any drugs.

322
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:24,433
I'm not a drug person.

323
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,759
Uh, may I ask you a question?

324
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:27,477
- What?
- Yeah. Just, you know,

325
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,187
I'm just curious.
What do I look like?

326
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:31,690
Like, when you're seeing me right now?

327
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:34,860
Do I look like a, um, you know,
do I look like a girl?

328
00:30:35,694 --> 00:30:37,154
- Girl?
- Yeah.

329
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:40,699
You know, like, five-foot-five.
Very petite blond.

330
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:43,618
You're fucking lying, man.

331
00:30:43,702 --> 00:30:46,288
You, you, you got drugs.
You're high right now.

332
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:47,598
Oh, no, no.
I don't have the drugs.

333
00:30:47,622 --> 00:30:48,725
Come on, man.
Give me some of those.

334
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:49,892
- That's good stuff.
- Please don't. Please don't.

335
00:30:49,916 --> 00:30:51,477
I want to feel like a teenage girl.
I want to feel like a girl.

336
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,919
I said... Help me!

337
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,172
Come on! Come back! Come back!

338
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:56,798
I'll suck your dick!

339
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:59,092
All of it!

340
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:05,390
<i>I'm here just outside
Blissfield Valley High School,</i>

341
00:31:05,474 --> 00:31:08,101
<i>where a teenage girl
was viciously attacked.</i>

342
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,479
<i>The survivor,
whose name is being withheld...</i>

343
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:12,105
Oh, hey, sweetie.

344
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:14,232
I didn't see you there.

345
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,693
You're like a little ninja.

346
00:31:16,777 --> 00:31:18,278
Come on.

347
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:20,489
Come on, I made you breakfast.

348
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:22,908
Sit, silly.

349
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:24,242
Come on.

350
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,953
Here you go.

351
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:30,248
I really want you to try to eat, okay?

352
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:38,382
Got you some fresh pineapple.

353
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,258
I know how much you love it.

354
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:42,302
It's a good juicy one, too.

355
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,893
Oh.

356
00:31:52,604 --> 00:31:54,106
Mama forgot the syrup.

357
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,651
There you go.

358
00:31:57,734 --> 00:31:59,277
Try to eat something, okay?

359
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:02,197
Mmm.

360
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:05,951
Crispy, like you like it.

361
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:07,285
Mmm.

362
00:32:08,286 --> 00:32:09,454
Mmm.

363
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:12,082
Oh. Oh, my word.

364
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:14,501
Yeah, okay. All right.
I guess you are hungry.

365
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:17,671
Who on earth is...

366
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:23,969
Hey, Mrs. K.

367
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:25,220
Hi, Frank.

368
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:29,725
I was gonna stick this in your box,
but I figured I better check on y'all.

369
00:32:29,808 --> 00:32:31,518
Oh, okay. Well, thank you.

370
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,437
How... how's Millie?

371
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:35,814
I heard. It's just awful.

372
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:37,816
Well...

373
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:41,445
I think she's a little bit in shock,
but she's gonna be okay.

374
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,243
Mom, this house
smells like a fucking Denny's.

375
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,746
Hey.

376
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,873
I thought you were still sleeping.

377
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:58,879
Good morning?

378
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:02,632
Okay.

379
00:33:14,102 --> 00:33:15,687
I got it, sweetie.

380
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:19,524
- Bye.
- Have a good day, honey.

381
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:20,817
- Be safe.
- Thanks, Mom.

382
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,069
Okay.

383
00:33:22,903 --> 00:33:25,697
Honey, I think you should go
and get some more rest.

384
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:30,118
You're not thinking
of going to school, are you?

385
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:32,329
School?

386
00:33:32,412 --> 00:33:35,374
I mean, I know your friends must be
worried about you, but...

387
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:39,211
Friends.

388
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:45,300
<i>The suspect, now identified as</i>

389
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:48,053
<i>Quentin Shermer, escaped
the Avondale Sanatorium,</i>

390
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:51,598
<i>a maximum-security facility
for the criminally insane.</i>

391
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:54,810
<i>Shermer, also known by locals
as the Blissfield Butcher,</i>

392
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:57,229
<i>murdered his mother and infamously left</i>

393
00:33:57,312 --> 00:34:00,524
<i>her severed head
outside a Dairy Queen in 1992.</i>

394
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:29,428
Mr. Daniels?

395
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,555
Mr. Daniels, it's...

396
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,305
Who are you?

397
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,975
- It's okay. Oh!
- Oh!

398
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,309
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

399
00:34:36,392 --> 00:34:37,519
Are you okay?

400
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:38,687
It's you.

401
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,272
- No.
- It's him!

402
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:41,689
It's him!

403
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:34,052
Is that...

404
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:37,389
Does she look cute?

405
00:36:44,855 --> 00:36:47,816
What's with the outfit, Mill?

406
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:51,111
Uh, I can't believe your mom
let you come to school today.

407
00:36:52,362 --> 00:36:53,697
Are you okay?

408
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,907
- Ow.
- Smile for Insta.

409
00:36:57,743 --> 00:37:01,246
Millie, you're Blissfield's victim.
We love you.

410
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:03,331
- Can you not, Ryler?
- Piss off, Ryler.

411
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,916
This is not about you.

412
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,878
Fuck off.

413
00:37:10,422 --> 00:37:13,175
And that police sketch...
of course that guy's a killer.

414
00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:15,594
That gross, bloated,
sweaty face and brown teeth.

415
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:18,472
I mean, I don't think I've ever
seen anyone as hideous as that.

416
00:37:18,555 --> 00:37:20,515
- Take me.
- Uh, where?

417
00:37:22,684 --> 00:37:24,311
Someplace...

418
00:37:25,187 --> 00:37:26,229
private.

419
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,065
Oh, my God.

420
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,751
Something else happened
last night, didn't it?

421
00:37:29,775 --> 00:37:32,295
You can totally tell me.
I'm, like, the most trustworthy person.

422
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:44,122
Smells like hot dog water.

423
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:49,419
Fudge!

424
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,924
I'm a giant. I'm a giant.

425
00:38:06,436 --> 00:38:08,480
Okay. Tell me everything.

426
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,112
Did he...

427
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:17,197
You know.

428
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:21,785
I've seen "SVU." I know the signs.

429
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,290
Uh, hello.

430
00:38:42,848 --> 00:38:44,099
Oh.

431
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:46,977
Wait, are you...

432
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,897
I mean, it's fine if you are.

433
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:58,447
What? Honestly, Millie,
I'm missing AP bio.

434
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,323
I didn't come here to clam-jam with you.

435
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,872
I've had, like, ten kombuchas today,

436
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:09,249
so I'm gonna go pee, and when I get back,

437
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:12,002
you're either spilling the tea or I'm out.

438
00:39:13,462 --> 00:39:14,838
Freak.

439
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:27,601
Hello?

440
00:39:38,487 --> 00:39:39,946
Hello?

441
00:39:53,627 --> 00:39:54,920
Millie?

442
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:21,113
Oh. Oh, my God.

443
00:40:21,196 --> 00:40:22,590
Millie, The Butcher's here.

444
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:25,325
- He's here. We need to go.
- You need to hide.

445
00:40:30,706 --> 00:40:32,457
Wha...

446
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,626
- Are you sure this is safe?
- No.

447
00:40:35,961 --> 00:40:37,087
No!

448
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:40,632
What was that?

449
00:40:40,716 --> 00:40:43,635
Millie! Millie! Millie!

450
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,303
Millie, come back!

451
00:40:45,387 --> 00:40:48,306
Millie! Millie!

452
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:49,933
Millie!

453
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:55,731
Much better.

454
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:24,051
Ryler.

455
00:41:35,979 --> 00:41:38,231
<i>Due to the continued attacks on our students,</i>

456
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:40,567
<i>together with the school board
and Sheriff Larkin,</i>

457
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,861
<i>I have decided to indefinitely postpone</i>

458
00:41:42,944 --> 00:41:44,571
<i>tonight's homecoming dance.</i>

459
00:41:44,654 --> 00:41:46,323
- What?
<i>- City-wide curfew</i>

460
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:48,367
<i>is in effect, starting at 8:00 p.m.</i>

461
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:51,912
<i>As police continue the manhunt
for the Blissfield Butcher...</i>

462
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:53,789
Miss Kessler.

463
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:55,791
I'm speaking to you, Miss Kessler.

464
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:57,376
<i>Stay safe, Beavers.</i>

465
00:42:05,717 --> 00:42:06,760
Hey.

466
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:10,806
Hey, how are you holding up?

467
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,475
Aah!

468
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,321
Hot.

469
00:42:26,863 --> 00:42:28,740
Goddamn it, Millie.

470
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,203
I am so sick of your constant
need for attention.

471
00:42:33,286 --> 00:42:35,414
If only you would spend
a little less time flirting

472
00:42:35,497 --> 00:42:36,641
and a little more time learning,

473
00:42:36,665 --> 00:42:39,209
you might actually
make something out of yourself.

474
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:49,845
- Still nothing?
- I don't think she's coming.

475
00:42:49,928 --> 00:42:50,971
She's acting weird.

476
00:42:51,054 --> 00:42:53,640
She was almost killed last night, Ny.

477
00:42:53,724 --> 00:42:56,309
Maybe we let her be weird for a day.

478
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:57,602
I'm just worried about her.

479
00:42:57,686 --> 00:42:59,730
Nyla, don't freak out.

480
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:02,607
Guys.

481
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:06,653
Guys!

482
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,950
Guys, guys, listen.
It's not what you think.

483
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:14,786
Come on!

484
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:18,623
Balls. I got balls.

485
00:43:21,752 --> 00:43:23,336
- He's still following us!
- Guys!

486
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,048
You're Black! I'm gay!
We are so dead!

487
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,759
Somebody help us, please!

488
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:30,302
Nyla! Josh!

489
00:43:30,385 --> 00:43:32,304
Stop running.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

490
00:43:32,387 --> 00:43:33,513
It's me. It's Millie.

491
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:36,933
- What kind of sick fuck are you?
- How does he know our names?

492
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:39,162
- Stop running, please.
- You stay the fuck away from us!

493
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:41,563
Nyla, will you listen to me for a second?

494
00:43:42,814 --> 00:43:44,094
Fuck!

495
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:47,903
Oh, God, I'm strong.

496
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:51,948
- Come on!
- Nyla, I'm so sorry. Let's just talk.

497
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:54,034
Guys. No, don't, don't!

498
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:56,661
Really?

499
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:00,290
Josh! Guys, stop!
Will you stop, Josh?

500
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:03,335
What, are you nuts?

501
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:06,546
- Ow! Will you stop throwing things at me?
- Josh, get him!

502
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,507
You got to stop!

503
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:11,301
Josh!

504
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:15,222
Guys! Okay, listen to me. Ow!

505
00:44:17,182 --> 00:44:18,725
Stop it! Stop it.

506
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:20,227
Stop it.

507
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,022
Okay. Back up. Back up.

508
00:44:24,106 --> 00:44:25,315
Guys, listen to me.

509
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:26,983
I am not trying to hurt you, okay?

510
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:30,112
If I was, would I drop my weapon?

511
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:31,571
I'm your friend.

512
00:44:34,282 --> 00:44:36,660
Ow! Ow! Ow!

513
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:39,371
Stop hitting me.

514
00:44:39,454 --> 00:44:41,415
Hitting's not okay, Josh.

515
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:42,833
Ow!

516
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,669
Take the shot!

517
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:48,755
- I don't have one!
- Just do it! Just take the...

518
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,015
Okay. Everyone's tired.
We've done lots of hitting.

519
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,184
It's time to talk.

520
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:12,863
Hail, hail, Blissfield High.

521
00:45:12,946 --> 00:45:15,907
Chomp, chomp, chomp's our battle cry.

522
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,326
When our Beavers come to fight,

523
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,495
feel our glory and our might.

524
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:22,956
Yeah?

525
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:29,004
What's your favorite movie?

526
00:45:29,087 --> 00:45:30,630
I tell people it's <i>Eternal Sunshine,</i>

527
00:45:30,714 --> 00:45:31,757
but it's <i>Pitch Perfect 2.</i>

528
00:45:33,508 --> 00:45:35,052
- TV show?
- <i>Sabrina.</i>

529
00:45:37,596 --> 00:45:39,806
- Favorite snack.
- Triple Berry Gushers.

530
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:43,643
Who's your biggest crush?

531
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:48,023
The Booker Hooker.

532
00:45:51,401 --> 00:45:52,652
Shake, bitches.

533
00:45:59,117 --> 00:46:00,494
Right?

534
00:46:00,577 --> 00:46:02,621
- Oh, my God!
- Yes.

535
00:46:03,497 --> 00:46:04,873
Oh, my God.

536
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:07,143
- Wait a minute. How did this happen?
- How is that even possible?

537
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,044
And guess what, I need a friend right now,

538
00:46:09,127 --> 00:46:12,381
and it's like, you guys are
smashing the shit out of me.

539
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,860
He stabbed me with this, like,
weird, old-looking dagger,

540
00:46:15,884 --> 00:46:17,719
but when he stabbed me, we both got hurt.

541
00:46:17,803 --> 00:46:18,804
What do you mean?

542
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:20,806
Standing and peeing is kind of rad.

543
00:46:21,431 --> 00:46:22,766
- Millie, focus.
- Sorry? What?

544
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:26,853
- You both got hurt?
- Oh. Yeah.

545
00:46:26,937 --> 00:46:30,107
So, when he stabbed me,
he instantly got a wound, too,

546
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,734
but in the exact same spot,
the left shoulder.

547
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:34,420
And then, late last night,
I kept hearing

548
00:46:34,444 --> 00:46:35,884
the dagger's name, like, this weird,

549
00:46:35,946 --> 00:46:38,323
like, whispering in my head:
"La Dola, La Dola."

550
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:40,033
I think the Dola caused this.

551
00:46:40,117 --> 00:46:43,995
This is, like, three gallons of pee.
This guy's bladder is huge.

552
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,664
- Is everything huge?
- Joshua.

553
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:48,709
Wha... You know
this is the boys' room, right?

554
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:51,503
She's got a dick in her hand,
and you're wearing Chanel No. 5.

555
00:46:51,586 --> 00:46:54,256
Think we're past labels.

556
00:46:54,339 --> 00:46:55,549
This is ridiculous.

557
00:46:55,632 --> 00:46:58,301
You guys got to see this.
This is like a floppy anteater.

558
00:46:58,385 --> 00:46:59,428
This it?

559
00:47:02,472 --> 00:47:04,182
Yes, that's it.

560
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:05,600
That's the dagger.

561
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:09,229
"La Dola, an ancient Aztecan dagger

562
00:47:09,312 --> 00:47:11,690
"used in ritual sacrifice"?

563
00:47:11,773 --> 00:47:13,608
- Do I wipe?
- There's writing on it.

564
00:47:13,692 --> 00:47:15,819
I think it's Spanish.

565
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:18,447
I can't read it.

566
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,532
Aren't you in Spanish Three?

567
00:47:20,615 --> 00:47:21,700
And your point?

568
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:24,578
You should be able to read Spanish.

569
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:26,830
Nobody pays attention in that class.

570
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:29,041
Why don't we get
Señora Cayenes to translate it?

571
00:47:36,298 --> 00:47:37,591
What does it say?

572
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,065
Uh...

573
00:47:55,817 --> 00:47:58,445
Señor Detmer, you are in my class.

574
00:47:58,528 --> 00:47:59,738
Well, I'm dyslexic.

575
00:48:00,655 --> 00:48:02,032
I have a doctor's note.

576
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:07,746
It says here, if the sacrifice
is not successful,

577
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:09,623
the souls of the two persons are swapped

578
00:48:09,706 --> 00:48:13,960
and the change becomes
<i>permanente</i> after 24 hours.

579
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:15,921
Permanent?

580
00:48:18,006 --> 00:48:19,132
<i>Sí.</i>

581
00:48:25,972 --> 00:48:27,599
Boys are so gross.

582
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,781
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

583
00:48:42,864 --> 00:48:44,366
I'm not a cock gobbler.

584
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:46,868
Hurry up, loser. I got to take a dump.

585
00:48:51,915 --> 00:48:54,418
Uh, I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

586
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:58,422
I... I was... I was looking for,
for someone else. I...

587
00:48:58,505 --> 00:48:59,506
Boo!

588
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:01,091
Boo!

589
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:04,219
How's that feel?

590
00:49:04,302 --> 00:49:05,971
You like being scared?

591
00:49:06,054 --> 00:49:07,931
No. I'm s... I'm sorry.
I di... I thought

592
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:10,809
it was gonna be...

593
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:12,436
Please.

594
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,064
If you ever mess with Millie Kessler

595
00:49:16,148 --> 00:49:19,609
or any other kid again, I swear,

596
00:49:19,693 --> 00:49:24,114
I'll make you wish your buggy,
wormy, stupid face

597
00:49:24,197 --> 00:49:26,283
was never born. Do you got it?

598
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:30,662
Oh, my God.
Did you just pee yourself?

599
00:49:30,746 --> 00:49:32,122
- Yes!
- Ew!

600
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:34,624
That's disgusting.

601
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,335
So you're saying if I don't
stab him with the Dola

602
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:39,499
by midnight, I'm gonna be stuck
in this body forever?

603
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:41,173
- Yep.
- That's in, like, nine hours.

604
00:49:41,256 --> 00:49:44,259
- Uh, it's doable. Adjacent.
- Where's the Dola?

605
00:49:44,342 --> 00:49:46,112
It's at the police station
in the evidence locker.

606
00:49:46,136 --> 00:49:48,889
Then we better get going over there now.

607
00:49:48,972 --> 00:49:52,225
Guys, he's here somewhere.

608
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:54,394
And he's wearing my body
and he's wearing my face.

609
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:57,147
He's like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

610
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,815
And if we don't capture him first,

611
00:50:00,942 --> 00:50:02,903
God knows how many people he's gonna kill.

612
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:04,905
What kind of a name is that?

613
00:50:05,822 --> 00:50:07,115
Stupid name.

614
00:50:12,454 --> 00:50:13,663
Miss Kessler.

615
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,292
You got some nerve
stepping back in this classroom.

616
00:50:37,479 --> 00:50:39,272
I'm not here for your games.

617
00:50:43,402 --> 00:50:44,569
Turn that off!

618
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:52,035
No!

619
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,040
Ah!

620
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:05,924
Self-defense. I had to do it.

621
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:09,302
I'll see you in the principal's office.

622
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,587
That's what you get
for fucking with me, missy.

623
00:52:33,345 --> 00:52:35,097
Ma'am.

624
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:42,938
Fuck off, piggies.

625
00:52:43,021 --> 00:52:44,499
- Is this where he is?
- Yeah.

626
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:46,358
He'll be getting out of woodshop.

627
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:50,946
Whoa. What am I wearing?

628
00:52:52,698 --> 00:52:53,907
Stop right there.

629
00:52:54,616 --> 00:52:58,495
Help! Help! Oh, my God!
It's the Blissfield Butcher!

630
00:52:58,578 --> 00:52:59,746
- Help me! Help!
- Freeze!

631
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:02,666
- Run!
- Please help! It's him!

632
00:53:05,544 --> 00:53:07,814
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Where's the car?

633
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:10,173
- Run!
- Hurry! Hurry!

634
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:13,051
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Get in the car!

635
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:18,390
What's wrong with it?

636
00:53:18,473 --> 00:53:20,076
It's a piece of shit!
What do you want from me?

637
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,476
Uh, guys...

638
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,104
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hurry!

639
00:53:24,187 --> 00:53:25,772
- Go. Go. Go now.
- Go, go!

640
00:53:25,856 --> 00:53:28,400
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Watch out!

641
00:53:33,238 --> 00:53:35,824
Suspect-suspect spotted in a shit heap!

642
00:53:35,907 --> 00:53:37,093
Headed west from the high school!

643
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:39,578
Why can't I just have a normal life?

644
00:53:39,661 --> 00:53:41,541
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down, Nyla.

645
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:43,331
I just turned 18.
I could go to prison.

646
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:45,351
Nyla, can you scooch your seat
up just a little bit?

647
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:47,002
Okay, we need a plan.

648
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:49,313
They saw us with her,
so they're gonna be looking for us now.

649
00:53:49,337 --> 00:53:52,108
- Ny, can you move up a little more?
- We need to get you a disguise, Mill.

650
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:54,193
You can't be walking around in
those clothes with that face.

651
00:53:54,217 --> 00:53:55,611
- Everyone knows who you are.
- Good plan.

652
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:58,346
Nyla, could you just do
just a little, teeny, teeny,

653
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,265
teeny, teeny, just a little bit more?

654
00:54:00,348 --> 00:54:03,727
- You good, Mill?
- Yeah. Much better.

655
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,538
Suspect spotted with two youths.

656
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:09,149
Teenagers. One Black, female,
one white, uh, excited.

657
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:10,992
Heading towards
the northwest corner of town.

658
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,987
Hey, what the fuck?
Are you kidding me?

659
00:54:17,908 --> 00:54:18,950
Shit.

660
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:20,660
- What?
- It's the police.

661
00:54:23,288 --> 00:54:25,624
- Oh, my God. It's Char.
- Um...

662
00:54:27,209 --> 00:54:28,752
Ooh! Up ahead, turn left.

663
00:54:28,835 --> 00:54:30,855
- We can mix into the parking lot.
- No, that's my mom's...

664
00:54:30,879 --> 00:54:33,340
- It's our best chance! Go!
- Turn!

665
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,972
Holy shit!

666
00:54:41,056 --> 00:54:42,182
Come on!

667

- Shit.
- Let's go.

Go. Go, go, go, go, go.

674
00:55:16,758 --> 00:55:18,385
Millie, hide in here. Quick.

675
00:55:19,428 --> 00:55:21,054
Do not come out until we get you.

- Sorry. So sorry.

00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:37,463
I didn't know anybody was in there.

- No problem. Okay.

682
00:55:38,947 --> 00:55:40,032
You all good in there?

683
00:55:40,115 --> 00:55:41,783
Yeah, uh, uh, great, actually.

684
00:55:41,867 --> 00:55:43,094
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sure, sure.

685
00:55:43,118 --> 00:55:46,371
Just, uh, trying on, uh, polos.

686
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:48,206
Wow.

687
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:52,419
I happen to be a professional
at helping men pick out polos.

688
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:54,004
- What do you say?
- Nope.

689
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:56,006
- No, actually, I'm all good.
- Don't be silly.

690
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:59,009
Everybody needs a second opinion.
How is the fit?

691
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:01,678
Because we have lots of sizes here.

692
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:03,805
Oh, you know what?
It's so funny.

693
00:56:03,889 --> 00:56:08,518
I bought my husband a pink polo
one year for Christmas,

694
00:56:08,602 --> 00:56:12,939
and he about died.
"Pink?" He's so macho.

695
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:15,650
But guess what.
It looked great on him.

696
00:56:17,402 --> 00:56:19,696
Brought out his eyes.

697
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,783
He had these... these blue eyes.

698
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:25,702
I bet he loved it.

699
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,165
I bet it was his favorite shirt.

700
00:56:32,959 --> 00:56:34,503
He passed away a year ago.

701
00:56:36,797 --> 00:56:39,132
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

702
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,886
Listen to me.
Debbie Downer. I'm sorry.

703
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:44,888
I didn't mean to share all that with you.

704
00:56:44,971 --> 00:56:48,058
I just... You're just...
You're trying to buy a polo,

705
00:56:48,141 --> 00:56:50,352
- for God's sake. I...
- No, no, no, no. No.

706
00:56:50,435 --> 00:56:52,979
No, it's okay. It's okay.

707
00:56:53,063 --> 00:56:56,525
I, um... I lost somebody, too.

708
00:56:56,608 --> 00:56:58,193
- Really?
- Yeah.

709
00:57:01,154 --> 00:57:03,156
- I lost my dad.
- I'm so sorry.

710
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:06,952
You must miss him so much.

711
00:57:07,536 --> 00:57:09,663
Yeah, I do.

712
00:57:09,746 --> 00:57:14,543
Nothing prepares you
for this stuff, right?

713
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:17,963
I mean, we're all just left here...

714
00:57:19,256 --> 00:57:22,509
...to pick up the pieces and...

715
00:57:22,592 --> 00:57:26,096
My oldest, she shut down.
She retreated into work.

716
00:57:26,179 --> 00:57:30,726
And my other daughter, Millie,
she's so quiet now.

717
00:57:31,935 --> 00:57:34,855
I can't figure out
what's going on inside her head.

718
00:57:35,313 --> 00:57:38,817
Maybe she just needs some... some space.

719
00:57:42,154 --> 00:57:43,905
Just some time to figure out who she is.

720
00:57:44,781 --> 00:57:46,033
Yeah.

721
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:49,786
I guess I do smother her.

722
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:54,750
I don't mean to. But I am scared.

723
00:57:55,584 --> 00:57:56,853
She'll be graduating high school

724
00:57:56,877 --> 00:58:00,630
and running off to college,
and then I'll be left here.

725
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,303
All by myself.

726
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,580
But that-that's never gonna happen.

727
00:58:11,516 --> 00:58:13,769
She's your daughter, and...

728
00:58:15,896 --> 00:58:17,022
...she loves you.

729
00:58:19,816 --> 00:58:21,109
Thank you for that.

730
00:58:21,568 --> 00:58:24,738
- You're so easy to talk to.
- Yeah, you're great. You're just...

731
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,825
Your voice, it's so... comforting

732
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:31,787
and... very manly.

733
00:58:33,413 --> 00:58:35,916
I know this is awkward, uh, but...

734
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:38,686
I've had such a good time talking to you.

735
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,313
- Yeah, it's been...
- We hardly know each other.

736
00:58:40,337 --> 00:58:41,505
- I know, I know.
- Yeah.

737
00:58:41,588 --> 00:58:43,465
And I, I haven't even seen you yet

738
00:58:43,548 --> 00:58:46,968
but I think we have a connection, and...

739
00:58:47,052 --> 00:58:49,971
I would like to know
if maybe you would like to

740
00:58:50,055 --> 00:58:51,807
grab a coffee with me sometime.

741
00:58:53,517 --> 00:58:55,227
Ew. God, no.

742
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:59,689
- No, I wouldn't, um...
- I should never have asked you.

743
00:58:59,773 --> 00:59:02,210
- That was totally inappropriate.
- And so what I'm saying is,

744
00:59:02,234 --> 00:59:04,111
you know, um, "Oh, no."

745
00:59:04,194 --> 00:59:06,321
Like, I've missed out
because we've had a connection.

746
00:59:06,405 --> 00:59:07,572
You share so beautiful.

747
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:10,659
And I just would love to do
more than a coffee.

748
00:59:11,368 --> 00:59:14,371
Um, even, even, have a dinner?

749
00:59:14,454 --> 00:59:17,165
- Oh. Dinner?
- Yeah, I would love that,

750
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:19,084
'cause I feel like
we know each other so well.

751
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,354
- You know what I mean? So it's like...
- I feel that, too.

752
00:59:21,378 --> 00:59:24,005
A coffee wouldn't be enough for us.
But I'm married.

753
00:59:24,923 --> 00:59:26,842
- Oh.
- So I'm a married man.

754
00:59:26,925 --> 00:59:28,343
- Mom!
- What?

755
00:59:28,427 --> 00:59:29,654
Have you talked to Millie today?

756
00:59:29,678 --> 00:59:31,155
- No, I haven't.
- Okay. Where's your phone?

757
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:32,490
- No, it's in my purse.
- Go get it.

758
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:34,075
- Call her and make sure she's okay.
- I will!

759
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:35,459
The killer was just sighted again.

760
00:59:35,517 --> 00:59:37,644
- Go. Let's go. Come on.
- Good luck to you!

761
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:45,944
What the hell is that?

762
00:59:46,028 --> 00:59:48,238
Quick, put it on.
You're scary Aaron Rodgers now.

763
00:59:49,114 --> 00:59:50,216
- Who?
- Famous quarterback.

764
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,825
- Green Bay Packers.
- Even I know that.

765
00:59:51,908 --> 00:59:53,326
You know I hate sports.

766
00:59:56,413 --> 00:59:57,998
This is terrifying.
I can't breathe.

767
00:59:58,081 --> 01:00:00,184
It's all we had time to grab.
Your sister's on our ass.

768
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:01,460
- Let's go.
- Come on.

769
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,796
I can't see shit.

770
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,923
How do killers do this?

771
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:08,800
Nyla, drive.

772
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:10,218
I'm trolling Insta.

773
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:11,821
Somebody's got to know
where The Butcher is.

774
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:13,388
Got it.

775
01:00:14,347 --> 01:00:16,058
Oh! Fuck!

776
01:00:20,145 --> 01:00:22,773
Oh! Sorry.
Oh, that's your face. Okay.

777
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:24,542
Okay, I'm getting this off.
I can't see anything.

778
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:26,002
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop.

779
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:28,487
If you get recognized, we are screwed.

780
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:30,072
- Bingo.
- Oh, my God. What?

781
01:00:30,155 --> 01:00:31,507
- Suffocating. Who's this one?
- Mill.

782
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:33,801
- Which one's who? Who's that?
<i>- Coming at you live,</i>

783
01:00:33,825 --> 01:00:37,371
<i>Blissfield's unofficial homecoming queen.</i>

784
01:00:41,792 --> 01:00:42,834
This sucks.

785
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:45,646
- I want to party.
- We should throw our own homecoming.

786
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:47,506
- Fuck The Butcher.
- Okay, sure.

787
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:49,870
And where are we gonna pull that off
with Larkin's curfew?

788
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:51,468
The old mill.

789
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,012
No one would look there.

790
01:00:55,097 --> 01:00:57,349
- Hell yeah. That's genius.
- Not bad.

791
01:00:57,516 --> 01:01:01,061
Who knew little Millie Kessler
could be such a crafty beaver?

792
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,400
Your touch makes this pussy
drier than sandpaper,

793
01:01:06,483 --> 01:01:07,943
you fucking monkey.

794
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,697
I can't wait to kill you.

795
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:20,914
She fucking wants me.

796
01:01:32,008 --> 01:01:33,844
I'm gonna take a piss.

797
01:01:33,927 --> 01:01:35,429
Okay. Sure.

798
01:01:40,684 --> 01:01:42,519
Okay, I'll go check the back.

799
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:43,770
Okay.

800
01:01:45,731 --> 01:01:47,107
Oh, my God.

801
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,381
- He's gonna kill him.
- What?

802
01:01:53,405 --> 01:01:56,408
- He's gonna kill him!
- I literally can't understand you.

803
01:01:56,491 --> 01:01:58,994
Here. Divide and survive.
You go that way.

804
01:02:16,303 --> 01:02:17,721
Hey.

805
01:02:20,098 --> 01:02:21,141
Hey, Millie.

806
01:02:22,225 --> 01:02:23,643
Where'd you go?

807
01:02:27,397 --> 01:02:28,523
Millie?

808
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,572
Booker?

809
01:02:39,034 --> 01:02:40,285
Booker?

810
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:49,044
Fucking...

811
01:03:04,267 --> 01:03:06,436
Oh!

812
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:10,065
I fucking hate this place.

813
01:03:32,879 --> 01:03:34,297
Hey, Millie?

814
01:03:35,966 --> 01:03:37,509
Hey, where are you?

815
01:03:40,137 --> 01:03:41,888
I just w... I just want to talk.

816
01:03:44,307 --> 01:03:45,517
Make sure you're okay.

817
01:03:54,067 --> 01:03:55,402
Booker!

818
01:03:59,823 --> 01:04:00,866
Oh, my God.

819
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,286
Don't let him get away!
He'll call the cops!

820
01:04:05,454 --> 01:04:07,873
Help! Help! Help!

821
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,713
Oh, my God.

822
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:22,387
Where the hell did you learn
how to do that?

823
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:24,890
Dad was an Eagle Scout.

824
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:27,184
Found these.

825
01:04:29,352 --> 01:04:30,395
Ah.

826
01:04:35,817 --> 01:04:38,028
Uh-huh. Okay.

827
01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:47,662
He's even gorgeous when he's unconscious.

828
01:04:58,715 --> 01:05:00,050
- Hey.
- Jesus Chr...

829
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:01,676
Easy, easy, easy.

830
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,637
It's okay. It's okay.

831
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,306
Look, I know I look like
The Butcher, but it's Millie.

832
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,310
- This is gonna sound really strange.
- Booker.

833
01:05:10,394 --> 01:05:12,270
Booker, look at me. He's crazy.

834
01:05:12,354 --> 01:05:14,106
Okay.
Booker, can you look at me, please?

835
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:16,233
Please. Booker, please.
Can you look at me?

836
01:05:16,316 --> 01:05:17,526
Just for a second?

837
01:05:17,609 --> 01:05:20,654
Okay, so last night,
our consciousness or our spirit,

838
01:05:20,737 --> 01:05:22,280
whatever you want to call it...

839
01:05:22,364 --> 01:05:23,699
Okay? It traded places.

840
01:05:23,782 --> 01:05:26,284
- She's telling the truth.
- So, he stabbed me with the Dola,

841
01:05:26,368 --> 01:05:28,954
which is, like,
this ancient mystical dagger.

842
01:05:29,037 --> 01:05:31,248
And now I have, like, less than
six hours to swap back,

843
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,083
or I'm gonna be stuck in his body forever.

844
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:36,086
You're all going to jail for this.
You, too, Booker.

845
01:05:36,169 --> 01:05:38,588
Unless you help me. Booker.

846
01:05:38,672 --> 01:05:41,883
- Dry up, bitch.
- Booker, help! Booker!

847
01:05:41,967 --> 01:05:44,177
- Will you shut up?
- Booker.

848
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:47,139
Look, I know this is crazy, okay?
And there's a lot of voices competing.

849
01:05:47,222 --> 01:05:48,902
You see my friends,
you know Nyla and Josh,

850
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:50,868
and they're on my side, okay?
And this is clearly not me.

851
01:05:50,892 --> 01:05:52,286
Have you ever seen me dressed like that?

852
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:54,980
I mean, I kind of like
a lot of what he's doing

853
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:57,333
with it, but it's... The point
is that you've never seen me

854
01:05:57,357 --> 01:05:59,037
dressed like that, right?
Do you like that?

855
01:05:59,067 --> 01:06:01,379
It doesn't matter. Like, look,
I'm giving you a lot of information,

856
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:02,779
and you literally just woke up.

857
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,615
Whew. You look great.

858
01:06:06,616 --> 01:06:08,720
- I need to get out of here.
- Booker. Booker, please.

859
01:06:08,744 --> 01:06:10,555
- Please. Please, Booker.
- No, I need to go right now.

860
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:12,306
You're not gonna stop me.
I'm gonna freak out, okay?

861
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,623
"I'm not yours,

862
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:15,292
"not lost in you.

863
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:18,378
"Not lost, although I long to be.

864
01:06:20,756 --> 01:06:23,675
"Lost as a candle lit at noon.

865
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:27,971
"Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

866
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:32,559
"You love me, and I find you

867
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:37,189
"still a spirit, beautiful and bright.

868
01:06:38,106 --> 01:06:39,816
"Yet I am, who long to be

869
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:44,946
"lost as light is lost in light.

870
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,576
"Plunge me deep into love.

871
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,121
"Put away my senses.

872
01:06:53,205 --> 01:06:54,790
"Leave me deaf and blind,

873
01:06:56,249 --> 01:06:58,960
"swept by the tempest of your love...

874
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:03,006
"...a taper...

875
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:06,593
in the rushing wind."

876
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,346
How?

877
01:07:11,056 --> 01:07:12,682
I told you it was a curse.

878
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:15,143
Um...

879
01:07:15,894 --> 01:07:17,104
What the hell was that?

880
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:21,066
A few weeks ago,
I found a poem in my locker.

881
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,486
It was anonymous.

882
01:07:25,946 --> 01:07:28,323
I don't know why I did it.
I just was...

883
01:07:29,991 --> 01:07:31,868
You know, it was...

884
01:07:32,744 --> 01:07:33,954
It was just stupid.

885
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,750
You sad fucking cunt.

886
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:44,923
A poem in his locker?

887
01:07:46,216 --> 01:07:49,636
You pathetic coward.

888
01:07:56,143 --> 01:08:00,522
- That's quite enough of that.
- This should be his new mug shot.

889
01:08:00,605 --> 01:08:02,149
Mmm.

890
01:08:02,232 --> 01:08:04,609
Stop messing around.

891
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:11,408
So the Dola's here at the station.

892
01:08:11,491 --> 01:08:13,291
We're gonna have to figure out
how to steal it

893
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:14,411
and then get it back here.

894
01:08:14,494 --> 01:08:15,953
That's, like, 40 minutes round-trip.

895
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:19,583
There's plenty of time, right?

896
01:08:19,666 --> 01:08:21,436
Uh, that's assuming
there's someone at the station.

897
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,543
Hmm.

898
01:08:22,627 --> 01:08:24,796
I mean, with them looking for us
and the party tonight,

899
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,922
- the cops could have their hands full.
- Hmm.

900
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,967
- Where's the party?
- It's at the old mill.

901
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:31,136
That's where I woke up in this body.

902
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:34,681
He's luring them there.
That's a trap.

903
01:08:34,765 --> 01:08:37,266
- Then we better get moving.
- And what about her?

904
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:39,311
- Pronouns.
- Christ, what about him?

905
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:40,996
My mom's out of town until Monday.

906
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,620
Yeah.
No, I don't think it's a good idea

907
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:44,375
- to leave him here alone.
- No, he's right.

908
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:46,169
Someone needs to stay behind
and keep an eye on him

909
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:48,153
- just in case.
- Mmm-hmm.

910
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:54,034
- What? Me?
- It's your house.

911
01:08:54,117 --> 01:08:55,219
Definitely gonna die this time.

912
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:56,744
Chill out. You'll be fine.

913
01:09:00,165 --> 01:09:01,625
Wait. Wait, guys.

914
01:09:03,418 --> 01:09:05,295
Great.

915
01:09:05,378 --> 01:09:07,005
Leave me alone with Murder Barbie.

916
01:09:17,474 --> 01:09:18,850
Okay, guys. He's gone.

917
01:09:20,685 --> 01:09:23,355
- That's Char's car.
- You guys stay here.

918
01:09:23,438 --> 01:09:25,524
Honk the horn twice
if you see anything, okay?

919
01:09:25,607 --> 01:09:27,650
What's your plan?

920
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:29,653
Don't worry about it.

921
01:09:29,735 --> 01:09:31,320
I got this. Yeah.

922
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:41,248
I've never been so stressed and excited
at the same time in my life.

923
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:44,333
Hashtag "stress-cited."

924
01:09:46,253 --> 01:09:47,796
Hashtag "nerves of steel."

925
01:09:49,464 --> 01:09:51,216
Hashtag "What's she doing?"

926
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,969
Oh, my God. Char, help me!

927
01:09:54,052 --> 01:09:56,263
Nyla. What the hell is going on?

928
01:09:56,346 --> 01:09:57,848
You were spotted with The Butcher.

929
01:09:57,931 --> 01:09:59,766
He kidnapped us.
He made us drive him. I...

930
01:10:00,642 --> 01:10:02,561
I escaped, but he followed me here.

931
01:10:03,061 --> 01:10:04,664
- Wait. He's here?
- Outside, behind the station.

932
01:10:04,688 --> 01:10:07,190
Okay, okay.
Just, just stay here, okay?

933
01:10:07,274 --> 01:10:08,334
- Hide under my desk.
- Okay.

934
01:10:08,358 --> 01:10:09,526
Go! Go, go, go!

935
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:16,408
That's so crazy.

936
01:10:17,576 --> 01:10:21,246
But, you know, I have to admit,
in a really strange way,

937
01:10:21,329 --> 01:10:23,165
that it hasn't been all bad.

938
01:10:23,248 --> 01:10:24,608
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

939
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:26,418
It's just, you know,

940
01:10:27,461 --> 01:10:29,921
I felt oddly empowered being in this body.

941
01:10:31,339 --> 01:10:33,633
Like, invincible

942
01:10:33,717 --> 01:10:35,761
or kind of badass.

943
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,473
I know. It's, um...

944
01:10:39,556 --> 01:10:41,933
I mean, it's ridiculous, but, uh...

945
01:10:42,893 --> 01:10:44,770
I guess when you're, uh...

946
01:10:45,437 --> 01:10:48,106
When you're someone like me and you,

947
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:51,610
you know, you've been bullied
most of your life

948
01:10:51,693 --> 01:10:55,572
and, you know, sort of
just put down a lot, that,

949
01:10:55,655 --> 01:10:58,825
you know, it does feel kind of good to

950
01:10:59,993 --> 01:11:01,995
just feel strong for once.

951
01:11:04,039 --> 01:11:05,874
Strength doesn't come from size.

952
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,835
It doesn't.
It comes from up here

953
01:11:09,878 --> 01:11:11,171
and in there.

954
01:11:11,254 --> 01:11:14,049
And you are a lot stronger than you think.

955
01:11:16,802 --> 01:11:19,596
<i>- Hello.
- Oh, whoa! Oh!</i>

956
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:21,515
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

957
01:11:26,353 --> 01:11:28,855
<i>- Oh, my God.
- What happened?</i>

958
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:30,416
<i>- Luann, are you okay?
- This one's a live one.</i>

959
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,275
<i>- I know. Hold on.
- Are you okay?</i>

960
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:34,569
That nasty stare does not scare me.

961
01:11:34,653 --> 01:11:36,733
<i>He just started trying to buck me off.</i>

962
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:39,616
<i>The Blissfield Rotary Club presents...</i>

963
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:43,537
- Ha.
- ...WICKED <i>live at the Anis Theater.</i>

964
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:46,498
<i>Get your tickets before they fly away.</i>

965
01:11:46,581 --> 01:11:48,417
<i>Ladies, we've all been there.</i>

966
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,585
- Just...
- <i>Can't get those corns...</i>

967
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:52,230
- ...don't move.
- <i>...into that new pair of shoes?</i>

968
01:11:52,254 --> 01:11:54,548
<i>Well, introducing Corn Erase.</i>

969
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:56,299
<i>You apply the cream all over the bunion,</i>

970
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:58,343
<i>and within minutes,
the deep-penetrating...</i>

971
01:12:02,347 --> 01:12:04,349
Hello!

972
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:07,477
Joshy!

973
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,897
Josh.

974
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:13,400
Hi, Mom.

975
01:12:13,483 --> 01:12:15,152
You're home early.

976
01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:16,778
My last flight got canceled.

977
01:12:16,862 --> 01:12:20,198
Honey, why is Millie
tied to my dining chair?

978
01:12:20,282 --> 01:12:22,325
Um, she...

979
01:12:24,036 --> 01:12:25,328
We, um,

980
01:12:26,246 --> 01:12:27,247
role-play.

981
01:12:28,707 --> 01:12:30,500
- Mmm?
- I'm sorry?

982
01:12:31,126 --> 01:12:33,295
- We're role-playing.
- Role-playing?

983
01:12:33,378 --> 01:12:35,088
Yes, role-playing.

984
01:12:35,797 --> 01:12:37,257
- Like a game?
- Sort of.

985
01:12:39,259 --> 01:12:41,553
She doesn't look like
she's enjoying herself.

986
01:12:41,636 --> 01:12:42,888
- No.
- Oh.

987
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:44,806
Oh, um, that, that's the point.

988
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,725
She's, she's supposed to act upset.

989
01:12:48,185 --> 01:12:49,519
Right, Millie?

990
01:12:50,854 --> 01:12:52,773
She's method.
Never breaks character.

991
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:55,692
Naughty girl!

992
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:00,840
<i>He's eating my bracelet!</i>

993
01:13:00,864 --> 01:13:02,574
I'm a little confused.

994
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:05,869
Isn't role-playing...

995
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:08,205
...a sex game?

996
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:11,750
- Is it?
- Mmm-hmm.

997
01:13:14,002 --> 01:13:15,379
Yes. Yes, it is.

998
01:13:15,462 --> 01:13:16,546
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

999
01:13:17,047 --> 01:13:18,048
So...

1000
01:13:18,799 --> 01:13:19,966
Okay, um,

1001
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:24,346
Mom, I didn't want to tell you
until I was ready,

1002
01:13:27,724 --> 01:13:28,725
but I'm straight.

1003
01:13:33,522 --> 01:13:36,149
Joshua, you are many things,
but straight isn't one of them.

1004
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:38,276
Now, do me a favor and untie her.

1005
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,653
- I can't.
- Joshua!

1006
01:13:39,736 --> 01:13:40,987
Mom, I'm sorry.

1007
01:13:41,071 --> 01:13:42,924
I can't explain right now,
but I cannot let him go.

1008
01:13:42,948 --> 01:13:44,116
- "Him"?
- No. Mom.

1009
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:45,367
Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

1010
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:46,660
He's the Blissfield Butcher!

1011
01:13:46,743 --> 01:13:48,787
God! Joshua Michael Detmer,

1012
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:51,373
I've been slinging peanuts
to assholes all week.

1013
01:13:51,456 --> 01:13:52,517
I don't have time for this.

1014
01:13:52,541 --> 01:13:53,875
No. Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, don't.

1015
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:55,419
How did you even do this? Ow!

1016
01:13:56,253 --> 01:13:57,379
Run!

1017
01:14:01,633 --> 01:14:04,010
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1018
01:14:12,227 --> 01:14:13,705
No, no, no, no, no!
Go for the windows!

1019
01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:15,089
- Make sure they're locked!
- Okay!

1020
01:14:30,328 --> 01:14:32,330
- What?
- Nyla, he's escaped!

1021
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:33,415
What?

1022
01:14:33,498 --> 01:14:35,667
Body's fucking useless!

1023
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:41,757
I couldn't find him.
Are you sure he followed you?

1024
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,425
Yes, I'm sure he did.
I swear he...

1025
01:14:43,508 --> 01:14:45,302
He took us, and, and...

1026
01:14:45,385 --> 01:14:46,428
Nyla.

1027
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:50,807
What the fuck is going on?

1028
01:14:53,143 --> 01:14:55,103
Don't you dare answer that.

1029
01:14:57,189 --> 01:15:00,317
- I can explain.
- Nyla, this is serious.

1030
01:15:01,818 --> 01:15:04,237
- Put your hands up.
- Please, just let me explain.

1031
01:15:04,321 --> 01:15:06,114
Hands up! Now!

1032
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:13,163
I want you to slowly set the weapon down.

1033
01:15:18,752 --> 01:15:19,753
Now kick it over to me.

1034
01:15:23,465 --> 01:15:25,509
Hey, do you mind if I come back there?

1035
01:15:27,761 --> 01:15:29,763
- Sure.
- Yeah?

1036
01:15:33,183 --> 01:15:34,351
My God.

1037
01:15:37,604 --> 01:15:39,356
Right. I felt so far away.

1038
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:46,196
- Hmm.
- So,

1039
01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:49,241
- about that poem...
- Oh, my gosh.

1040
01:15:49,324 --> 01:15:51,493
Please don't bring that up.
That was a total mistake.

1041
01:15:51,576 --> 01:15:53,537
That was a mistake?

1042
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:54,860
What? You accidentally wrote it

1043
01:15:54,913 --> 01:15:57,392
and you were just going by my locker,
and you tripped, and it fell in?

1044
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:59,376
Yes, exactly. That's what happened.

1045
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:03,964
Well, I thought it was beautiful.

1046
01:16:04,047 --> 01:16:05,298
The poem.

1047
01:16:06,299 --> 01:16:08,260
Probably read it, like, a hundred times.

1048
01:16:08,343 --> 01:16:09,469
Really?

1049
01:16:10,345 --> 01:16:14,015
Yeah. I mean, once I got over
how creepy it was finding it, yeah.

1050
01:16:16,101 --> 01:16:17,686
- Sorry.
- I'm kidding.

1051
01:16:20,105 --> 01:16:22,858
I actually kind of hoped
that it was your poem.

1052
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:25,902
No, you didn't.

1053
01:16:28,655 --> 01:16:30,157
Millie,

1054
01:16:31,324 --> 01:16:33,118
I've liked you since day one.

1055
01:16:37,664 --> 01:16:39,332
You don't have to say that.

1056
01:16:40,250 --> 01:16:42,461
I know I don't. That's why I did.

1057
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:53,513
How weird is it that I kind of feel like
kissing you right now?

1058
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:06,651
Technically,

1059
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:10,572
you'd be kissing a mass murderer
with yellow teeth.

1060
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:14,534
You're still Millie to me.

1061
01:17:23,919 --> 01:17:25,438
Maybe we should wait for when my hand's

1062
01:17:25,462 --> 01:17:27,148
- not bigger than your whole face.
- Yeah. No, no, no.

1063
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:29,341
That's okay. That's...
It's, it's whenever you want.

1064
01:17:30,008 --> 01:17:31,426
I'm not going anywhere.

1065
01:17:39,434 --> 01:17:40,644
Fuck!

1066
01:17:42,187 --> 01:17:44,314
Millie, where the fuck have you been?

1067
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:46,316
- I have been calling you all day.
- What?

1068
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:48,402
I've been calling you, too.

1069
01:17:48,485 --> 01:17:51,113
- That is not your sister.
- Nyla, shut the fuck up.

1070
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:52,197
Okay.

1071
01:17:52,698 --> 01:17:54,157
What is going on here?

1072
01:17:54,241 --> 01:17:55,617
Millie, stay out of this.

1073
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:57,762
- I'm just trying to help.
- I don't need your help, okay?

1074
01:17:57,786 --> 01:17:59,097
- I'm just trying to help!
- I don't need your fucking help.

1075
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:00,205
Back the fuck up.

1076
01:18:01,123 --> 01:18:02,124
Char!

1077
01:18:05,293 --> 01:18:06,294
Run, Millie!

1078
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:08,338
Get your hands up.
Hands up now!

1079
01:18:11,007 --> 01:18:14,511
Come on, Nyla.
Pick up the fucking phone!

1080
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:18,974
Charlene.

1081
01:18:19,057 --> 01:18:20,684
Charlene! Charlene!

1082
01:18:20,767 --> 01:18:22,394
Over here! Charlene!

1083
01:18:23,103 --> 01:18:24,146
Oh, my God!

1084
01:18:25,564 --> 01:18:27,190
Start walking towards the cell.

1085
01:18:28,066 --> 01:18:29,151
Come on!

1086
01:18:34,531 --> 01:18:36,491
- Can you listen to me?
- Now!

1087
01:18:43,457 --> 01:18:44,958
Nyla, don't you fucking move!

1088
01:18:57,721 --> 01:18:58,889
Get in.

1089
01:18:58,972 --> 01:19:01,016
- Can you please listen to me?
- Move!

1090
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:04,019
Hey!

1091
01:19:06,313 --> 01:19:07,731
- No!
- I'm so sorry.

1092
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:09,441
- Oh, my God! No!
- Char, I'm so sorry.

1093
01:19:09,524 --> 01:19:10,525
No!

1094
01:19:11,693 --> 01:19:13,820
- You motherfucker! Get me out!
- I really thought

1095
01:19:13,904 --> 01:19:16,573
your hamster could swim,
and I'm so sorry that Regal died.

1096
01:19:16,656 --> 01:19:18,867
But this is all gonna
make sense to you later on.

1097
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:20,636
I got to run. I'm so sorry.
I love you! Mwah!

1098
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:21,661
Guys, we gotta go!

1099
01:19:21,745 --> 01:19:23,097
- We can't let him get away!
- Let's go, let's go!

1100
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:24,321
Your plan's the fucking worst.

1101
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:29,211
- Are you okay?
- Your sister's a shitty driver.

1102
01:19:29,294 --> 01:19:30,712
That's not Char, that's the Butcher

1103
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:32,339
- and he's got the Dola.
- What?

1104
01:19:32,422 --> 01:19:33,423
Come on, guys. Let's go!

1105
01:19:49,981 --> 01:19:52,359
Yo-ho-ho, Millie Vanilli.

1106
01:19:52,442 --> 01:19:54,111
Where's my boy Booker?

1107
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:55,779
Thought you guys were together.

1108
01:19:56,363 --> 01:19:57,531
Okay.

1109
01:20:04,037 --> 01:20:06,790
So, you think
you're this hot shit now, huh?

1110
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:10,919
You know, I've never made
anyone's pussy dry.

1111
01:20:11,002 --> 01:20:12,003
I mean, look at me.

1112
01:20:15,173 --> 01:20:16,425
Oh, now you like it.

1113
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:19,678
All right, come on.

1114
01:20:27,144 --> 01:20:28,145
Wait, wait.

1115
01:20:30,397 --> 01:20:31,773
Looks clear.

1116
01:20:31,857 --> 01:20:32,858
Let's go.

1117
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:34,609
You guys stay here.

1118
01:20:35,569 --> 01:20:36,903
This is way too dangerous.

1119
01:20:36,987 --> 01:20:39,322
There is no way
we're not helping you, Mill.

1120
01:20:39,406 --> 01:20:40,407
We're in this together.

1121
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,243
Thirteen minutes left.

1122
01:20:44,661 --> 01:20:45,912
Or you're the Butcher forever.

1123
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,480
Hey, come here, give me your wrist.

1124
01:20:49,124 --> 01:20:50,125
Let me set a timer.

1125
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:52,127
Oh, okay.

1126
01:20:58,175 --> 01:20:59,968
Time to stab this asshole.

1127
01:21:12,647 --> 01:21:14,941
Well, what do you know?
Looks like we got

1128
01:21:15,025 --> 01:21:16,735
a little private party going here, huh?

1129
01:21:18,236 --> 01:21:20,322
Uh, are you good at math, Millie?

1130
01:21:21,698 --> 01:21:23,367
'Cause the way I see it,

1131
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:27,537
you have three holes, and it all adds up.

1132
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:41,760
Will make it easier.

1133
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:43,053
There we go.

1134
01:21:45,138 --> 01:21:46,181
What the fuck?

1135
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:04,116
What the fuck did you do to
my friends, you fucking bitch?

1136
01:22:10,497 --> 01:22:11,540
What are you doing?

1137
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:15,237
Whoa, whoa, look.
Hey, whoa, whoa.

1138
01:22:16,294 --> 01:22:18,046
What are you doing?
Stop. No, no, no.

1139
01:22:19,756 --> 01:22:20,799
Don't.

1140
01:22:21,842 --> 01:22:23,969
Please. I'm sorry.
Please, please, please, please, no.

1141
01:22:24,052 --> 01:22:25,137
I'm sorry!

1142
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:26,596
Look, I'm sorry!

1143
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,764
I'm sorry! Please!

1144
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:31,560
Shit, it's packed.

1145
01:22:32,686 --> 01:22:34,980
We'll search in pairs.
Text if you see him.

1146
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:36,815
Do not try and be a hero.

1147
01:22:36,898 --> 01:22:39,026
- Be careful, Mill.
- You, too.

1148
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:49,661
Hey, hey, hey. What's up?

1149
01:22:49,745 --> 01:22:51,496
Have you seen Millie?

1150
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,248
Uh, Millie, Millie.

1151
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:54,374
Millie.

1152
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:57,127
Oh, yeah. I, uh... I saw her.

1153
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:59,337
- Really? Where?
- Uh, this way.

1154
01:22:59,421 --> 01:23:01,131
Come on. Come on.

1155
01:23:02,257 --> 01:23:03,258
Come on.

1156
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:08,972
I'm not gonna make it.

1157
01:23:09,056 --> 01:23:11,058
Hey, don't say that.
There's still time.

1158
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,769
Sh...

1159
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:18,523
Oh, my God.

1160
01:23:20,442 --> 01:23:22,652
Hey, hey! He's here!
He killed Brett and the others.

1161
01:23:22,736 --> 01:23:25,030
- What? Where's Millie?
- Uh, she went to find Joshua.

1162
01:23:28,075 --> 01:23:29,076
Oh, shit.

1163
01:23:34,873 --> 01:23:35,874
Where is she?

1164
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:38,418
You said you knew where she was.

1165
01:23:38,502 --> 01:23:40,420
She's somewhere.

1166
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,423
Millie, Millie.

1167
01:23:44,299 --> 01:23:46,802
Millie, Millie, Millie.
Millie, Millie.

1168
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:53,016
Phil, I don't have time for this.
Where...

1169
01:23:58,355 --> 01:23:59,439
Loser faggot.

1170
01:23:59,523 --> 01:24:00,524
Wow!

1171
01:24:01,024 --> 01:24:02,234
So self-aware. Bravo.

1172
01:24:03,068 --> 01:24:04,736
You tell anybody, I'll fucking kill you.

1173
01:24:16,289 --> 01:24:17,332
Josh!

1174
01:24:21,545 --> 01:24:23,088
- Get out of here.
- No!

1175
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:25,215
- What are you doing?
- Go!

1176
01:24:31,513 --> 01:24:33,056
I want my body back.

1177
01:24:34,224 --> 01:24:35,392
Come and get it.

1178
01:24:35,809 --> 01:24:37,686
Hey. Hey. We found him.

1179
01:24:37,769 --> 01:24:39,580
- He's gonna kill Millie.
- Right, go help her.

1180
01:24:39,604 --> 01:24:41,273
- I'll slow them down.
- Stop right there!

1181
01:24:41,356 --> 01:24:42,441
Come on.

1182
01:25:07,507 --> 01:25:08,967
Stop! I'm trying to stab myself!

1183
01:25:09,926 --> 01:25:11,178
- Drop the knife!
- Shoot him!

1184
01:25:16,058 --> 01:25:17,893
Come back with my fucking body!

1185
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:39,581
Catch!

1186
01:25:41,291 --> 01:25:42,376
Hold him down.

1187
01:25:52,469 --> 01:25:53,762
No.

1188
01:25:59,559 --> 01:26:01,019
You're too late.

1189
01:26:14,366 --> 01:26:15,534
Wait.

1190
01:26:16,118 --> 01:26:17,911
- Where's the bell?
- What?

1191
01:26:17,994 --> 01:26:20,872
The bell, uh, it didn't toll.

1192
01:26:24,918 --> 01:26:25,961
Pro tip.

1193
01:26:26,503 --> 01:26:28,463
Always set your watch five minutes ahead.

1194
01:26:28,547 --> 01:26:30,173
Saves my ass, like, every time.

1195
01:26:32,217 --> 01:26:33,385
Hold him down.

1196
01:26:34,636 --> 01:26:37,514
No! No! No! No!

1197
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:03,331
Millie?

1198
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:06,060
Who's your favorite athlete?

1199
01:27:06,084 --> 01:27:08,045
- They're over there!
- Hey!

1200
01:27:09,379 --> 01:27:10,964
No one. I hate sports.

1201
01:27:12,716 --> 01:27:13,717
Freeze!

1202
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:16,344
Shoot that motherfucker!

1203
01:27:45,957 --> 01:27:49,669
Um, what the fuck just happened?

1204
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:52,214
That's real.

1205
01:27:56,802 --> 01:27:58,678
Hey. Sorry to interrupt.

1206
01:28:00,013 --> 01:28:01,973
Time to land that plane, girl.

1207
01:28:04,142 --> 01:28:05,310
Hi.

1208
01:28:07,771 --> 01:28:09,231
How's the shoulder?

1209
01:28:09,856 --> 01:28:12,693
Honestly, the best pain I've ever felt.

1210
01:28:16,196 --> 01:28:19,241
So, what are you gonna tell the cops?

1211
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:23,161
A version of the truth, I guess.

1212
01:28:26,665 --> 01:28:29,225
Let's just hope nobody ever gets
their hands on that thing again.

1213
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:34,923
What?

1214
01:28:37,342 --> 01:28:38,802
So,

1215
01:28:39,761 --> 01:28:42,013
that thing

1216
01:28:43,098 --> 01:28:45,308
we were trying to do earlier.

1217
01:28:45,976 --> 01:28:46,977
Oh.

1218
01:28:47,060 --> 01:28:48,061
Oh!

1219
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:52,190
Oh, are we, are we ready
to try that again?

1220
01:28:52,274 --> 01:28:53,942
I don't know. Let's see. Let's...

1221
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,034
- That's much better.
- Mmm.

1222
01:29:13,128 --> 01:29:14,504
Yeah, Mill!

1223
01:29:17,049 --> 01:29:18,258
Millie!

1224
01:29:19,176 --> 01:29:20,427
- Mom?
- Oh.

1225
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:26,141
Oh, Millie, you're okay.
I was so worried.

1226
01:29:41,073 --> 01:29:42,783
His pulse and heart rate are weak.

1227
01:29:43,533 --> 01:29:45,327
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1228
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:46,828
Good.

1229
01:29:46,912 --> 01:29:48,497
How empathetic.

1230
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:51,500
If you'd seen the carnage,
you'd be glad, too.

1231
01:29:55,212 --> 01:29:56,922
Looks like you got your wish.

1232
01:30:09,351 --> 01:30:10,977
I'm tired.
I'm gonna hit the sack.

1233
01:30:11,061 --> 01:30:12,312
Good night, Char.

1234
01:30:12,896 --> 01:30:13,939
Hey.

1235
01:30:15,107 --> 01:30:16,233
I love you, sis.

1236
01:30:16,858 --> 01:30:19,736
I love you, too, stinker.

1237
01:30:21,988 --> 01:30:24,116
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Charlene.

1238
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:33,709
So,

1239
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:37,754
that application to Boston,

1240
01:30:40,674 --> 01:30:42,134
I want you to go.

1241
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:49,558
It's okay. I don't need to go.

1242
01:30:50,434 --> 01:30:51,727
You're my daughter.

1243
01:30:52,394 --> 01:30:53,687
Nothing will ever change that.

1244
01:30:55,814 --> 01:30:57,566
Live your life, Millie.

1245
01:31:00,777 --> 01:31:01,903
Thanks, Mom.

1246
01:31:45,447 --> 01:31:46,615
Char!

1247
01:31:47,157 --> 01:31:49,034
You left the door open again.

1248
01:31:54,039 --> 01:31:55,040
Char?

1249
01:32:04,049 --> 01:32:05,050
Hello?

1250
01:33:21,043 --> 01:33:22,753
What's the matter, Millie?

1251
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,672
You got what you wanted, right?

1252
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,425
You got your body back.

1253
01:33:29,634 --> 01:33:30,844
Why aren't you happy?

1254
01:33:31,511 --> 01:33:32,763
Freeze!

1255
01:33:37,225 --> 01:33:38,745
Little girls shouldn't play with guns.

1256
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:46,276
Run, Millie! Run!

1257
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:16,181
Well, don't stop.

1258
01:34:17,516 --> 01:34:18,558
Keep coming.

1259
01:34:24,606 --> 01:34:26,191
I've been in your body.

1260
01:34:27,025 --> 01:34:29,194
I understand why you feel so weak.

1261
01:34:29,569 --> 01:34:30,821
Why you feel so meager.

1262
01:34:31,613 --> 01:34:33,824
And all that anxiety that you got.

1263
01:34:35,909 --> 01:34:37,202
Clinging to your dead dad.

1264
01:34:38,161 --> 01:34:40,414
You're really just
a lesser version of her.

1265
01:34:41,081 --> 01:34:43,792
And having to take all those orders
from some drunk mom.

1266
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:45,752
Ah! God! Ah!

1267
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:50,173
That's not a life.

1268
01:34:51,007 --> 01:34:52,008
But it's all right.

1269
01:34:53,844 --> 01:34:55,137
It's okay.

1270
01:34:55,929 --> 01:34:57,055
We'll fix it.

1271
01:35:05,063 --> 01:35:06,481
You know...

1272
01:35:11,319 --> 01:35:13,447
I learned something
when I was in your body, too.

1273
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:14,656
What's that?

1274
01:35:17,325 --> 01:35:18,660
Having balls sucks.

1275
01:35:20,746 --> 01:35:21,872
Take my hand!

1276
01:35:23,915 --> 01:35:24,958
Millie!

1277
01:35:49,232 --> 01:35:50,233
Damn, Mill.

1278
01:35:57,866 --> 01:35:59,993
I am a fucking piece.
