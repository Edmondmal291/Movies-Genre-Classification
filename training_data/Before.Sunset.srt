Do you consider the book
to be autobiographical?

23
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,417
Mmm. Um, well...

24
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:07,462
I mean, isn't everything autobiographical?

25
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:13,426
I mean, we all see the world through
our own tiny keyhole. Right?

26
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,512
I always think of Thomas Wolfe.

27
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:18,890
Have you ever seen that little
one-page note to reader

28
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,517
in the front of <i>Look Homeward, Angel?</i>

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,519
You know what I'm talking about?

30
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:26,940
Anyway, he says that we are the sum
of all the moments of our lives

31
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:30,819
and that anybody who sits down to write
is gonna use the clay of their own life,

32
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,737
that you can't avoid that.

33
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:35,406
So when I look at my own life, you know,

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,784
I have to admit, right, that I've —

35
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:42,413
I've never been around a bunch
of guns or violence, you know, not really.

36
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:46,668
No political intrigue
or a helicopter crash, right?

37
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:51,381
But my life, from my own point of view,
has been full of drama. Right?

38
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:57,262
And so I thought if I could write a book
that — that could capture what it's like

39
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,138
to... to really meet somebody.

40
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:02,433
<i>And one of the most exciting things
that's ever happened to me</i>

41
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,437
<i>is to really meet somebody,
make that connection.</i>

42
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,690
And if I could make that valuable,
you know, to capture that,

43
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,901
<i>that — that would be the attempt, or...</i>

44
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,946
<i>Did I answer your question? I...</i>

45
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,992
I'll try to be more specific. Okay?

46
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:23,580
Was there ever a French young woman
on a train you met and spent an evening with?

47
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:27,458
Um...

I mean, that's not important. You know?</i>

WOMAN: <i>So that's a yes.</i>

50
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:39,721
All right, since I'm in France and this is
the last stop of my book tour, yes.

Mr. Wallace, the book ends
on an ambiguous note.

53
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,395

<i>I think I answered that.

57

It's a good test,
if you're a romantic or a cynic. Right?

58
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,917
I mean, you think — you think
they get back together, right?

- You don't, for sure.
- No.

60
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:14,297
And you hope they do, but you're not sure.
That's why you're asking the question.

- We have time for one last question.

66
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,984
What is your next book?

67
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,363
Uh... I don't know, man.

68
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,114
I don't know.

69
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:43,660
I've been...
I've been thinking about this —

70
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,537
Well, I always
kinda wanted to write a book

71
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,375
that all took place, uh,
within the space of a pop song.

72
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,169
You know, like three or four
minutes long, the whole thing.

73
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:57,173
The story — The idea
is that there's this guy, right,

74
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,385
and he's totally depressed.

75
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:04,514
I mean, his great dream was to be
a lover, an adventurer, you know,

76
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:07,684
riding motorcycles through South America.

77
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,645
And instead he's sitting
at a marble table eating lobster.

78
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:15,233
He's got a good job and a beautiful wife,
right, everything that he needs.

79
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:20,655
But that doesn't matter, because
what he wants is to fight for meaning.

80
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,199
You know? I mean,
happiness is in the doing, right?

81
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,702
Not in the getting what you want.

82
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:27,704
So he's sitting there,

83
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:29,539
and just that second

84
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:33,835
his little five-year-old daughter
hops up on the table.

85
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:37,380
And he knows that she should get down,
'cause she could get hurt.

86
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:42,218
But she's dancing to this pop song
in a summer dress.

87
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:47,557
<i>And he looks down,
and all of a sudden, uh, he's 16.</i>

88
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:53,688
And his high school sweetheart
is dropping him off at home.

89
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:57,608
And they just lost their virginity,
and she loves him,

90
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:01,779
and the same song
is playing on the car radio.

91
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,866
She climbs up and starts
dancing on the roof of the car.

92
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,784
And now he's worried about her.

93
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:11,164
And she's beautiful, with a facial expression
just like his daughter's.

94
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:13,666
<i>In fact, maybe that's why
he even likes her.</i>

95
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,420
<i>See, he knows he's not remembering
this dance. He's there.</i>

96
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,964
<i>He's there in both moments simultaneously.</i>

97
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:24,135
And just like for an instant,
all his life is just folding in on itself.

98
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:27,263
And it's obvious to him
that time is a lie,

99
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:28,723
uh...

100
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,101
uh, that it's — that it's —
it's all happening all the time,

101
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:37,607
and inside every moment is another moment,
all... you know, happening simultaneously.

00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,346
and that you were going to be here.

153
00:09:13,429 --> 00:09:15,699
- It's funny because I read an article on your book.
- Uh-huh.

154
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,559
- And it sounded vaguely familiar.
- Vaguely, yeah.

155
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:20,645
Yes. (LAUGHS)

156
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,649
But I didn't put it all together
until I saw your photo, so...

157
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,734
Did you have a chance to read it?

158
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:31,030
Yes! I, um... I was really, really surprised,
as you can imagine.

159
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,033
I mean, I had to read it twice, actually.

160
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,077
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

161
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,412
<i>- Comme ci, comme ça?</i>
- No, I liked it!

162
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,039
- Yeah?
- It's very romantic.

163
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,084
I usually don't like that,
but it's really well-written.

164
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,086
It's really well-written. No, I really —

165
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,712
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

166
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,506
- Wait.
- What?

167
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,843
Before we go anywhere, I have, um...
I have to ask you.

168
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,095
Sure. What?

169
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:57,265
Did you show up in Vienna that December?

170
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,058
Ah.

171
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,643
Uh, did you?

172
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:04,230
No, I couldn't. But did you?

173
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:07,775
- I need to know. It's important to me.
- Why, if you didn't?

174
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,568
Well, did you?

175
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,821
No.

176
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,699
Oh! Oh, thank God you didn't.

177
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,536
- I'm, like — Oh, my God.
- Thank God I didn't <i>and</i> you didn't.

178
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,539
If one of us had showed up there alone,
then that would have sucked.

179
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:23,249
I know. I was so concerned with that.

180
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,002
I always felt horrible about
not being there, but I couldn't.

181
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,505
My grandma died a few days before
and she was buried that day, December 16.

182
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,632
- She died? The one in Budapest?
- Yes.

183
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:33,759
- You remember that?
- I remember everything.

184
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,594
Of course. It was in your book.

185
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:41,058
But anyway, I was about to fly to Vienna
and we heard the news about her,

186
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,769
and of course I had to go to the funeral
with my parents.

187
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,938
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I know.

188
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,108
But you weren't there anyway.

189
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,819
Wait. Why weren't you there?

190
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:55,281
I would have been there if I could have.
I made plans.

191
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,658
You better have a good reason.

192
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,660
What?

193
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,872
Oh. No.

194
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,583
No, you <i>were</i> there, weren't you?

195
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,461
Oh, no! (LAUGHING) Oh, that's terrible!

196
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:10,463
I'm laughing, but I don't mean it.

197
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:13,716
Did you hate me? You must have hated me.
Have you been hating me all this time?

198
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,967
- You have.
- No! No!

199
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,093
- Yes, you have.
- No.

200
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,095
But you can't hate me now, right?

201
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,557
- I mean, my grandma —
- I don't hate you. It's no big deal.

202
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,393
I flew all the way over there.
You blew the thing off.

203
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:27,521
My life's been a big nosedive since then,
but it's not a problem.

204
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:28,874
- No, you can't say that.
- I'm kidding.

205
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,608
I can't believe it!

206
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,486
You must have been so angry with me.
I'm so sorry.

207
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,256
I really wanted to be there
more than anything in the world. I swear.

208
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,759
- Honestly — I swear —
- You can't be angry now. My grandmother.

209
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:42,912
No, I know. I honestly thought that
something like that might have happened.

210
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,039
- I was definitely bummed.
- (SIGHS)

211
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:49,001
But mostly I was mad we hadn't exchanged
any phone numbers or any information.

212
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:53,172
That was so stupid. No way to get in touch.
I didn't even know your last name, nothing.

213
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,634
But remember, we were both afraid
that if we started writing and calling

214
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,178
that it would slowly, you know, fade out.

215
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,139
- Yeah, it definitely wasn't a slow fade.
- No, it sure wasn't.

216
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:05,619
- We wanted to pick up where we left off.
- Which would have been fine if it had worked.

217
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,561
- A good idea. Yeah.
- Oh, well.

218
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,688
(SIGHS) So...

219
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,107
So...

220
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,193
- How long were you in Vienna then?
- Just a couple days.

221
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:18,614
- Did you meet another girl?
- Uh, yeah.

222
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,200
- Her name was Gretchen. She was amazing.
- You did?

223
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,261
Yeah. The book's really
a composite of the two of you.

224
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,371
- Really? Oh, no!
- No, I'm kidding.

225
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,374
You wouldn't belie —
I even went back to the train station.

226
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:32,169
I put up signs of my number and the hotel
in case you'd been delayed.

227
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:35,005
- I was a total dork.
- Let's go this way. Did you get any calls?

228
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:38,300
Just a couple hookers
looking for a gig, you know.

229
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,095
No, it was awful.
What do you want me to say?

230
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,097
Oh, it's so sad. I'm so sorry.

231
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,100
I walked around for a couple days.
Eventually I flew home.

232
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:50,771
I owed my dad 2,000 bucks, who had warned me
about French chicks, I have to say.

233
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,773
What did he tell you about French women?

234
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,109
Nothing. The guy —
He's never met any French women.

235
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,570
He's never been east of the Mississippi.

236
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:01,866
So why didn't you put "six months later
the French bitch didn't show up"?

237
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,701
No, but I did. I did.

238
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:06,704
- You did?
- Yeah. No, I made it more hopeful.

239
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,915
I wrote this whole fictional version
where you actually <i>do</i> show up.

240
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,626
- Oh. What happens?
- Well, um...

241
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:15,337
- What?
- (STAMMERING)

242
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:18,716
- We make love for about ten days straight.
- Oh. That's interesting.

243
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,510
- So the French slut, right? Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, exactly.

244
00:13:21,594 --> 00:13:26,056
Then they get to know each other better
and realize they don't get along at all.

245
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,058
I like that. It's more real.

246
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:30,060
Yeah, well, my editor didn't think that way.

247
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,313
No. Everyone wants to believe in love.
It sells, right?

248
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,982
Yeah, exactly. So...

249
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:39,361
So things are going well for you. Right?
Your book is a best seller in the US.

250
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,655
- It's a tiny best seller.
- Oh, come on.

251
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,073
All right, officially, yes.

252
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:46,410
But most people haven't read <i>Moby-Dick.</i>
Why should they read my book?

253
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:49,038
I haven't read <i>Moby-Dick,</i>
and I liked your book, so...

254
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,247
Thanks.

255
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:53,459
Even though I thought
you idealized the night of it.

256
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,961
Oh! Come on. It's officially fiction, right?

257
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:58,589
- No, I know, I know, I know.
- I mean, I'm supposed to —

258
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,675
I thought there were times
where you made me — (GASPS)

259
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,012
Well, I mean <i>her,</i> right? No, me.

260
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,722
Okay, whatever.

261
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,140
A little bit neurotic.

262
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,952
- But you are a little bit like that, aren't you?
- You think I'm neurotic?

263
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:13,145
No, no, no! Come on! I'm kidding.

264
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:16,315
- Where did I do that? I didn't do that.
- Oh, maybe it's just me.

265
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,900
You know, um...

266
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,903
reading something, knowing the character
in the story is based on you,

267
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,781
it's both flattering
and disturbing at the same time.

268
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,908
How is it disturbing?

269
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,535
I don't know.

270
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,329
Just being part of someone else's memory.

271
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,831
Seeing myself through your eyes.

272
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,709
How long did it take you to write it?

273
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:38,420
Uh, three or four years, on and off.

274
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,632
Wow, that's a really long time
to be writing about one night.

275
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,760
Yeah, I know. Tell me about it.

276
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,513
I always assumed you had forgotten me.

277
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,641
No, I had a pretty clear picture
of you in my mind.

278
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,143
- I have to tell you something. I just —
- What?

279
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:56,814
I've wanted to talk to you for so long
that now it's just surreal.

280
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,918
- Like everything out of my mouth should be —
- I know. How long do we have?

281
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,945
- Twenty minutes and 30 seconds?
- No, we got more than that.

282
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,407
I want to know about you. Tell me.
What are you doing? What are you up to?

283
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,952
Uh, where to start?
I, um... I work for Green Cross.

284
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:13,163
- It's an environmental organization.
- Yeah? What are they all about?

285
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,083
Well, we basically work on
different environment issues,

286
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,752
from clean water to
disarmament of chemical weapons.

287
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,297
You know, international laws
that deal with the environment.

288
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,008
- And what do you do for them?
- We're going this way.

289
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,884
Uh, different things.

290
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:29,597
Like, last year I was in India for a while,
working on a water treatment plant.

291
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,973
Wow!

292
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,018
The cotton industry there
is a major source of pollution, so...

293
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,187
It sounds like you're
actually doing something.

294
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,941
Most people, myself included,
just sit around and bitch,

295
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:44,403
you know, how America's consuming
all the world's resources,

296
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,864
SUVs suck, global warming is real.

297
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,659
I'm relieved to hear you're not one of
those "Freedom fries" kind of Americans.

298
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:53,245
Hey, you know...
But how'd you get into that?

299
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:56,707
Uh, I came out of political science and
I was hoping to work for the government.

300
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,001
And I did for a little while.
Ugh. Terrible.

301
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,669
- Not good.
- No.

302
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:03,380
Anyway, I got really tired —
Let's go this way —

303
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,716
of having this endless
conversation with friends

304
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,344
about how the world was falling to pieces.

305
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:12,431
So I decided what I really wanted to do
was to find things that could be fixed

306
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,600
and try to fix them, you know.

307
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,354
Yeah, I always thought you'd be
doing something cool like that. I did.

308
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,647
Thanks.

309
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,567
I just feel really, really lucky
to be doing a job I like, you know.

310
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,402
Yeah.

311
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:30,199
I actually alternate in between thinking
that everything is irrevocably screwed up

312
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:32,743
and that things might be
getting better in some ways.

313
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:35,496
Better? How could you possibly say that?

314
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,331
Well, I just mean, you know, like...

315
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:41,126
I know it sounds weird,
but there are things to be optimistic about.

316
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,419
Okay.

317
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,421
Um, I know your book is selling.

318
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,423
Which is great. I'm very happy for you.

319
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:49,677
But let me break the news to you.
The world is a mess right now!

320
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,572
- From a Western point of view, things are better.
- I wasn't saying that —

321
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,723
We're moving all our industry
to developing nations

322
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:57,726
where we can get cheap labor
free of any environmental laws.

323
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,353
The weapon industry is booming.

324
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,398
Five million people die every year
from preventable water disease.

325
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,400
So how is the world getting any better?

326
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,986
I'm not getting angry. But come on.
I want to know. I'm interested.

327
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,657
I realize that there are a lot
of serious problems in the world.

328
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,200
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay?

329
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,578
I mean, I don't even have one publisher
in the whole Asian market.

330
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,414
- (SNICKERS, LAUGHS)
- All right.

331
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,541
- Just say stop.
- What? Stop.

332
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,000
- Uh-oh!
- No, look!

333
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,254
All I'm saying is there's more awareness.
People are gonna fight back.

334
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,547
- Okay.
- You know?

335
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,150
I think the world might be getting better
because people like you

336
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,718
are educated and speaking out.

337
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:34,138
Even the very notion of conservation,
environmental issues,

338
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,849
those weren't even
in the vocabulary until fairly recently.

339
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,475
They're becoming the norm

340
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,353
and eventually might be
what's expected all over the world.

341
00:17:41,437 --> 00:17:44,648
I agree with what you're saying,
but at the same time it's dangerous.

342
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:49,403
An imperialist country can use that kind
of thinking to justify their economic greed.

343
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,238
You know, I — Human rights —

344
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,908
Is there any particular imperialist country
you have in mind there, Frenchie?

345
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,161
- Mmm. No, not really.
- No?

346
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,997
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

347
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,834
(SIGHS) So, you want to sit over there?

348
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,919
Yeah, this is perfect.

349
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:08,172
Oh, wow.

350
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,384
Maybe what I'm saying is the world
might be evolving the way a person evolves.

351
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:14,386
Right? Like, I mean me, for example.

352
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,931
Am I getting worse?
Am I improving? I don't know.

353
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:23,020
When I was younger, I was healthier,
but I was wracked with insecurity. You know?

354
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,775
Now I'm older, my problems are deeper,
but I'm more equipped to handle them.

355
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,527
So what are your problems?

356
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,281
Right now I don't have any.

357
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,699
I don't. You know?

358
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:38,660
I'm just damn happy to be here.

359
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:40,788
Me too.

360
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,918
So, how long have you been in Paris?

361
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,505
I got in last night.
I've done ten cities in 12 days.

362
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,759
I'm wrecked. I'm so glad it's over.
I'm tired of being a huckster.

363
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,010
Well, hello.

364
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,929
- (SPEAKING FRENCH)
- Uh, what do you want?

365
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,847
Um, a cup of coffee.

366
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,558
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

367
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:07,314
God, I love this café.
I wish they had places like this in the US.

368
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,150
Yeah, I missed cafés
when I was living over there.

369
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:13,111
I find a few places I really liked,
but there was —

370
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,823
- You were living in the US?
- Yes.

371
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:19,243
From '96 to '99. I was studying at NYU.

372
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,246
Oh, God! Don't tell me that, Celine!

373
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,498
- What?
- No, it's just...

374
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,333
- Nothing. I mean, I...
- What?

375
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:29,628
I've been living in New York since '98.
We were there at the same time.

376
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,129
- In New York?
- Yeah.

377
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,173
Wow, that's weird.

378
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:36,176
It actually crossed my mind a few times
that I might run into you.

379
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,096
But the odds are so slim, right? So...

380
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,723
I didn't even know
what city you were living in.

381
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,726
- Weren't you somewhere in Texas?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely.

382
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,981
I was for a long time.
I just, you know, wanted to try New York.

383
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,816
Mmm. Wow.

384
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,818
What brought you back here?

385
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:56,822
I had finished my master's, for one.
And no visa. No more visa.

386
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,533
And anyway,
I was starting to get paranoid.

387
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,453
All the violence in the medias,
gang violence, murders.

388
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,330
Especially serial killers.

389
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,625
But the final straw was,

390
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,880
one night I heard some noise
on my fire escape, so I called 911.

391
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:14,464
And the cops came, eventually.

392
00:20:14,548 --> 00:20:18,594
- Yeah, like, three hours later.
- After I'd been raped and killed three times.

393
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,305
No, but it was a man and a woman officer.

394
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,307
I was explaining to them what I had heard

395
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,143
when the woman had to run downstairs
to move the police car.

396
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,022
So I was left alone with the male cop,
and right away he asked me if I had a gun.

397
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,482
And I said no, of course not.

398
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:37,988
And he told me, "You better think about
getting one. This is America, not France.

399
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,323
Okay?"

400
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,451
And I said to him,
"I have no idea how to shoot a gun,

401
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,245
and I have no interest
in firearms whatsoever."

402
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:49,124
And that's when he pulled out his gun
like this, and he went,

403
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:54,880
"Well, one day you're gonna
have something like this in your face.

404
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:57,382
And if you want to have a long life,

405
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:01,803
you're gonna have to choose
between you or them."

406
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:04,139
And then they left.

407
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,309
The next morning
I called for an application to get a gun.

408
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,978
Me, with a gun.
I mean, that's really scary.

409
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,314
But then I realized something was wrong,

410
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,834
the way that cop had pulled his gun out
and everything, right?

411
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,068
Yeah, sure.

412
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,987
So I canceled my demand for the gun
and I called the police station

413
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,323
and tried to complain
about that cop's behavior, but —

414
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,867
- What happened with that?
- It was so much paperwork.

415
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,870
Then I got scared
with my shitty student visa.

416
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:28,181
You thought you'd get deported?

417
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,166
Yeah, exactly. So I gave up
and I forgot about the whole thing.

418
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,795
- Well, I guess I never forgot.
- Well, obviously. Yeah.

419
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,256
But still, you know,
I really enjoyed being there.

420
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,468
- There's a lot of things I miss about the US.
- Yeah? Like what?

421
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:44,179
Um... well...

422
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,641
the overall good mood people have there.

423
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,018
Even if it can be bullshit sometimes.

424
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:54,189
Like, "How you doing?" "Great. How you doing?"
"Great!" "Have a great day!"

425
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,525
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
- I don't know.

426
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,695
Parisians can be so grumpy.
Have you noticed?

427
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,531
Uh, no.
Everybody seems pretty happy to me.

428
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,325
- (GROANS) They're not happy.
- They're not happy?

429
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,705
No, they are. I just mean French men.
They drive me nuts.

430
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,289
What is it? What about them?

431
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,501
Well, they're very nice.
They're great, you know, to be around.

432
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,503
They love food, wine. They're great cooks.

433
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,755
But maybe I've had really bad luck with them.

434
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,342
- Why? What do you mean?
- Um, well...

435
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,428
- I guess they're not as, um...
- What?

436
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:28,181
What's the word? Um... horny?

437
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,019
- They're not as horny.
- All right, listen to me on this one.

438
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:35,230
In that regard,
I am proud to be an American.

439
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,190
And you should be. In that regard only.

440
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,150
<i>Merci.</i>

441
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,527
Have you ever spent time
in Eastern Europe?

442
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,195
- Eastern? No. I don't —
- No?

443
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,780
Thank you.

444
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:46,992
I, uh — I remember as a teenager
I went to Warsaw

445
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,077
when it was still
a strict Communist regime.

446
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,414
- Which I don't approve of at all.
- Oh, yeah. Sure, you don't.

447
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:54,583
- No, I don't!
- No, I'm just kidding.

448
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,627
But anyway, something about being there
was very interesting, I found.

449
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:01,131
After a couple of weeks,
something changed in me.

450
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,301
The city was quite gloomy and gray,

451
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,512
but after a while my brain seemed clearer.

452
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,891
I was writing a lot more in my journal,
ideas I'd never thought of before.

453
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,601
Communist ideas?

454
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:14,978
- Listen, I am not a Communist —
- I'm sorry.

455
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,938
- Okay.
- Go on.

456
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:19,566
Okay. (LAUGHS) I'll send you to a gulag.

457
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:23,445
No, but it took me a while to figure out
why I felt, you know, so different.

458
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:26,448
Then one day, as I was walking
through the Jewish cemetery —

459
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,658
I don't know why,
but it occurred to me there —

460
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:32,204
I realized that I had spent the last two weeks
away from most of my habits.

461
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:34,498
TV was in a language I didn't understand.

462
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,375
There was nothing to buy,
no advertisements anywhere,

463
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:41,963
so all I'd been doing was
walk around, think and write.

464
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,717
My brain felt like it was at rest,
free from the consuming frenzy,

465
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,928
and it was almost like a natural high.

466
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:54,142
I felt so peaceful inside, no strange urge
to be somewhere else, to shop.

467
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,269
Maybe it could have seemed
like boredom at first,

468
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,522
but it quickly became very, very soulful.

469
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,233
It was interesting, you know?

470
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:04,903
Can you believe it was nine years ago
that we were walking around Vienna?

471
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:08,782
- Nine years? No, that's impossible.
- No, it was. It feels like two months ago to me.

472
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:10,158
But it was summer, '94.

473
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,911
Mm-hmm.

474
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,704
Do I look any different?

475
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,958
I do?

476
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,711
- I'd have to see you naked.
- What?

477
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:25,257
I know. I'm sorry. (LAUGHS)
No, your hair was different back then.

478
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,551
- What?
- Yeah, take it down. Let's see.

479
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,137
Down. It was down. Okay.

480
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,514
Well? <i>Voilà.</i>

481
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,349
So?

482
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:38,520
Okay, come on. Tell me.

483
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,481
Uh...

484
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,899
skinnier, I think.

485
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,401
A little thinner.

486
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,987
Did you think I was fat before?

487
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,321
No!

488
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:51,867
Yeah, you thought I was a fatty.
You thought I was a fatty!

489
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,870
Yeah, you wrote a book
about a fat French girl.

490
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,454
- No, listen...
- Oh, no.

491
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,582
Seriously, all right? You look beautiful.

492
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,250
Do I look any different?

493
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:02,836
No, not at all.

494
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,880
Well, actually, you have this line.

495
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,507
- I know.
- It's like a scar.

496
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:10,760
- A scar? What, like a gunshot wound?
- No, no, no.

497
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:12,137
I like it. I'm sorry.

498
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,390
I had this, uh, funny —

499
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:18,185
well, horrible dream the other day.

500
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:23,315
Um, I was having this awful nightmare
that I was 32.

501
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,109
And then I woke up and I was 23 —
so relieved.

502
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:29,529
- Mm-hmm.
- And then I woke up for real and I was 32.

503
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:30,864
- Oh, shit.
- Scary.

504
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:33,992
- It happens.
- Yeah, time goes faster and faster.

505
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:38,663
Apparently we don't renew our synapses after 20,
so it's downhill from then on. Oh, well.

506
00:25:38,747 --> 00:25:41,041
(LAUGHING) I like getting older.

507
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:44,211
Life feels... I don't know.
It feels more immediate.

508
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,713
- Mm-hmm.
- Like I can appreciate things more.

509
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:50,175
Me too, actually. I really love it.

510
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:54,012
I was once a... a drummer in a band.

511
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,806
- You were?
- Yeah. We were pretty good, actually.

512
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,353
But the lead singer guy, he was just so
obsessed with us getting a record deal.

513
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,356
It's all we talked about. It's all we
thought about. Getting bigger shows.

514
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,942
Everything was just focused
on the future all the time.

515
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:09,778
And now the band doesn't
even exist anymore, right?

516
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:15,742
Looking back at the shows we did play,
even rehearsing, it was so much fun.

517
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,119
Now I'd be able to enjoy
every minute of it.

518
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,247
- Could I have a drag of that?
- Mm-hmm.

519
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,250
Well, your book has been published.
That's a pretty big deal.

520
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,878
And you've been all around Europe with it.
Are you enjoying every minute of it?

521
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:29,464
- Not really.
- Not really?

522
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,258
No.

523
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:34,678
- You have another one of those?
- Yes, of course.

524
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,097
Um... Here.

525
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:41,726
In my field I see these people that —
Oh, sorry.

526
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,187
come into it with big idealist visions

527
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,607
of becoming the new leader
that will create a better world.

528
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:50,360
- They enjoy the goal, but not the process.
- Right.

529
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,363
But the reality of it is that
the true work of improving things

530
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,532
is in the little achievements of the day.

531
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,815
And that's what you need to enjoy
to stay in that field.

532
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,202
What do you mean, exactly?

533
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:02,580
For example, I was working for this organization
that helped villages in Mexico.

534
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:08,295
Their concern was how to get the pencils
sent to the kid in those little country schools.

535
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:12,340
It was not about big, revolutionary ideas.
It was about pencils.

536
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:16,177
I see the people that do the real work,
and what's really sad in a way is that

537
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:21,308
the people that are the most giving, hard-working
and capable of making this world better

538
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:24,853
usually don't have the ego
and ambition to be a leader.

539
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,314
They don't see any interest
in superficial rewards.

540
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:30,900
They don't care if their name
ever appears in the press.

541
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:33,278
They actually enjoy
the process of helping others.

542
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,030
They're in the moment.

543
00:27:35,113 --> 00:27:37,866
Yeah, but that's so hard,
you know, to be in the moment.

544
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:43,330
I just feel like I'm designed
to be slightly dissatisfied with everything.

545
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,541
I mean, like always trying to
better my situation, you know.

546
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:50,378
I satisfy one desire,
and it just agitates another.

547
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:54,215
But then I think to hell with it, right?
Desire's the fuel of life.

548
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,093
Do you think it's true that if, uh...

549
00:27:57,177 --> 00:28:00,263
if we never wanted anything
we'd never be unhappy?

550
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:01,639
I don't know.

551
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:05,310
Not wanting anything,
isn't that a symptom of depression?

552
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:06,936
- Yeah, that is, right?
- Yeah.

553
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,314
I mean, it's healthy to desire, right?

554
00:28:09,397 --> 00:28:10,899
Yeah. I don't know.

555
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,276
It's what all those
Buddhist guys say, right?

556
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,322
Liberate yourself from desire and you'll find
you already have everything you need.

557
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:21,993
Yeah, but I feel really alive when I want
something more than basic survival needs.

558
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,455
Wanting, whether it's intimacy with
another person or a new pair of shoes,

559
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,207
is kind of beautiful.

560
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:30,210
I like that we have those
ever-renewing desires. You know?

561
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,712
Maybe it's just a sense of entitlement.

562
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:36,716
Like whenever you feel like you deserve
that new pair of shoes, you know?

563
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,678
It's okay to want things as long as you
don't get pissed off if you don't get them.

564
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,806
Life's hard. It's supposed to be.

565
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:46,059
If we didn't suffer,
we wouldn't learn a thing.

566
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,354
So what, are you Buddhist or something?

567
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,315
- No.
- No? Why not?

568
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,776
I don't know.

569
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,238
Same reason I don't really
consider myself anything, really.

570
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,656
Yeah, I know.

571
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:02,409
I decided a long time ago
I was gonna be open to everything

572
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:05,829
but not buy into
any one and only belief system.

573
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:09,499
I went to this Trappist monastery
a couple years ago.

574
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,042
Trappist?

575
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,962
- Yeah, they're Catholic. Cistercian.
- Oh, okay.

576
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,839
- Why did you do that?
- Why?

577
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,592
I'd just been doing some reading, I guess.
I thought it'd be cool.

578
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,886
Have you ever spent any time
with any monks or nuns?

579
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,055
No. It's not really my style.

580
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:27,100
- No?
- No! (LAUGHING) But go ahead.

581
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:30,103
I expected them to be all glowering
and stern, but they weren't.

582
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,106
They were really quick to laugh,
really easy to be around.

583
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:36,443
Seriously, very attuned to everything.
They were just, uh...

584
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:39,070
You know, they weren't trying
to hustle anybody.

585
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,781
They're trying to live and die
in peace with God

586
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,325
or whatever part of them
they feel is eternal.

587
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,703
And it was just so refreshing
to be around.

588
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:50,999
You realize that most of the people you meet
are trying to get somewhere better.

589
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:54,682
They're trying to make a little bit more cash,
they're trying to get a little more respect,

590
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,297
have more people admire them —
it's exhausting.

591
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,590
No kidding.

592
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:01,259
It's exhausting to be
one of those people yourself.

593
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:04,262
There I am, right, all greedy
to be more spiritual, you know?

594
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:06,264
I want to be a better person, you know?

595
00:30:06,347 --> 00:30:07,891
You can't escape.

596
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:12,145
I had this boyfriend of mine
many years ago

597
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,522
that wanted to be a Buddhist.

598
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,233
So he went to Asia to visit
some of those monasteries.

599
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:20,028
- I thought about doing that too.
- Yeah, and you should.

600
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,280
I'll tell you why —
he was quite good-looking,

601
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,574
and each time he went
to one of those monasteries

602
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,535
a monk offered to suck his cock.

603
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,704
True story!

604
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,665
Well, it all comes down to that, doesn't it?

605
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:35,877
I think that's why I really admire
what you're doing. You know?

606
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,545
What do you mean, sucking cock?

607
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,422
Uh, no!

608
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,549
- Wrong answer.
- No. No.

609
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:44,886
I was gonna say, you're not
detached from life, you know?

610
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,514
You're putting your passion into action.

611
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,058
Well, I try.

612
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:52,143
- Hey, you know something?
- What?

613
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:56,689
I'm gonna be on planes and, like,
in an airport for the next eight hours.

614
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:59,484
I'd just love to see
a little bit more of Paris.

615
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,462
- Would you walk around with me?
- Yeah, let's do that.

616
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,864
- Do you mind? You want to?
- Yeah, yeah, that's great.

617
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,699
What do we owe here? 4.50?

618
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,702
No, no, I got it.
I got a little per diem going on here.

619
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:13,057
- This good for a tip and everything?
- Yeah, that's fine. That's more than enough.

620
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,999
I'll throw that in there too.

621
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,253
- Is there anywhere to go around here?
- It's sales day today.

622
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:21,506
- What's that?
- It's when everything is on sale in Paris.

623
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:24,425
It's twice a year. <i>Au revoir. Merci.</i>

624
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:25,760
<i>Au revoir. Merci.</i>

625
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,595
All right. Let's go shopping.

626
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,515
No, that's a bad idea.
I don't want to inflict that on you.

627
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:31,891
- No?
- It's madness.

628
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:35,019
Let's just go on this garden path.
It's really nice.

629
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:37,564
All right. That sounds better
than shopping, actually.

630
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:39,941
Not that I wouldn't do
whatever you wanted, but...

631
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,026
Sometimes I don't even
need to buy anything.

632
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,946
I just get high on trying on
and looking at things.

633
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,615
Well, a therapist would tell you —
Is this where we're going?

634
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,951
- A therapist would tell you that's all good.
- Really?

635
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:51,354
- Yeah.
- Are you ever in therapy?

636
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,830
No. Do I seem like I'm in therapy?

637
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,373
CELINE: I'm kidding.

638
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,417
Has it helped your sex problems?

639
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,086
- My sex problems?
- (LAUGHS) I'm kidding.

640
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,839
Come on. Tell me the truth.
We didn't have any problems that night.

641
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,300
No! I'm kidding.
We didn't even have sex anyway.

642
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,760
- That's a joke, right?
- No, we didn't.

643
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,554
- (STAMMERS)
- That was the whole thing.

644
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,347
- No, of course we did.
- No, we didn't.

645
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,409
You didn't have a condom
and I never have sex without one.

646
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:15,911
Especially on a one-night thing.
I'm extremely paranoid about my health.

647
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:19,188
Whoa, hold on. I'm finding this very scary
that you don't remember what happened.

648
00:32:19,272 --> 00:32:23,526
No, listen. Okay? I didn't write an entire book,
but I kept a journal. Okay?

649
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,528
And I wrote the whole night in it.

650
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,989
That's what I meant,
you idealizing the night.

651
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:31,159
Listen, I even remember
what brand of condom we used.

652
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,162
Okay, that's disgusting.
I don't want to hear it.

653
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:35,246
- That's not disgusting.
- No.

654
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:40,543
When I get home I'll check my journal
from '94, but I know I'm right.

655
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,590
- Wait a minute.
- What?

656
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:47,508
Was it in the cemetery?

657
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:51,054
No. No, we went to the cemetery
in the afternoon.

658
00:32:51,137 --> 00:32:54,557
It was in the park. Very late at night.

659
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:56,726
- In the park.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

660
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,478
I can't — I can't...

661
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:03,107
Is it that forgettable?
You really don't remember? In the park.

662
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,735
Okay, wait a minute.
I — I think you might be right.

663
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,945
- You're messing with me now.
- No.

664
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,948
- Are you messing with me?
- Okay, no, I'm sorry. I think you're r —

665
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:12,950
I mean you're right, okay?

666
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:16,162
Sometimes I put things in drawers
inside my head and forget about it.

667
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:19,605
I guess it's less painful to put certain things
away than to live with it. I'm sorry.

668
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,126
So that night was like
a sad memory for you?

669
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,920
I didn't mean that night in particular.

670
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,422
I just meant certain things
are better off forgotten.

671
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:29,008
I remember that night
better than I do entire years.

672
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:31,052
- Me too.
- Really?

673
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:33,304
Well, I thought I did.

674
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:40,812
But maybe I put it away because of
the fact that my grandmother's funeral

675
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:43,022
was the day we were
supposed to meet again.

676
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:46,359
Yeah, right. It was a tough day for me,
but it must have been worse for you.

677
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,777
It was unreal.

678
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,822
I remember looking
at her dead body in the coffin,

679
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:54,742
at her beautiful hands, so warm,
so sweet, that used to hold me.

680
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:58,705
But nothing in that coffin resembled
what I remembered of her.

681
00:33:59,455 --> 00:34:01,165
All the warmth was gone.

682
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,459
And then I was crying, so confused,

683
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:06,087
if I was crying because I was never
gonna see her again

684
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,006
or never gonna see you again or...

685
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:13,678
I'm sorry to go on like this.
I've been a little down this week.

686
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,471
- Why?
- I don't know.

687
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:19,392
Nothing bad.
Just, um, reading your book, maybe?

688
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:23,062
No, but thinking of how hopeful
I was that summer and fall,

689
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:26,232
and since then it's been kind of a...

690
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,859
(SIGHS) I don't know.

691
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:32,113
Memory is a wonderful thing
if you don't have to deal with the past.

692
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,699
What?

693
00:34:34,782 --> 00:34:37,618
"Memory is a wonderful thing
if you don't have to deal with the past."

694
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,370
Can I put that on a bumper sticker?

695
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:42,415
If you wrote a book about our night,
that would be a good title.

696
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:46,711
- And it would be a total different book.
- Yeah, there'd be no sex scenes.

697
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,254
- But you know what?
- What?

698
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:52,800
Now that we've met again, we can
change our memory of that December 16.

699
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:56,220
It no longer has that sad ending of us
never seeing each other again.

700
00:34:56,304 --> 00:35:01,058
You're right. I guess a memory's
never finished as long as you're alive.

701
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,769
Yeah, I know.

702
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:06,773
I have this memory from my childhood
that I realized recently never happened.

703
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:08,065
What?

704
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:11,068
Well, when I was eight or nine,
my mom was so paranoid

705
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:14,113
when I was walking home
from my piano lesson at night,

706
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,908
she would always warn me about
dirty old men giving me candies

707
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,910
and then showing me their pee-pees.

708
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:21,913
She was so obsessed with it
that later in life

709
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:25,750
I had this image in my head
that this really happened,

710
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:29,378
to the point that I even associated sex
with that walk home.

711
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:32,757
I mean, and sometimes even now when I'm...

712
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,968
(LAUGHS) when I'm... when I'm having sex,

713
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:38,262
I see myself walking down that street.

714
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:40,264
I swear. It's so weird, right?

715
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,100
Is that street nearby? I mean, could —

716
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:44,477
(LAUGHING) No!

717
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,229
It's very far.

718
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,691
Did you ever keep a journal
when you were a kid?

719
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,528
Yeah. On and off, I guess.

720
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:58,407
It's funny. I read one of mine
from '83 the other day.

721
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:03,496
And what really surprised me is that
I was dealing with life the same way I am now.

722
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,748
I was much more hopeful and naive,

723
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:10,294
but the core and the way I was
feeling things is exactly the same.

724
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:12,713
It made me realize
I haven't changed much at all.

725
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,507
I don't think anybody does.

726
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,261
People don't want to admit it,
but it's like we have these innate set-points,

727
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:22,181
and it's like nothing much that
happens to us changes our disposition.

728
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,891
- Really? You believe that?
- I think so.

729
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,894
I read this study where they followed people
who'd won the lottery

730
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:28,896
and people who'd become paraplegics.

731
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,818
You'd think that one extreme is gonna
make you euphoric and the other suicidal.

732
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,821
But the study shows
that after about six months,

733
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:41,534
as soon as people had gotten used to their
new situation, they were more or less the same.

734
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,369
- The same?
- Well, yeah.

735
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,372
Like, if they were basically
an optimistic, jovial person,

736
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,833
they're now an optimistic,
jovial person in a wheelchair.

737
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:51,043
If they're a petty, miserable asshole,

738
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:54,171
they're a petty, miserable asshole
with a new Cadillac, a house and a boat.

739
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,659
So you mean I'll be forever depressed
no matter what great things happen in my life?

740
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,344
- Definitely.
- Great.

741
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:03,764
- No, come on. Are you depressed now?
- No, I'm not depressed.

742
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,560
But sometimes I worry
that I'll get to the end of my life

743
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,562
feeling I haven't done all I wanted to do.

744
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,814
- Well, what do you want to do?
- (SIGHS)

745
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:16,152
I, um... I want to paint more.
I want to play my guitar every day.

746
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:19,614
I want to learn Chinese.
I want to write more songs.

747
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:22,909
There's so many things I want to do,
and I end up doing not much.

748
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,827
(LAUGHS)

749
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,829
All right. Well, let me ask you this.

750
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:30,041
Do you believe in ghosts or spirits?

751
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,335
Uh, no.

752
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:33,753
- No?
- No.

753
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:36,464
Okay, uh, what about reincarnation?

754
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:37,882
Not at all.

755
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:38,965
- God?
- No.

756
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,259
(BOTH LAUGH)

757
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:42,762
- All right.
- That sounds so terrible. No, no, no.

758
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:46,849
But I don't want to be one of those people
that don't believe in any kind of magic.

759
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,100
So then, astrology?

760
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,435
- Yes! Of course!
- There we go.

761
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,038
- That makes sense, right?
- Obviously.

762
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:53,105
You're a Scorpio, I'm a Sag. We get along.

763
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,107
(LAUGHING)

764
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:57,193
No, no, no.

765
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,404
There's an Einstein quote
I really, really like.

766
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,991
He said if you don't believe
in any kind of magic or mystery,

767
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,243
you're basically as good as dead.

768
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,870
Yeah, I like that.

769
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:11,165
I've always felt there was some kind
of mystical core to the universe.

770
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:15,836
But more recently I've started to think
that — that me, my personality, whatever,

771
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,714
that I don't have
any permanent place here.

772
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,800
You know? In eternity or whatever.

773
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:25,096
And the more I think that, I can't go
through life saying that this is no big deal.

774
00:38:25,179 --> 00:38:27,181
I mean, this is it.
This is actually happening.

775
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,768
What do you think is interesting? Funny?
What do you think is important? You know?

776
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,728
Every day's our last.

777
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:37,358
When I feel that way, I usually call my mom
to tell her how much I love her.

778
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:40,361
- Yeah?
- And she's always, "Are you okay?

779
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:43,489
Do you have cancer?
Are you gonna commit suicide?"

780
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:46,617
It's almost not worth it. (LAUGHING)

781
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:50,287
So... So, what about us?

782
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:51,914
- What about us?
- No. (STAMMERS)

783
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:54,750
What I mean is,
if we were both going to die tonight —

784
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,545
- Like, if the apocalypse was coming?
- No, that's too dramatic.

785
00:38:57,628 --> 00:39:01,048
But what if, you know,
just the two of us were going to die?

786
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:05,219
I mean, would we talk about your book,
the environment, or...

787
00:39:05,302 --> 00:39:07,531
- If today was our last day.
- Yeah, what would we talk about?

788
00:39:07,555 --> 00:39:10,141
- What would you tell me, for example?
- Well, uh...

789
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,309
- That's hard, huh?
- No, I'll do it, I'll do it.

790
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:16,355
I definitely would stop talking about my book.
I admit I would probably drop the environment.

791
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:17,690
Okay.

792
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:21,777
But I would still want to talk
about the magic in the universe.

793
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,031
- I'd just want to do it from a...
- What?

794
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:26,866
A hotel room, you know,

795
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:30,828
in between sessions of us
wildly fucking until we die.

796
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:33,831
Wow. Well, why waste time
with a hotel room?

797
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:37,293
- Why not do it right there on a bench?
- Okay.

798
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,671
- (LAUGHING)
- Come here, come here, come here.

799
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:43,132
Okay. We're not gonna die tonight. Okay?

800
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,342
All right. Too bad. I'm sorry.

801
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:47,845
- That was an extreme example.
- I'm sorry.

802
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,680
Okay.

803
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:54,477
My point was, to truly communicate
with people is very hard to do.

804
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,313
No, I know.
Most of our day-to-day exchanges —

805
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:01,525
Yeah, no, I mean, not to bring
everything back to sex, but —

806
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:03,837
- But why not?
- No, no, this example, this friend of mine.

807
00:40:03,861 --> 00:40:08,407
She was talking about she
and her boyfriend's problems in bed

808
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:12,203
and how when they had been dating
for a year she started telling him

809
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,205
what he could do to please her more.

810
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:16,791
- It totally freaked him out. Totally.
- Why?

811
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,710
He felt threatened.
He thought it meant he was a bad lover.

812
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,379
Maybe she shouldn't have waited so long,
you know, after a year.

813
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:24,965
- But men are so easily offended.
- More than women, you think?

814
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:27,009
- Oh. Definitely, on that subject.
- You think so?

815
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:28,594
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

816
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:30,888
Well, maybe it's because, you know,

817
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:34,558
men are easier to — you know, to please.

818
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,769
- To please? Yeah, no, they are.
- Well, I don't know.

819
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,104
They definitely — Definitely.

820
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:40,147
Anyway, this friend of mine,
she was telling me

821
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,608
that, um, next time she dates another man,

822
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:46,112
she's gonna make a little questionnaire
about what they like and dislike

823
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:48,256
- before they even —
- Like, written down or out loud?

824
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,949
Yeah, yeah. Mostly written down.

825
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:53,869
But it wouldn't be just, you know, yes or no.
It would be a bit more complex than that.

826
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:57,248
Like, for example, if the question is,
"Are you into S and M?"

827
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:02,211
The answer could be, "No, but a good
spanking once in a while doesn't hurt."

828
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,754
- Right?
- All right.

829
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:06,924
Or like, "Do you like talking dirty in bed?"
That kind of thing?

830
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,718
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But not just, like, any dirty talk.

831
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:12,847
Just like, "What specific word
would you like to hear?" You know?

832
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,348
- What, me?
- Well, yeah.

833
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:17,017
Like, for example,
what specific word would you like to hear?

834
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,519
I don't know.

835
00:41:18,602 --> 00:41:22,648
Um, what do you feel
about the word "pussy"?

836
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,567
I love it.

837
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,695
Good. (LAUGHS)

838
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:30,531
It's amazing what perverts we've become
in the past nine years.

839
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:33,951
I know. At least now we don't have to
pretend that each new sexual experience

840
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,953
is like a life-altering event.

841
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:39,540
I know. By now you've stuck it in
so many places, it's about to fall off.

842
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:43,794
And I can't realistically expect you've become
anything but a total ho at this point.

843
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:45,462
Yeah, thank you.

844
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,882
I'm s —

845
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:51,051
- That's true. What can you do?
- What can you do?

846
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:53,929
So, what kind of songs do you write?

847
00:41:54,013 --> 00:41:55,806
- I didn't know you did that.
- What kind?

848
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,975
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't know. Just songs.

849
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,561
Like, some are about, you know, people.

850
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,855
Uh, relationships. One's about my cat.

851
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:05,357
- Sing one.
- No, I can't. I don't have a guitar.

852
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:07,067
- Come on. A cappella.
- No, no, no.

853
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:09,653
I'm not singing a song without a guitar.
You're nuts.

854
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:12,865
Why not?

855
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,409
- No, okay. Not now. No.
- One.

856
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:18,621
If not now, when? You want to meet here
in six months with a guitar?

857
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:21,790
I'll fly all the way over here.
You may or may not make the Metro.

858
00:42:21,874 --> 00:42:23,709
Okay, that's funny.

859
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,920
No. We've got to get going
back to the bookstore.

860
00:42:26,003 --> 00:42:28,315
- We'll be all right.
- You're gonna miss your flight. Let's go.

861
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,216
- All right.
- We can walk down La Seine.

862
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:32,509
- It's a nice thing.
- Okay.

863
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:35,429
- So you're flying back to New York?
- Yeah, yeah.

864
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:41,185
So I read in that article
that you're married with a kid.

865
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:45,105
- That's great.
- Yeah, he's, um — he's four.

866
00:42:45,189 --> 00:42:47,399
- What's his name?
- Henry. Little Hank.

867
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:50,361
- He's so much fun.
- Oh, wow. I'm sure.

868
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:53,364
- And your wife? What does she do?
- She teaches elementary school.

869
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,950
- Do you have kids?
- Yes, two.

870
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,117
- Shit!
- What?

871
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:59,161
I left them in the car,
with the windows up.

872
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,247
It was six months ago.
Do you think they're okay?

873
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,791
No, I'm kidding.
No, but I want to have kids someday.

874
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:05,876
- I'm just not ready yet.
- No?

875
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,171
- Yeah, I'm in a good relationship though.
- Oh, yeah? That's good.

876
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,548
- What's he do?
- He's a photojournalist.

877
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:13,259
He does war coverage.

878
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:16,720
He's away a lot, which in a way
is good for me 'cause I'm so busy.

879
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:20,599
But isn't it dangerous? Aren't a lot
of those guys getting killed these days?

880
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:23,936
He promises me he doesn't take risks.
But I often worry.

881
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,647
He goes in this trance when he
starts to photograph something.

882
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,190
What do you mean?

883
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,986
Well, once we were in New Delhi, and we
passed a bum lying down on the sidewalk.

884
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:33,570
- A bomb?
- A bum.

885
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,531
- A bum. (LAUGHS) All right.
- A homeless.

886
00:43:35,614 --> 00:43:39,451
Anyway, he looked like he needed help,
but his first reaction was to photograph him.

887
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:43,038
He went, like, really close to his face,
fixing his collar to make it look better.

888
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,832
He was totally detached from the person.

889
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:47,751
But don't you have to be like that
to be good at that job?

890
00:43:47,835 --> 00:43:50,921
Yeah, I mean, I'm not, you know —
I'm not judging him for it.

891
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:54,550
What he does is essential and incredible.
I'm saying I could never do it.

892
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:56,844
- Let's get on that boat. Come on.
- No!

893
00:43:56,927 --> 00:43:59,430
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- You don't have time! We gotta go.

894
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:02,200
Looks like they're about to take off.
Look, I've got 15 more minutes.

895
00:44:02,224 --> 00:44:03,684
- Do you have a cell phone?
- Yeah.

896
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:06,353
I got that driver guy's number,
and I can call him,

897
00:44:06,437 --> 00:44:08,897
and they can pick us up
at whatever the next stop is.

898
00:44:08,981 --> 00:44:11,584
I've never been on those boats.
It's for tourists. It's embarrassing.

899
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,444
Come on. Okay. All right.

900
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:17,072
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

901
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:19,658
- No, I'll get it. I'll get it.
- No, no.

902
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:21,368
All right, all right, all right.

903
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:23,996
(FRENCH CONTINUES)

904
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,373
- Okay.
- Thank you.

905
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:29,001
- So, you in love with that guy?
- What guy?

906
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:31,045
The war photographer. <i>Merci.</i>

907
00:44:31,128 --> 00:44:33,255
- Yes, of course.
- Your change. Bon voyage.

908
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:34,840
<i>Merci.</i>

909
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:38,677
So, do you have that cell phone?

910
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,596
Oh, yeah.

911
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,598
- Okay.
- Okay.

912
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:46,518
- All right, what do I tell him?
- Tell him to pick you up at <i>Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

913
00:44:46,602 --> 00:44:49,355
Ah, shit. Kay...

914
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:52,316
<i>Henri Quatre. Quai Henri Quatre.</i>

915
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,443
<i>Henri Quatre.</i>

916
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,029
What's wrong with you?
No, do you want me to —

917
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,530
<i>- Henri Quatre.</i>
- Henry Four?

918
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,449
- Yes!
- Come on. Why didn't you say so?

919
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,451
I'm sorry! Okay.

920
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,548
JESSE: Yeah. Is this Philippe?

921
00:45:16,632 --> 00:45:19,134
Yeah. Philippe, this is Jesse Wallace.

922
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:20,928
Yeah.

923
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:24,306
Well, listen,
I'm on one of those boats, right?

924
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:30,270
And we're gonna arrive
at Henri Four, at port Henri Four.

925
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:32,773
You know what that is? All right. Great.

926
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:34,817
And you have my bags, right?

927
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,736
Yeah, so we'll be there in —
I don't know. It's the next stop.

928
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,446
Okay. <i>Au revoir.</i>

929
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,283
- It's okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

930
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:46,787
- Thanks.
- Oh, wow! Notre-Dame, man.

931
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,997
- Check that out.
- Oh, wow.

932
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,835
I heard this story once about when
the Germans were occupying Paris

933
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,837
and they had to retreat back.

934
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,797
They wired Notre-Dame to blow.

935
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,343
But they had to leave one guy
in charge of hitting the switch.

936
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:04,471
And the guy, the soldier,
he couldn't do it.

937
00:46:04,555 --> 00:46:08,475
You know, he just sat there, knocked out
by how beautiful the place was.

938
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:10,436
And then when the Allied troops came in,

939
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:14,148
they found all the explosives just lying there
and the switch unturned.

940
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:17,985
They found the same thing
at the Sacré-Coeur, Eiffel Tower.

941
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,487
Couple of other places, I think.

942
00:46:20,571 --> 00:46:22,656
Is that true?

943
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:25,742
I don't know.
I always liked the story though.

944
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:27,327
Yeah, that's a great story.

945
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:30,497
But you have to think that Notre-Dame
will be gone one day.

946
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:33,292
There used to be another church
or cathedral at the Seine.

947
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:35,127
- Right there.
- Right in the same spot?

948
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,753
Yeah.

949
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:38,338
Hmm.

950
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:40,841
You know, this is great.
I've never done this.

951
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:43,552
- Yeah.
- I forget about how beautiful Paris is.

952
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:46,875
- This isn't so bad, being a tourist, huh?
- Thank you for getting me on the boat.

953
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:48,265
You're welcome.

954
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:51,602
I think that book that I wrote in a way
was like building something

955
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:55,689
so that I wouldn't forget the details
of the time that we spent together.

956
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:59,776
You know, like, just as a reminder
that once we really did meet.

957
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,155
You know, that this was real,
this happened.

958
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:06,450
I'm happy you're saying that
because I always feel like a freak

959
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,411
because I'm never able
to move on like this, you know.

960
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:13,832
People just have an affair
or even entire relationships.

961
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:16,502
They break up and they forget.

962
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:19,880
They move on like they would
have changed brand of cereals.

963
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:24,384
I feel I was never able to forget
anyone I've been with.

964
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:30,140
Because each person
had their own specific qualities.

965
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:32,559
You can never replace anyone.

966
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:34,645
What is lost is lost.

967
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:38,607
Each relationship, when it ends,
really damages me.

968
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:40,567
I never fully recover.

969
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:42,694
That's why I'm very careful
with getting involved,

970
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:45,989
because... it hurts too much.

971
00:47:46,073 --> 00:47:48,659
Even getting laid,
I actually don't do that,

972
00:47:48,742 --> 00:47:52,496
because I will miss of the person
the most mundane things.

973
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:54,665
Like I'm obsessed with little things.

974
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:58,001
Maybe I'm crazy,
but when I was a little girl,

975
00:47:58,085 --> 00:48:01,088
my mom told me
that I was always late to school.

976
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,590
One day she followed me to see why.

977
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:07,010
I was looking at chestnuts
falling from the trees,

978
00:48:07,094 --> 00:48:08,929
rolling on the sidewalk,

979
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:10,639
or ants crossing the road,

980
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:14,101
the way a leaf cast a shadow
on a tree trunk.

981
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:16,520
Little things.

982
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,564
I think it's the same with people.

983
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:21,942
I see in them little details,
so specific to each of them

984
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:25,445
that move me and that I miss
and will always miss.

985
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:28,031
You can never replace anyone

986
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:31,034
because everyone is made
of such beautiful, specific details.

987
00:48:35,497 --> 00:48:38,834
Like I remember the way
your beard has a bit of red in it...

988
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:44,256
and how the sun was making it glow
that morning right before you left.

989
00:48:46,216 --> 00:48:49,219
I remembered that, and I missed it.

990
00:48:50,387 --> 00:48:52,347
Really crazy, right?

991
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:56,143
Now I know for sure. You want to know
why I wrote that stupid book?

992
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:57,144
Why?

993
00:48:57,227 --> 00:48:59,271
So that you might come
to a reading in Paris,

994
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:02,399
and I could walk up to you and ask,
"Where the fuck were you?"

995
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,276
(CELINE CHUCKLES)

996
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,445
No, you think I'd be here today?

997
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:10,991
I'm serious. I think I wrote it,
in a way, to try to find you.

998
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:14,828
Okay, that's — I know that's not true,
but that's sweet of you to say.

999
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:18,457
I think it is true. What do you think
the chances were of us ever meeting again?

1000
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,501
After that December, I'd say almost zero.

1001
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,130
But we're not real anyway, right?

1002
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:28,592
We're just characters
in that old lady's dream.

1003
00:49:28,675 --> 00:49:30,802
She's on her deathbed,
fantasizing about her youth.

1004
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:33,221
So of course we had to meet again.

1005
00:49:33,305 --> 00:49:37,225
Oh, God. Why weren't you there in Vienna?

1006
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:40,687
- I told you why.
- I know why.

1007
00:49:40,771 --> 00:49:42,189
I just...

1008
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:44,650
I wish you would have been.

1009
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:47,194
Our lives might have been
so much different.

1010
00:49:47,277 --> 00:49:49,446
Do you think so?

1011
00:49:49,529 --> 00:49:51,156
I actually do.

1012
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:54,493
Maybe not. Maybe we would have
hated each other eventually.

1013
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,745
What, like we hate each other now?

1014
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:03,085
Maybe we're...
we're only good at brief encounters,

1015
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:05,212
walking around in European cities.

1016
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:06,838
In warm climate.

1017
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:11,009
Oh, God. Why didn't we
exchange phone numbers and stuff?

1018
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:13,428
Why didn't we do that?

1019
00:50:13,512 --> 00:50:16,014
Because we were young and stupid.

1020
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:18,433
Do you think we still are?

1021
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:20,936
I guess when you're young,
you just believe

1022
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:23,355
there'll be many people
with whom you'll connect with.

1023
00:50:24,106 --> 00:50:26,426
And later in life, you realize
it only happens a few times.

1024
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:28,485
Yeah. And you can screw it up, you know?

1025
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,445
Misconnect.

1026
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:33,448
Well, the past is the past.
It was meant to be that way.

1027
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:36,034
You really believe that?
That everything's fated?

1028
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:40,163
Well, you know, the world
might be less free than we think.

1029
00:50:40,247 --> 00:50:42,249
Yeah?

1030
00:50:42,332 --> 00:50:44,751
Yeah. When given
these exact circumstances,

1031
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:46,586
that's what will happen every time.

1032
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:49,506
Two part hydrogen, one part oxygen,
you'll get water every time.

1033
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:53,135
No, no. I mean, what if your grandmother
had lived a week longer, you know?

1034
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:55,762
Or passed away a week earlier? Days, even.

1035
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:57,848
Things might have been different.
I believe that.

1036
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,558
You can't think like that.

1037
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:01,977
I know you shouldn't on most things, but...

1038
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,605
it's just, on this one, it seemed
like something was off, you know?

1039
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:09,568
I mean... in the months leading up
to my wedding, okay,

1040
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:11,445
I was thinking about you all the time.

1041
00:51:11,528 --> 00:51:13,697
Even on my way there, I'm in the car,

1042
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,741
and a buddy of mine
is driving me downtown,

1043
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:17,492
and I'm staring out the window.

1044
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:20,746
I think I see you not far
from the church, right?

1045
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:23,457
Folding up an umbrella
and walking into a deli

1046
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:27,210
on the corner of 13th and Broadway.

1047
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:30,922
And I thought I was going crazy.
But now I think it probably was you.

1048
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:33,717
I lived on 11th and Broadway.

1049
00:51:35,343 --> 00:51:36,845
You see?

1050
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:42,058
So, what is it like to be married?
You haven't talked much about that.

1051
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,644
I haven't?

1052
00:51:44,728 --> 00:51:46,813
How weird.

1053
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:51,109
I don't know. We met, you know,
when I was in college.

1054
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:55,405
And we broke up and got back together
for a period of years.

1055
00:51:55,489 --> 00:51:56,990
And then...

1056
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,661
What — We were sort of back together
and she was pregnant...

1057
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,748
so marriage.

1058
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:06,875
What is she like?

1059
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,419
She's a great teacher, a good mom.

1060
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:12,047
Uh, she's smart, pretty.

1061
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:17,803
I remember thinking at the time that
so many of the men that I admired most,

1062
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:23,058
you know, that their lives were dedicated
to something greater than themselves.

1063
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:26,645
So you got married because men
you admired were married?

1064
00:52:26,728 --> 00:52:28,396
No, no.

1065
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,026
It's more like I had this idea
of my best self, you know?

1066
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:35,111
And I wanted to pursue that

1067
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,823
even if it might have been
overriding my honest self.

1068
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,533
You know what I'm saying?

1069
00:52:39,616 --> 00:52:42,118
It's funny. Like, in the moment,
I remember thinking

1070
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:44,329
that it didn't much matter,
the who of it all.

1071
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:46,957
That nobody is gonna be everything to you

1072
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,085
and that ultimately, it's just
the simple action of committing yourself,

1073
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:53,505
meeting your responsibilities
that — that matters.

1074
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:57,384
I mean, what is love, right,
if it's not respect, trust, admiration?

1075
00:52:57,467 --> 00:53:00,554
And I — I felt all those things.

1076
00:53:00,637 --> 00:53:03,932
So, cut to the present tense
and I feel like I'm running a small nursery

1077
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,518
with somebody I used to date, you know?

1078
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,645
I mean, I'm like a monk, you know?

1079
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:12,816
I mean, I've had sex less
than ten times in the last four years.

1080
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,192
(LAUGHING)

1081
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:16,236
- What? What? You laughing at me?
- No.

1082
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,946
It sounds pathetic?

1083
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:20,699
What monastery do the monk
have sex ten times?

1084
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:23,201
You're right.
I'm doing better than most monks.

1085
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:28,206
But I do. I feel like if somebody were to
touch me, I would dissolve into molecules.

1086
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,126
We're here. We've gotta go. Come on.

1087
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,086
Shit. (SIGHS)

1088
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,882
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1089
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,635
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

1090
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:42,220
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1091
00:53:43,597 --> 00:53:45,390
Oh, it's there.

1092
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:48,810
- I'm sorry to hear that, you know —
- What?

1093
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:51,938
you're not that happy with your marriage.

1094
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:54,816
- This friend of mine, she's a shrink —
- How's she doing?

1095
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,484
She's a mess, but —

1096
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:59,571
No, she was telling me that she's
been dealing with a lot of couples

1097
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:01,656
that are breaking up
for the same exact reason.

1098
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,074
What reason is that?

1099
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:05,469
All those couples expected
after a few years of living together

1100
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:08,389
for the passion, that consuming desire,
to be the same than in the beginning.

1101
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,558
- Yeah, right. I know that.
- It's impossible. And thank God!

1102
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:14,461
Otherwise, we would end up with aneurysms
if we were in that constant state of excitement.

1103
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,838
We would end up
doing nothing at all with our lives.

1104
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:19,007
Do you think you would
have finished your book

1105
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,930
if you were fucking someone
every five minutes?

1106
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:23,261
I might have welcomed the challenge.

1107
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:26,389
But you know, it's natural for your wife,
after the birth of your son.

1108
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:28,934
- She has to give all her love to the little one.
- Of course.

1109
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:32,145
Imagine if she was totally obsessed with sex,
riding you like a wild cat.

1110
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:34,147
That wouldn't make any sense, right?

1111
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,859
Everything you're saying makes sense.
It's not about sex.

1112
00:54:37,943 --> 00:54:40,320
No, I know. It's obvious.

1113
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:41,905
I, uh —

1114
00:54:42,989 --> 00:54:46,242
You know, couples are so confused lately.

1115
00:54:46,326 --> 00:54:50,330
I think it must be
that men need to feel essential,

1116
00:54:50,413 --> 00:54:52,040
and they don't anymore.

1117
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:57,504
Because it's been imprinted in their head for
so many years that they had to be the provider.

1118
00:54:57,587 --> 00:55:01,132
Like, I'm a strong, independent woman
in my professional life.

1119
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:03,134
I don't need a man to feed me,

1120
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:07,764
but I still need a man to love me
and that I could love, you know.

1121
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:10,517
- So, uh, your driver's here.
- Yeah.

1122
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,269
Well, I guess this is good-bye.
You better give me your —

1123
00:55:13,353 --> 00:55:16,731
No, why don't we just give you a ride home,
wherever you're going, huh?

1124
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:18,650
Well, I can take the Metro. I'm fine.

1125
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:22,487
No, no. My flight's not until 10:00.
They've got me arriving two hours early.

1126
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:25,907
- This way we can keep talking. Monsieur.
- It's not really on the way.

1127
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:29,119
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1128
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:32,831
- JESSE: <i>Oui.</i>
- DRIVER: <i>Oui.</i> (SPEAKS FRENCH)

1129
00:55:39,796 --> 00:55:41,214
<i>Merci.</i>

1130
00:55:41,297 --> 00:55:43,633
So you told him where you are
and all that jazz?

1131
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:47,887
Yeah. (FRENCH)

1132
00:55:47,971 --> 00:55:50,390
- So he knows where he's going?
- Yes.

1133
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,559
- Glad somebody does.
- (CELINE LAUGHS)

1134
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:54,811
No, but this is better
than the Metro, right?

1135
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:57,230
Definitely.

1136
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,695
CELINE: I was thinking, for me it's better
I don't romanticize things as much anymore.

1137
00:56:03,778 --> 00:56:05,780
I was suffering so much all the time.

1138
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:09,284
I still have lots of dreams,
but they're not in regard to my love life.

1139
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,870
It doesn't make me sad.
It's just the way it is.

1140
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:15,248
Is that why you're in a relationship
with somebody who's never around?

1141
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:16,624
(CHUCKLES)

1142
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:20,378
Yes, obviously I can't deal with
the day-to-day life of a relationship.

1143
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:22,756
Yeah, we have this exciting time together,

1144
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:26,217
and then he leaves, and I miss him,
but at least I'm not dying inside.

1145
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:28,678
When someone is always around me,
I'm, like, suffocating.

1146
00:56:28,762 --> 00:56:31,765
No. Wait. You just said that you need
to love and be loved.

1147
00:56:31,848 --> 00:56:34,851
Yeah, but when I do,
it quickly makes me nauseous.

1148
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,644
It's a disaster.

1149
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:39,397
I mean, I'm really happy
only when I'm on my own.

1150
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:44,319
Even being alone, it's better than
sitting next to a lover and feeling lonely.

1151
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:47,155
It's not so easy for me to be a romantic.

1152
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:50,784
You start off that way, and after
you've been screwed over a few times,

1153
00:56:50,867 --> 00:56:55,830
you forget about all your delusional ideas
and you just take what comes into your life.

1154
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:58,333
That's not even true.
I haven't been screwed over.

1155
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:01,002
I've just had too many blah relationships.

1156
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:03,004
They weren't mean. They cared for me.

1157
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:06,674
But there was no real connection
or excitement.

1158
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:08,885
At least, not from my side.

1159
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,846
God, I'm sorry. Is it really that bad?

1160
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,890
It's not, right?

1161
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,185
You know, it's not even that.

1162
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,312
I was... I was fine

1163
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,231
until I read your fucking book.

1164
00:57:22,023 --> 00:57:23,983
It stirred shit up, you know?

1165
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:28,822
It reminded me how genuinely romantic I was,
how I had so much hope in things.

1166
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:32,450
And now it's like I don't believe in anything
that relates to love.

1167
00:57:32,534 --> 00:57:34,619
I don't feel things for people anymore.

1168
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:39,624
In a way, I put all my romanticism
into that one night,

1169
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:42,752
and I was never able
to feel all this again.

1170
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:45,296
Like somehow this night
took things away from me.

1171
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,715
I expressed them to you,
and you took them with you.

1172
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:50,009
It made me feel cold,
like if love wasn't for me.

1173
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:52,345
I don't believe that.
I don't believe that.

1174
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:57,934
You know what? Reality and love
are almost contradictory for me.

1175
00:57:58,017 --> 00:57:59,185
It's funny.

1176
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:02,438
Every single of my exes,
they're now married.

1177
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:05,358
Men go out with me, we break up,
and then they get married.

1178
00:58:05,441 --> 00:58:08,403
Later they call me to thank me
for teaching them what love is —

1179
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:09,487
Oh, God.

1180
00:58:09,571 --> 00:58:11,739
and that I taught them
to care and respect women.

1181
00:58:11,823 --> 00:58:14,284
- I think I'm one of those guys.
- I want to kill them!

1182
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:16,035
Why didn't they ask me to marry them?

1183
00:58:16,119 --> 00:58:18,538
I would have said no,
but at least they could have asked!

1184
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:22,083
But it's my fault. I know it's my fault
because I never felt it was the right man.

1185
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:23,543
Never.

1186
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:27,046
But what does it mean, the right man?
The love of your life? The concept is absurd.

1187
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:31,092
The idea that we can only be complete
with another person is evil, right?

1188
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:32,177
Can I talk?

1189
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,346
I guess I've been heartbroken too many times,
and then I recovered.

1190
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:38,266
So now, you know, from the start,
I make no effort

1191
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,935
- because I know it's not gonna work out.
- You can't do that.

1192
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:44,189
You can't live your life trying to avoid pain
at the expense of engaging —

1193
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:46,649
Those are words.
I've gotta get away from you.

1194
00:58:46,733 --> 00:58:49,944
- Stop the car. I want to get out.
- No, no. Don't get out.

1195
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:52,298
- Keep talking.
- It's being around you — Don't touch me!

1196
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:56,117
I want to get on a cab. (SPEAKING FRENCH)

1197
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:59,954
No, no, no. Keep going. No, listen.
I'm just so happy —

1198
00:59:00,038 --> 00:59:02,457
Thank you. Just keep going.

1199
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,168
- All right.
- (SIGHS)

1200
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:09,547
Look, I'm just so happy, all right,
to be with you.

1201
00:59:09,631 --> 00:59:12,425
I am. I'm so glad
you didn't forget about me.

1202
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:15,887
- Okay?
- No, I didn't. And it pisses me off, okay?

1203
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,266
You come here to Paris,
all romantic and married, okay?

1204
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,101
Screw you.

1205
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:24,812
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not trying to get you or anything.

1206
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:27,232
I mean, all I need is a married man.

1207
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:29,525
And there's been so much
water under the bridge.

1208
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,110
It's not even about you anymore.

1209
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:33,881
It's about that time, that moment in time
that is forever gone. I don't know.

1210
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:37,033
You say all that, but you didn't
even remember having sex, so...

1211
00:59:37,116 --> 00:59:38,952
Of course I remembered.

1212
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:43,581
- You did?
- Yes.

1213
00:59:43,665 --> 00:59:46,042
Women pretend things like that.
I don't know.

1214
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,753
- They do?
- Yeah, what was I supposed to say?

1215
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,339
That I remember the wine in the park

1216
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:55,009
and us looking up at the stars fading away
as the sun came up?

1217
00:59:55,093 --> 00:59:57,136
We had sex twice, you idiot!

1218
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:03,643
All right. You know what?
I'm just happy to see you.

1219
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:07,397
Even if you've become
an angry, manic-depressive activist.

1220
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,233
I still like you.
I still enjoy being around you.

1221
01:00:11,609 --> 01:00:13,236
And I feel the same.

1222
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:17,532
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.
I just — I had to let it all out.

1223
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:19,075
Don't worry about it.

1224
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,619
I'm so miserable in my love life,
in my relationship.

1225
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:24,747
I always act as, like,
you know, I'm detached.

1226
01:00:24,831 --> 01:00:26,874
But I'm dying inside.

1227
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:28,584
I'm dying because I'm so numb.

1228
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:32,046
I don't feel pain or excitement.
I'm not even bitter. I'm just, uh —

1229
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,882
You think you're the one dying inside?

1230
01:00:34,966 --> 01:00:38,386
My life is 24/7 bad.

1231
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,763
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. God.

1232
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:43,933
The only happiness I get
is when I'm out with my son.

1233
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:45,852
I've been to marriage counseling.

1234
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:48,563
I've done things
I never thought I would have to do.

1235
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,649
I've lit candles,
bought self-help books, lingerie.

1236
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:54,193
- Did the candles help?
- Hell, no.

1237
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:56,779
I don't love her
the way she needs to be loved.

1238
01:00:56,863 --> 01:00:58,865
I don't even see a future for us.

1239
01:00:58,948 --> 01:01:03,244
But then I look at my little boy
sitting at the table across from me,

1240
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:07,457
and I think I would suffer any torture
to be with him for all the minutes of his life.

1241
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,667
I don't want to miss out on one.

1242
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:13,963
But then there's no joy or laughter
in my home, you know?

1243
01:01:14,047 --> 01:01:17,258
- And I don't want him growing up in that.
- No laughter?

1244
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:20,053
That's terrible. My parents
have been together for 35 years.

1245
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:22,805
Even when they have a bad fight,
they end up laughing like crazy.

1246
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:27,143
I don't want to be one of those people
who are getting divorced at 52,

1247
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:29,062
falling down into tears,

1248
01:01:29,145 --> 01:01:31,522
admitting that they never
really loved their spouse

1249
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:36,277
and they feel their life has been sucked up
into a vacuum cleaner.

1250
01:01:36,361 --> 01:01:40,073
You know, I want a great life.
I want her to have a great life.

1251
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:42,450
She deserves that, all right?

1252
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:45,828
But we're just living in the pretense
of a marriage, responsibility.

1253
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:50,166
You know, all these, just, ideas
of how people are supposed to live.

1254
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:54,837
But then I... I have these dreams.

1255
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:58,716
What dreams?

1256
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,802
I have these dreams, you know,

1257
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:04,764
that, um... I'm standing on a platform,

1258
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,310
and you keep going by on a train,

1259
01:02:09,394 --> 01:02:14,023
and you go by, and you go by,
and you go by, you go by.

1260
01:02:14,107 --> 01:02:16,109
And I wake up with the fucking sweats.

1261
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:18,277
And then I have this other dream

1262
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:22,323
where you're pregnant in bed
beside me, naked.

1263
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:25,243
I want so badly to touch you,
but you tell me not to.

1264
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:26,953
And then you look away.

1265
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:31,958
And I touch you anyway,
right on your ankle.

1266
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,628
And your skin is so soft
that I wake up in sobs. All right?

1267
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:40,091
My wife is sitting there, looking at me,
and I feel like I'm a million miles from her.

1268
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,677
And I know that there's something wrong,

1269
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,763
that I — God, that I can't
keep living like this,

1270
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:48,933
that there's gotta be something more
to love than commitment.

1271
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:54,021
But then I think that I might have given up
on the whole idea of romantic love,

1272
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:59,318
that I might have put it to bed
that day when you weren't there.

1273
01:03:00,695 --> 01:03:03,197
You know, I think I might have done that.

1274
01:03:04,532 --> 01:03:06,784
Why are you telling me all this?

1275
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:09,787
I'm sorry. I don't know.

1276
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,873
I — I shouldn't — I —

1277
01:03:13,124 --> 01:03:15,251
I shouldn't have.

1278
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:16,961
You know, it's so weird.

1279
01:03:17,044 --> 01:03:20,965
People think they are the only ones
going through tough times.

1280
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:24,427
I mean, when I read the article,
I thought your life was perfect.

1281
01:03:25,803 --> 01:03:28,598
A wife, a kid, published author.

1282
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:32,602
But your personal life
is more of a mess than mine.

1283
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:35,521
- (GROANS)
- I'm sorry.

1284
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:38,608
I'm glad it's good for something.

1285
01:03:38,691 --> 01:03:41,819
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1286
01:03:42,445 --> 01:03:44,739
- This is where you live?
- Yeah.

1287
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:50,495
So, are you just relieved that I'm
in even more deep shit than you are?

1288
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:52,914
CELINE: Yes. You've made me feel better.

1289
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:55,041
- Oh, good. I'm glad.
- (LAUGHS) No.

1290
01:03:55,124 --> 01:03:57,627
No, I really wish you the best.

1291
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:01,339
It's not because I'm incapable
of having a good relationship or a family

1292
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:03,841
that I wish everyone to be doomed like me.

1293
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:06,385
I'm sure you'll be a great mom someday.

1294
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:07,970
Really? You think so?

1295
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:10,932
Yeah, a few antidepressants,
you know, you'll do great.

1296
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:13,226
Oh, no. Okay, say stop.

1297
01:04:13,309 --> 01:04:15,311
Stop. Yay!

1298
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,896
- Okay.
- You ready?

1299
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:17,980
Okay.

1300
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:30,493
So, I want to try something.

1301
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:32,078
What?

1302
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:38,000
I want to see if you stay together
or if you dissolve into molecules.

1303
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:42,129
How am I doing?

1304
01:04:42,213 --> 01:04:43,714
Still here.

1305
01:04:44,423 --> 01:04:46,551
Good. I like being here.

1306
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:52,139
Is this your apartment?

1307
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,058
No, I live down there.

1308
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,768
- Down there?
- Yeah.

1309
01:04:55,851 --> 01:04:58,854
Uh, monsieur.
I'm gonna walk her to her door.

1310
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:01,440
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

1311
01:05:08,114 --> 01:05:11,242
This is incredible.
This is where you live?

1312
01:05:11,325 --> 01:05:13,619
- Yeah.
- How long have you been here?

1313
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:16,539
- Four years.
- Wow.

1314
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:19,375
- So tell me...
- What?

1315
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:23,421
Is it all true about your dreams,
or did you say that to hopefully get in my pants?

1316
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:26,757
Oh, I just said that to get in your pants.
I use that all the time.

1317
01:05:26,841 --> 01:05:28,759
Oh, okay. Does it work?

1318
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:30,845
Ah, you know. Sometimes.

1319
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:34,098
(GASPS) Here's my kitty.

1320
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:36,392
Oh, so cute! Look at him.

1321
01:05:36,475 --> 01:05:38,477
You know what I love about this cat?

1322
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:40,730
Every morning,
I bring him down to the courtyard,

1323
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:45,735
and every single morning,
he looks at everything like it was the first time.

1324
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:49,155
Every corner, every tree, every plant.

1325
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:52,742
(GASPS) Smells everything
with his little cute nose.

1326
01:05:52,825 --> 01:05:54,827
Oh, I love my kitty!

1327
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,079
I love my kitty.

1328
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,915
- What's his name?
- Che.

1329
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,501
- Che?
- (SQUEALS)

1330
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:04,045
Uh-huh.

1331
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,130
- What?
- Commie.

1332
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:08,007
- (LAUGHS)
- Yeah.

1333
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,093
