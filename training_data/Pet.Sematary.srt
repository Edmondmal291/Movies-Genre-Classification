1
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,868
<i>Bye, old Shep.
See you in heaven, yeah?</i>

2
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,554
<i>This is where my kitty lays,</i>

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,222
<i>no more he screams and hollers.</i>

4
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:00,721
<i>He lived for five and twenty days,</i>

5
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,518
<i>he cost me $50.</i>

6
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,107
<i>Spot, a good fellow. We love you.</i>

7
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,359
- Finally here.
- Yeah.

8
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,869
So?

9
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,837
- What do you think?
- It's gorgeous.

10
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,149
Decided to wake up
and see what home looks like?

11
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,903
Come here.

12
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,749
Mommy! Daddy! I see a path!

13
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,961
Ellie, be careful.

14
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,793
Ellie!

15
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,387
Listen to your...

16
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,138
Mommy! Daddy! It hurts!

17
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,392
Mommy! Daddy! It hurts!

18
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,939
- Are you okay?
- It hurts.

19
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,607
- Get rid of this.
- I got it, I got it.

20
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,854
Look out.

21
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,047
- You okay?
- It's all right.

22
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,028
No. It hurts.

23
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,400
Anyone who can scream that loud

24
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,153
isn't ready
for intensive care just yet.

25
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,990
Cat.

26
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,170
She's just skinned her knee.

27
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,838
I don't want the stingy stuff, Daddy.

28
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,098
Where's Gage?

29
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,304
Gage!

30
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,141
Gage!

31
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,936
No, you don't, my friend.
Not in that road.

32
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,067
- Gage!
- I corralled him for you, missus.

33
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,615
Thank you. Thank you so much.

34
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,113
- Thank you. I'm Louis Creed.
- Jud Crandall.

35
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,832
I live just across the road.

36
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,375
You want to watch out for that road.

37
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,748
Them damn trucks go back and forth,
all day and most of the night.

38
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,254
And who might you be, little miss?

39
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,804
I'm Ellen Creed.

40
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,309
And your dad's going to be
the new doctor at the college, I hear.

41
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,638
I think you're gonna be just as happy
as a clam here, Ellen Creed.

42
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,519
Are clams really happy?

43
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,691
Mr. Crandall,
there's a path over there.

44
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,396
Do you know where it goes?

45
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,242
Yeah, that's a good story.
And a good walk.

46
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,624
I'll take you up there sometime.
Tell you the story, too,

47
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,712
- after you get settled in.
- Great.

48
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,835
Excuse me,
I've got to get this kid changed.

49
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,508
- It was nice to meet you.
- Same here.

50
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,052
Come on, Ellie. Give me your hand.

51
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,886
The house has stood empty too long.

52
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,763
It's damn good
to see people in it again.

53
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,818
Church!

54
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,567
You scared the life out of me, Church.

55
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,121
Come here.

56
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,888
- That you, Doc?
- Yeah, it's me.

57
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,761
Well, come on up and have a beer.

58
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,104
- Need a glass?
- Not at all.

59
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,489
Good for you.

60
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,288
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

61
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,616
That's one mean road, all right.

62
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,129
You know that path
your wife commented on?

63
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,669
That road, and those Orinco trucks
are the two main reasons it's there.

64
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,385
Well, where does it lead?

65
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:21,639
- Pet cemetery.
- Pet cemetery.

66
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,642
It's that damn road.
Uses up a lot of animals.

67
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,980
- Dogs and cats, mostly.
- My little girl's got a cat.

68
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,571
Winston Churchill.
We call him Church for short.

69
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,322
I'd get him fixed, if I were you.

70
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,028
Fixed cat don't tend to wander.

71
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,726
If he's all the time
crossing back and forth on that road,

72
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,494
- his luck will run out.
- Well, I'll take it under advisement.

73
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,294
Meantime, Doc, here's to your bones.

74
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:54,712
And your bones.

75
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,431
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

76
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,483
- I'll be going now, Dr. Creed.
- All right, Missy. Thanks.

77
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,236
- Hi, Missy.
- Hi.

78
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,690
I'll do these up, bring them back
next time, Mrs. Creed.

79
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,367
Great. Can you come on Monday, Missy?

80
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,243
Always thought it would be lucky
to marry a doctor.

81
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,829
Wish I had a doctor around
with my stomach pain so bad.

82
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,507
Guess I'll never be lucky.
Hell, I ain't married to anyone.

83
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,963
Bye, Missy.

84
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,192
Mommy, Daddy, come on, let's go!

85
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,227
We're coming.

86
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,324
All set? Let's get on with it.

87
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,206
There's the place.

88
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,284
What's it say, Mommy?

89
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,290
It says "Pet Sematary," honey.

90
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,747
It's misspelled,
but that's what it says.

91
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,130
Ellie, wait a minute!

92
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,881
I told you it was a bad road, Louis.

93
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,638
It's killed a lot of pets,
made a lot of kids unhappy.

94
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,683
At least something good come of it.
This place.

95
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,105
Couldn't plant nothing
but corpses here, anyway, I guess.

96
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,688
How can you call it a good thing?

97
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,489
A graveyard for pets
killed in the road

98
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,030
built by brokenhearted children.

99
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,880
Well, they have to learn
about death somehow,

100
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,657
- now, don't they, Mrs. Creed?
- Why?

101
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,294
- Can I have the baby?
- Yeah.

102
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,430
Daddy, look, this one's a goldfishy.

103
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,305
That's right, Ellie.
They wasn't all killed by the road,

104
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,060
especially the ones from
back in my time as a child.

105
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,482
They get older as you
go towards the middle. Harder to read.

106
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,614
Missy Ellen,
come over here just a minute.

107
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:29,947
That's where I buried my dog, Spot,
when he died of old age in 1924.

108
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,532
Ellie,

109
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,917
do you know
what a graveyard really is?

110
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,383
Well, I guess not.

111
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,508
It's a place where the dead speak.

112
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,383
No, not right out loud.

113
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,060
Their stones speak or their markers.

114
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,889
This ain't a scary place, Ellie.

115
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,975
It's a place of rest and speaking.

116
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,570
- Can you remember that?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,785
- Hi, babe.
- Daddy, what if Church dies?

118
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,793
What if he dies
and has to go to the Pet Sematary?

119
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,211
Honey, Church will be fine.

120
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,010
No, he won't. Not in the end.

121
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,214
In the end, he's going to croak,
isn't he?

122
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,389
Lovey...

123
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,932
Church might still be alive
when you're in high school

124
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,809
and that's a very long time.

125
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,642
It doesn't seem long to me.
It seems short.

126
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,524
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd let Church live to be a hundred,

127
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,320
but I don't make up the rules.

128
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,359
And who does? God, I suppose.

129
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:54,370
He's not God's cat, he's my cat.
Let God get his own if he wants one.

130
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,911
Not mine. Not mine.

131
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,492
Yuck! Gross!

132
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,824
Uh-oh.

133
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,580
I'm scared.

134
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,127
What if school here
isn't like in Chicago?

135
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,083
- I'm scared and I want to go home.
- You'll be all right, Ellie.

136
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,304
I don't want Church
to get his nuts cut, Daddy.

137
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,053
Good God, where did you hear that?

138
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,180
Missy Dandridge.
She says it's an operation.

139
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,103
The road is a lot more dangerous
than any operation.

140
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:05,562
Church will be just the same.
Well, almost the same.

141
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,942
And we won't have to worry about him

142
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,274
getting run over in the road
by trucks.

143
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,281
- Church'll be all right, honey.
- You promise, Daddy?

144
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,953
Don't shilly-shally, Louis.
Give the little girl a promise.

145
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,249
Church will be fine.

146
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,251
I promise.

147
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,804
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

148
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,307
But if anything does happen
while he's under the gas,

149
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,515
now, it's a one in a thousand shot,
but it does happen,

150
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,270
you explain it to her.

151
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,195
Church!

152
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,532
Got to go.

153
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,971
- Going to get his...
- Nuts cut. Yes.

154
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,556
Thank you, Missy,
for introducing that colorful phrase

155
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,609
- into my daughter's vocabulary.
- Don't mention it.

156
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,866
- How's that bellyache of yours?
- No better. No worse.

157
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,947
You know,
I can take a look at that for you.

158
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,578
It'll pass. They always do.

159
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,292
- Missy.
- Ma'am.

160
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,471
Still friends, Doc?

161
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,737
I kissed you.

162
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,070
Have a great first day at school, Doc.

163
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,534
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

164
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,035
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

165
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,331
- Did anybody see what happened?
- He got hit by a truck.

166
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,036
- God!
- His head.

167
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,794
- Hold him gently.
- Didn't even stop!

168
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,820
- There's so much blood!
- What the hell's going on?

169
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,461
- Get the door.
- Get Dr. Creed! Bring him up here.

170
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,637
What's happened here?

171
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,464
- He got hit by a truck.
- Oh, my God.

172
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,893
- Dr. Creed!
- Get them all out of here.

173
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,188
- Easy. Easy.
- All right. Everyone out, please.

174
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,018
Let the doctors do their work.

175
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,102
- Come on, let's clear the room here.
- Come on, everybody clear out!

176
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,689
- Just clear out!
- Ambu bag. Start a cardiac monitor.

177
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,695
- Yes, sir.
- Need large bores.

178
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,805
All right, get an ambulance here
and get it right now.

179
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,162
- He's got to go to EMC.
- It won't do any good.

180
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,351
I know it won't, but for God's sake,
let's do it by the rules.

181
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,616
Okay, now move.

182
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,670
- Mark, who is it?
- It's Pascow.

183
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,056
I told Rachel not so much
as a sprain today, my friend.

184
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,535
The soil

185
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:47,366
of a man's heart

186
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,167
is stonier,

187
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,336
Louis.

188
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,045
How did you know my name?

189
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,509
I'll come

190
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,178
to you.

191
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,184
How did you know my name?

192
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:54,809
Come on, Doc. We've got places to go.

193
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,836
Come on, Doc.
Don't make me tell you twice.

194
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,604
Hey, why are you here?

195
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,814
I want to help you because... Louis,

196
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,951
because you tried to help me.

197
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,887
- Let's go, Doc.
- I don't like this dream.

198
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,182
Who said you were dreaming?

199
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,486
This is the place
where the dead speak.

200
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,738
I want to wake up.
I want to wake up. That's all.

201
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,574
Don't go on, Doc.

202
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,870
No matter how much
you may feel you have to,

203
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:23,708
do not go on to the place

204
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,635
where the dead walk.

205
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,893
Please.

206
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,098
I just want to wake up, that's all.

207
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,392
I just want to wake up, that's all.

208
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:47,151
The barrier was not
meant to be crossed.

209
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,733
It's not my fault that you died.

210
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,577
You were as good as dead
when they brought you in.

211
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,747
The ground beyond

212
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,703
is sour.

213
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,274
You up, Doc?

214
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,361
Getting there.

215
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,471
Thanks, Nurse.

216
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,098
Louis, it's not right.

217
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,415
I don't like to think of you
rattling around the house

218
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,930
on Thanksgiving Day.

219
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,398
That's supposed to be
a family holiday, Louis.

220
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,736
That's why you're going with the kids
and without me.

221
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,189
As far as your dad is concerned,

222
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,010
I'm never going to be
a member of the family.

223
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,071
But I want you around.

224
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,029
I'll be around plenty
when you get back.

225
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,342
Hello.

226
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,426
<i>Louis, afraid you may have
a spot of trouble here.</i>

227
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,511
Jud. What trouble?

228
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,062
<i>Well, there's a dead cat over here,
on the edge of my lawn.</i>

229
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,358
- Oh, Jesus.
<i>- I think it might be your daughter's.</i>

230
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,413
Yup. That's Church all right.

231
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,966
I'm sorry.

232
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,759
At least it don't look
like he suffered.

233
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,683
Well, Ellie will suffer.
She'll suffer plenty.

234
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,476
Here. Give me that.

235
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,111
What are you going to do with it?

236
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,361
Put him in the garage, I guess.
I'll bury him in the morning.

237
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,245
You gonna tell Ellie?

238
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,873
Well, I'll have to mull that over
for a while.

239
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,200
Maybe when they call,

240
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,583
I'll just tell her I haven't seen
the damn cat around, you know?

241
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,710
I don't want to spoil her holiday,
and Rachel's.

242
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,588
Maybe there's a better way.

243
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,307
So, do we plant him
on the outside of the circle

244
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,268
- or do we start a new one?
- The place we're going

245
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,479
is on the other side of that.

246
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:02,030
We can't climb over that.
We'll break our necks.

247
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:06,081
No, we won't.
I've climbed it a time or two before.

248
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,499
I know all the places to step.

249
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,456
Just follow me.

250
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,334
Move easy.

251
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,846
Don't look down and don't stop.

252
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,975
If you stop,
you'll crash through for sure.

253
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,025
Just don't stop, and...

254
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,911
And don't look down. Right.

255
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,915
- Louis, you all right?
- Yeah.

256
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,589
I guess I just lost my happy thoughts
there for a second.

257
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,060
Not much farther now.

258
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:18,774
Jud, what's that?

259
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,953
Just a loon, that's all.

260
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,174
- Here we go.
- Won't be much longer now.

261
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,275
Just down here a little ways.

262
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,536
- Almost there, Louis.
- You keep saying that.

263
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,542
This time, I mean it.

264
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,680
What is this place?

265
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,893
This was their burial ground.

266
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:46,028
- Whose burial ground?
- Micmac Indians.

267
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,616
I brought you here
to bury Ellen's cat.

268
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,202
Why, for God's sake?

269
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,204
- I said why, Jud?
- I had my reasons.

270
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:05,676
The soil's thin, but you'll manage.

271
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,930
I'm going to sit over yonder
and have a smoke.

272
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:13,260
I'd help you,
but you got to do it yourself.

273
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,140
Each buries his own.

274
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,126
Hello.

275
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,956
Shit.

276
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,420
Louis?

277
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,340
- Louis?
- Yeah.

278
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,050
When you talk to them,

279
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,177
not one word
about what we done tonight.

280
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,972
What did we do tonight, Jud?

281
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,441
What we did, Louis,
was a secret thing.

282
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:56,287
Women are supposed to be the ones
who are good at keeping secrets.

283
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:00,333
But any woman who knows
anything at all will tell you

284
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,957
she's never seen into a man's heart.

285
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,087
The soil of a man's heart, Louis,
is stonier,

286
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:13,588
like the soil up there,
in the old Micmac burying ground.

287
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,329
<i>- Goldman residence.</i>
- Hi, Dory. It's Louis.

288
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,628
<i>- You want to talk to your daughter?</i>
- Yeah. That would be real fine.

289
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,212
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

290
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,548
How's everything in Chicago land?

291
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,349
Grandma and Grandpa
gave me all sorts of neat things.

292
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,722
How's Church, Daddy?

293
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,394
<i>Does he miss me?</i>

294
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,515
Well,

295
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,979
I guess he's just fine, Ellie.

296
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,023
I haven't seen him
this evening, but...

297
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,901
Well, make sure you put him down
in the cellar before you go to bed

298
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,153
so he won't run out in the road.

299
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,327
And kiss him good night for me.

300
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,202
Yuck. Kiss your own cat.

301
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,914
- Want to talk to Gage?
- Yeah.

302
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,676
Here.

303
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,674
Hi, Daddy. I love you.

304
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,887
<i>Hi, Daddy. I love you.</i>

305
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,925
Jesus.

306
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,973
Church.

307
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,735
Food, Church.

308
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,240
Food.

309
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,115
Come on, Church. Chow down.

310
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,409
Come on, Church.

311
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,463
Christ! I don't believe this.

312
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,471
You stink, Church.

313
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,553
Hold on a second.

314
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,898
Gosh, he chewed his way out.

315
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,567
Jesus, boy. Christ.

316
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,858
Damn it.

317
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,581
I'm trying to tell myself
that I buried him alive.

318
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,552
I'm not a vet.

319
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,426
- It was dark.
- Sure it was dark.

320
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:47,264
But his head swiveled on his neck
like it was full of ball bearings.

321
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,267
When you moved him,
he pulled out of the frost, Louis.

322
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,267
Sounded like a piece of ticky tape
coming off a letter.

323
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,398
Live things don't do that.

324
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,741
You only stop melting the frost under
where you're laying when you're dead.

325
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,487
Well, I feel like I'm going crazy.

326
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,546
It was the ragman
told me about the place.

327
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,124
He was half Micmac himself.

328
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,835
He knew how I felt about my dog, Spot.

329
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,177
Spot had got caught
in barbed wire that infected.

330
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:28,893
When he died,
I thought I was going to die.

331
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,981
<i>Ragman did for me
what I did for you last night.</i>

332
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,481
<i>Only I wasn't alone
when Spot came back.</i>

333
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,482
<i>My mother was with me.</i>

334
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,065
<i>You could still see
the barbed wire marks on him.</i>

335
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,784
Jud, come and get your dog!

336
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,206
He stinks of the ground
you buried him in!

337
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,703
Jud!

338
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,581
<i>Spot came back, all right.</i>

339
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,672
Spot!

340
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,089
<i>He was never quite the same dog
that I knew.</i>

341
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,795
Spot.

342
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,298
<i>When he died peacefully in the night,
that second time,</i>

343
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:05,129
<i>I buried him up there in the
Pet Sematary</i>

344
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,011
<i>where, as you saw,
his bones still lie.</i>

345
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,974
A man doesn't always
know why he does things, Louis.

346
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,182
I think I did it
'cause your daughter ain't ready

347
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:17,232
for her favorite pet to die.

348
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:21,567
Maybe, with more time,
she'll learn what death really is.

349
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,984
Which is where the pain stops
and the good memories begin.

350
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,531
Has anyone ever
buried a person up there?

351
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,458
Christ on his throne, no.
And who ever would?

352
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,116
Shit. How the hell
did you get in here?

353
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,453
Out!

354
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,252
Out!

355
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,802
Bye-bye, Ellie. Watch your step now.
There you go.

356
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:13,133
- Daddy!
- Hi, sugar.

357
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,888
Come here.

358
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,389
Hi, Daddy.

359
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,401
Daddy, is Church all right?

360
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,398
Yes. I guess so.

361
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,696
He was asleep on the porch
when I left.

362
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,325
- There you go.
- Because I had a dream about him.

363
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,622
I dreamed he got hit by a car,

364
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,743
and you and Mr. Crandall
buried him in the Pet Sematary.

365
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,620
That was a silly dream, wasn't it?

366
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,629
- Is he really all right?
- Yes.

367
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,343
- Hi, honey.
- You want to take your son, Doc?

368
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,947
You smell bad.

369
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,996
Can cats have shampoos?

370
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,897
Yes, but you have to take them to
someone who grooms animals, though,

371
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,503
and I think it's pretty expensive.

372
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,457
I don't care. I'll save up
my allowance and pay for it.

373
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,214
Church smells bad.

374
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,887
I'll cough up the money, Ellen.

375
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,970
- I hate that smell.
- Yes.

376
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,350
I hate it, too.

377
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,060
- And a red balloon...
- This is the yellow one.

378
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,881
And now, may the Lord bless you
and keep you.

379
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:54,085
May the Lord
make his face to shine upon you

380
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,592
and comfort you and lift you up

381
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,344
and give you peace.

382
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,391
- Amen.
- Amen.

383
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:12,103
- Rachel not feeling well?
- Well, just a touch of the flu.

384
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,404
She's in bed. She's been throwing up

385
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,233
ever since Mrs. Rogers called
and said Mrs. Dandridge...

386
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,158
That's enough, Ellie.

387
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,622
Hop in.

388
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,532
Poor Missy.

389
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,252
I don't know why God'd take
someone like her,

390
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,566
who should still have a bunch of years
left in front of her,

391
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,173
and lets an old fart like me
just go on and on.

392
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:36,427
My father used to have a saying, Jud.

393
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:40,973
"God sees the truth, but waits."

394
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,135
Yeah. How's your cat, Louis?

395
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:50,270
- It's Ellie's cat.
- No. It's your cat now.

396
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:00,360
<i>Possibly more Atlantic white-sided
dolphins have beached</i>

397
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,571
<i>or stranded themselves
along the Eastern Maine Coast</i>

398
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,747
<i>and scientists don't know why.</i>

399
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,415
What's up, sugar?

400
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,795
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge
went to heaven?

401
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,052
Do you want to talk about it?

402
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:25,427
- Is Missy in heaven, do you think?
- I don't know, honey.

403
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,805
Different people believe
all sorts of different things.

404
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,724
Some believe in heaven or hell.

405
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,652
Some think we come back
as little children

406
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,024
and some think we just wink out

407
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,196
like a candle flame
when the wind blows hard.

408
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,026
Do you believe that?

409
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,493
No.

410
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,246
I think we go on.

411
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:01,303
Yeah. I have faith in that.

412
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:04,632
- You believe in it.
- Give me a kiss.

413
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,769
What do you want to watch?

414
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:32,118
- I heard you and Ellie tonight.
- I thought you might have.

415
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:35,504
I know you don't approve
of the subject.

416
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:37,377
I just get scared.

417
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,668
And you know me.

418
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,301
When I get scared, I get defensive.

419
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,346
Scared of what? Dying?

420
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,735
- My sister, Zelda...
- I know, she died. Spinal meningitis.

421
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:04,157
She was in the back bedroom
like a dirty secret.

422
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:10,747
<i>My sister died in the back bedroom</i>

423
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:14,622
<i>and that's what she was.
A dirty secret.</i>

424
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,797
<i>I had to...
I had to feed her sometimes.</i>

425
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:21,375
<i>I hated it, but I did it.</i>

426
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:27,803
<i>We wanted her to die.
We wished for her to be dead.</i>

427
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,978
It wasn't just so
she wouldn't feel any more pain.

428
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,772
It was so we wouldn't
feel any more pain.

429
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,976
<i>It was because she started to look
like this monster.</i>

430
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,112
Even now, I wake up and I think,

431
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,149
"Is Zelda dead yet?"

432
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,569
"Is she?"

433
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,911
<i>My parents were gone when she died.</i>

434
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,869
Rachel.

435
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,133
<i>She started to...</i>

436
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,380
<i>She started to convulse
and I thought...</i>

437
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:11,467
<i>I thought, "Oh, my God, she's choking.
Zelda's choking.</i>

438
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,392
<i>"And they'll come home</i>

439
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,768
<i>"and they'll say
I murdered her by choking.</i>

440
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,021
<i>"They'll say, 'You hated her, Rachel.'
And that was true.</i>

441
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,478
<i>"And they'll say,
'You wanted her to be dead, '</i>

442
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,608
<i>"and that was true, too."</i>

443
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,071
<i>And then she died.</i>

444
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:34,031
<i>And I started to scream.
I ran out of the house screaming</i>

445
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:38,210
<i>"Zelda's dead! Zelda's dead!
Zelda's dead!"</i>

446
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,255
<i>And the neighbors,
they came out and they looked.</i>

447
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,795
They thought I was crying.

448
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,089
But you know something? I think maybe

449
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,383
I was laughing.

450
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,939
If you were, I salute you for it.

451
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,947
And if I ever needed another reason
not to like your mother and father,

452
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,323
I have one now.

453
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,994
You should never have been left alone
with her, Rachel.

454
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,826
Never. Where was a nurse?

455
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:22,746
They actually went out
and left an 8-year-old kid

456
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,797
in charge of her dying sister

457
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:27,467
who was probably
clinically insane by then.

458
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,925
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get you a Valium.

459
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:35,100
- But you know I don't take...
- Tonight, you do.

460
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,255
Look!

461
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,924
- He pulled.
- Daddy's flying a kite.

462
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,967
- Mommy, look!
- Watch him!

463
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,762
- There it goes.
- That's it, Louis.

464
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:17,138
- Go, Daddy.
- Higher, higher. We want it higher.

465
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:20,221
- Louis, let Gage do it.
- Here you go, buddy.

466
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,544
You're flying it.

467
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,872
- There's the kite!
- You got it.

468
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,128
Gage is flying it. You got it.

469
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,009
Can I fly it now?

470
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:54,088
In a minute, honey.
Let Gage finish his turn.

471
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,723
- We gotted it.
- You got it.

472
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,015
- Look high goes.
- Now farther. Go ahead.

473
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,938
Go ahead. Run, buddy. Run.

474
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,985
- Gage is flying it.
- I'm flying it.

475
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,321
That kite's getting up there.

476
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,774
Uh-oh.

477
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,244
It got away from him, that numb shit!

478
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,114
Ellen Creed!

479
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,165
I dropped it.

480
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,997
Daddy, can I fly it now?

481
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:31,383
- Okay, in just a minute.
- Louis, I want to fly it.

482
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:32,880
Uh-oh.

483
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,713
Daddy, Daddy, it's my turn now.

484
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,513
All right. Just a minute.

485
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,058
Don't let him go in the road, Louis!

486
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,640
Get him, Louis! Get the baby!

487
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:48,396
Get the baby!

488
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,487
Get the baby!

489
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,066
- Gage!
- Look out! Stop!

490
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,777
- Stop!
- Gage!

491
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:16,337
No!

492
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:20,682
<i>No!</i>

493
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,344
<i>No!</i>

494
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,805
Sedative finally took hold.

495
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,553
Rachel's asleep.

496
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,482
I want to go back to my own room.

497
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:18,942
I can't sleep with Mommy.
She keeps stealing the covers.

498
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,492
Ellie, what you got there?

499
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,618
What you got there? Let me see.

500
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:27,199
Can I see?

501
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,373
Ain't that real nice?

502
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,589
You pulling him in the wagon.

503
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,382
Bet he liked that, didn't he?

504
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,175
I'm going to carry this picture,
Mr. Crandall,

505
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,972
until God lets Gage come back.

506
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:47,177
Ellie, God doesn't do
things like that.

507
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,853
He can if he wants to.

508
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:53,646
I have to keep his things
waiting for him.

509
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,769
That's what I think.

510
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,108
I've got his picture.
And I'm gonna sit in his chair...

511
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,737
Ellie.

512
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:16,298
Louis, take care of your little girl.

513
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,874
She needs you.

514
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,353
I knew something
like this would happen.

515
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,840
I told her when you were first married

516
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,277
you'll have all the grief
you can stand and more, I said.

517
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,575
Now, look at this.

518
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,952
I hope you rot in hell!

519
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:48,746
Where were you
when he was playing in the road?

520
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,448
You stinking shit!

521
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,830
You killer of children!

522
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,082
- Daddy!
- Ellie!

523
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,257
- Stop it!
- You son of a bitch!

524
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,843
No! Oh, God!

525
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,094
- No!
- No!

526
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,722
- No!
- Louis!

527
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,223
Son of a bitch!

528
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:15,102
- You had no right!
- What's wrong with you?

529
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,732
It's your son's funeral.
Get a hold of yourself, please.

530
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,271
Good night, Ellie.

531
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,647
Good night, Daddy.

532
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,203
Daddy?

533
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:17,919
God could take it back
if he wanted to, couldn't he?

534
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,464
If he really, really wanted to.

535
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,549
Can I have faith in that?

536
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,090
Yes.

537
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,221
I suppose you can.

538
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,433
Good night, Ellie.

539
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,626
Fuck off, hairball.

540
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:51,133
Jud, I buried my son today.

541
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:56,392
I'm very tired.
I wonder if we could just...

542
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:00,267
You're thinking thoughts
best not thought of, Louis.

543
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,233
I'm thinking about going to bed.

544
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,229
I'm responsible for more pain
in your heart

545
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,235
than you should have tonight.

546
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,944
For all I know,
I may even be responsible

547
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,575
- for the death of your son.
- What?

548
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,661
Jud, you're talking crazy.

549
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:30,044
You are thinking
of putting him up there.

550
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:33,630
Don't deny the thought
hadn't crossed your mind, Louis.

551
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,851
Louis...

552
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,979
You asked me

553
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:52,986
if anyone had ever buried a person
up there in the Micmac grounds.

554
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,911
I lied to you when I said no.

555
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,538
It's been done.

556
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,209
What you've been thinking of
has been done.

557
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,462
He was a local boy.

558
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,876
It was towards the end
of the Second World War.

559
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,086
His name was Timmy Baterman.

560
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:18,137
<i>He was killed on his way home
from the Second World War.</i>

561
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:20,969
<i>His father, Bill Baterman,
was grief-struck.</i>

562
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,101
<i>He was so grief-struck,
he buried his son up there</i>

563
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,229
<i>before he ever had a chance
to get to the bottom of the truth.</i>

564
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,729
I'll bite, Jud.

565
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,109
What's the bottom of the truth?

566
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:39,241
Well, sometimes dead is better.

567
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,997
<i>The person you put up there
ain't the person that comes back.</i>

568
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:49,252
<i>It may look like that person,
but it ain't that person.</i>

569
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:53,005
<i>'Cause whatever lives in the ground</i>

570
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:57,840
<i>beyond the Pet Sematary
ain't human at all.</i>

571
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:04,016
It was four or five days
after Timmy's funeral

572
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,106
<i>that Margie Washburn seen Timmy</i>

573
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:10,105
<i>walking up the road
towards Yorkie's Livery.</i>

574
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,687
<i>As time went by,</i>

575
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:16,274
<i>lots of folks saw Timmy
walking back and forth.</i>

576
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,530
But it was Margie who finally came
to some of us menfolks

577
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,535
and said it had to be stopped.

578
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,035
She knew it was an abomination.

579
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,506
So us men sat down and talked it out.

580
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,751
<i>Then we got into my car</i>

581
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,990
<i>and went over to the Baterman place
to take care of it.</i>

582
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,425
He's dead! He ain't natural!

583
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:39,801
<i>One way or the other.</i>

584
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,474
Yeah, there's no other way.
He's got to burn!

585
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,053
You're wrecking my house! Stop it!

586
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,309
- Timmy, stop it!
- Daddy.

587
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,482
- Stop it!
- The place is going up!

588
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,027
- Go away!
- Get out while you still can, Bill.

589
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,358
- Bring out the cans.
- I got them.

590
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,926
Wait a minute, fellows. Wait a minute.

591
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,407
He's a monster, Bill!

592
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,621
Leave us alone! He's my son!

593
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,666
- Come, Timmy. Let's get out.
- Love Dad.

594
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:08,869
Hate living.

595
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,953
Come on, son!

596
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,916
No, Timmy! No!

597
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,922
Love Dad! Hate living.

598
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:20,255
<i>Louis, sometimes dead is better.</i>

599
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,803
<i>The Indians knew that.</i>

600
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:26,728
<i>They stopped using that burial ground
when the ground went sour.</i>

601
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,813
<i>Don't think about doing it, Louis.</i>

602
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:34,361
<i>The place gets hold of you,
but the place is evil.</i>

603
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,281
Sometimes, dead is better.

604
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,615
You see, Louis,
what I'm getting at here?

605
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,196
You understand?

606
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,083
You're telling me that place knew
Gage was going to die?

607
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,628
I'm saying

608
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:58,798
that place might have made Gage die
because I introduced you to the power.

609
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,260
I may have murdered your son, Louis.

610
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:15,776
This could be the beginning
of patching things up with your folks.

611
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:19,342
If something good doesn't
come from Gage's death, I think...

612
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:22,404
<i>Final call for
Inter-land Flight 61 to Chicago.</i>

613
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,489
<i>All passengers holding tickets
on Flight 61...</i>

614
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,117
I don't want to go to Chicago,
Grandma Dory.

615
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,700
- Why not, darling?
- I had a bad dream last night.

616
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:36,164
- About what?
- About Daddy and Gage

617
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,334
and someone named Paxcow.

618
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,920
You guys better get going,
or you're gonna miss the boat.

619
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,849
Louis, I am sorry.

620
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:52,230
- What can I say? I lost my mind.
- We all lost our minds, Irwin.

621
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,904
You take care of your mother, darling.

622
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,240
Come with us, Daddy.
Please come with us.

623
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,916
I'll be there in three days,
four at the most.

624
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,915
Please, Daddy, I'm scared.

625
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,381
Everything's going to be
all right, Ellie.

626
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,249
Do you swear?

627
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,428
I swear.

628
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,015
Come on, Ellie. Let's go.

629
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:36,432
<i>Final boarding call
for Inter-land Flight 61 to Chicago.</i>

630
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:39,519
<i>All passengers should now
be on board...</i>

631
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,277
It's wrong.

632
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:29,531
What happened to you is wrong.

633
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,404
Remember, Doc,

634
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:38,078
the barrier was not meant
to be crossed.

635
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:41,915
The ground is sour.

636
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,802
If it doesn't work,

637
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,856
if he comes back

638
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,608
and he's like Jud said
Timmy Baterman was,

639
01:03:06,408 --> 01:03:08,741
I'll just put him back to sleep.

640
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,370
<i>They don't have to know.</i>

641
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,787
<i>Rachel and Ellie
don't ever have to know.</i>

642
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:27,752
Mommy. Mommy.

643
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,715
Mommy! Mommy.

644
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,892
Mommy! Mommy!

645
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:38,642
Honey, you just had a bad dream,
that's all. You know that, don't you?

646
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:42,692
It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow.

647
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:47,192
Paxcow says Daddy's
gonna do something really bad.

648
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:50,116
Who is this Paxcow?
Is he like the bogeyman?

649
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:53,285
He's a ghost. He's a good ghost.

650
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:55,738
He says he was sent to warn us.

651
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,291
He says he was near Daddy
because they were together

652
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:02,336
when his soul was dis...

653
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:10,257
- I can't remember.
- Listen to me.

654
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:13,969
There are no ghosts, Ellie.
There are no ghosts.

655
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,767
Now I want you to go to sleep
and forget all this nonsense.

656
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,266
Do you hear me?

657
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:24,067
Will you at least call
and make sure Daddy's okay?

658
01:04:24,152 --> 01:04:25,859
Of course I will.

659
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,553
Paxcow? Where do I know that name?

660
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,507
- Pascow.
- Pascow?

661
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,763
Was she saying Pascow?

662
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:02,972
<i>He was trying to help me
because Daddy was helping him</i>

663
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,728
<i>when his soul dis...</i>

664
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,855
Discorporated.

665
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,074
I'm going to bust you out, son.

666
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,142
He's not home.

667
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,155
Probably went out for a hamburger
or a chicken dinner, dear.

668
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:55,904
You know how men are
when they're alone.

669
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,040
Hello?

670
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,999
Hello, Jud. It's Rachel Creed.
I'm calling from Chicago.

671
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,835
<i>Chicago? Is Louis with you?</i>

672
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:17,137
No. We're going to be here a while,

673
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,806
and he needed a few days
to close things up back there.

674
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,227
<i>I just wondered if he was with you.</i>

675
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:24,804
No.

676
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,687
But if he drops by,
I'll tell him to call you.

677
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,815
- Don't bother, Jud. I'm coming home.
- Rachel, no.

678
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:35,444
<i>- You don't want to do that.</i>
- I have to do it, Jud. Goodbye.

679
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,034
Rachel! Rachel!

680
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:09,834
You've done it, you stupid old man.
Now you got to undo it.

681
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,100
Gage.

682
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,447
It's going to be all right.

683
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:48,823
I swear it's going to be all right.

684
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:53,812
I'm coming for you, Rachel.

685
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,892
And this time,

686
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,396
I'll get you.

687
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:08,652
Gage and I

688
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,080
will get you

689
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,705
for letting us die.

690
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:23,425
<i>Good evening again,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

691
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,128
<i>We've had a strong tailwind
and we expect to arrive</i>

692
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:29,386
<i>at Boston's Logan Airport
almost on time.</i>

693
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,057
Thank God.

694
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:39,559
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

695
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,651
Excuse me.

696
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,947
Excuse me. Excuse me.

697
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,955
Excuse me. Excuse me.

698
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:03,965
Don't do that, babe.

699
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:07,924
- Make it wait.
- I can't.

700
01:11:08,306 --> 01:11:10,423
All right. I'll call the pilot.

701
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,977
I'm not going to stop, Gage.

702
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,152
I'm not going to look down.

703
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:46,067
I'm sorry. It's been very busy.
I really don't have anything.

704
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:49,487
What about the Aries K,
the one with the scratch on its side?

705
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:54,451
I do have an Aries K,
but it came in rather beat-up

706
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,199
and there's a long scrape up one side.

707
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,996
I'll take it.

708
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,916
Okay. Major credit card and a license.

709
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,188
<i>Louis.</i>

710
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,866
See?

711
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,378
Just imagination.

712
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,925
- Now what?
- It's trying to stop you.

713
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:44,056
Do you hear me?
It's trying to stop you.

714
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,860
Is anyone there?

715
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:17,210
Come back to me, Gage.

716
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,140
Come back to us.

717
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,235
Hey!

718
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,536
Hey, stop!

719
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:39,217
- Hop in, babe.
- Thank you.

720
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,523
Oh, my.

721
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,889
Who's here?

722
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:01,817
Let's play hide and go seek.

723
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,001
Gage?

724
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,175
You the one playing games?

725
01:20:00,838 --> 01:20:01,954
Gage?

726
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,208
Come on out.

727
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,844
I brought you something.

728
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:50,210
Where did you...

729
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:56,697
- Thank you so much.
- Think nothing of it.

730
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:01,205
Hell, I didn't get a ticket, lady,
so you're welcome.

731
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,749
Whatever your problems are,
I hope they work out.

732
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:07,625
It's the end of the line for me, too.
I'm not allowed any further.

733
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:11,674
- I'm sure things will be fine.
- I'm not.

734
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:23,765
Rachel!

735
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:54,918
Church?

736
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:03,426
Jud?

737
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:12,689
Jud?

738
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,348
Jud, are you up there?

739
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:20,007
Rachel.

740
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:26,426
Rachel.

741
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:35,811
Rachel, is that you?

742
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,484
I finally came back for you, Rachel.

743
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:43,075
I'm going to twist your back like mine

744
01:24:43,161 --> 01:24:46,120
so you'll never get out of bed again.

745
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,451
Never get out of bed again.

746
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:52,911
Never get out of bed again!

747
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:56,089
Never get out of bed again!

748
01:25:10,063 --> 01:25:11,850
Gage.

749
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,024
- I brought you something, Mommy.
- Gage.

750
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:23,574
I brought you something, Mommy.

751
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,834
Gage. Gage.

752
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:36,501
I brought you something, Mommy.

753
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,888
Oh, Christ.

754
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,187
Gage.

755
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:23,592
Oh, my God.

756
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:29,052
Gage?

757
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:57,960
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, Louis.</i>

758
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:02,381
<i>It's Irwin. I just wanted to be sure
Rachel got back all right.</i>

759
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,212
<i>Louis? Are you there?</i>

760
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:11,258
- Yes, I'm here.
<i>- Did she get back all right?</i>

761
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:13,930
Yes. She's fine.

762
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:17,730
<i>Well, put her on at that end,
and I'll put Ellie on this one.</i>

763
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,105
<i>Ellie's very worried about her mother.</i>

764
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:24,187
<i>- She's almost in hysterics.</i>
- She's...

765
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,572
- Rachel's asleep.
<i>- I suggest you wake her up.</i>

766
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:33,075
<i>Ellie had a dream
that her mother was dead.</i>

767
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,373
Irwin, I can't talk to you right now.

768
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:56,644
Irwin, I told you
I can't talk to you right now.

769
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,894
<i>I'm at Jud's, Daddy.
Will you come over and play with me?</i>

770
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,610
<i>First I played with Jud.</i>

771
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:07,780
<i>Then Mommy came,
and I played with Mommy.</i>

772
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:12,072
<i>We played, Daddy.
We had an awful good time.</i>

773
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,159
<i>Now I want to play with you.</i>

774
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,782
What did you do?

775
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:23,371
What did you do?

776
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:38,136
Hi, Church.

777
01:28:39,272 --> 01:28:41,889
Want some grub, Church? Church.

778
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:56,867
Don't mind me.

779
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,583
Eat it while you can.

780
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,005
That's right.

781
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:11,336
Today is Thanksgiving Day for cats.

782
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:15,340
But only

783
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,969
if they came back from the dead.

784
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:45,461
Go on. Lie down.

785
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:49,461
Play dead.

786
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:53,961
Be dead!

787
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:27,495
Gage?

788
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:38,138
Gage?

789
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,107
Gage, what have you done?

790
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,200
Rachel!

791
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,253
Scared you, didn't I?

792
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:19,922
- Gage?
- Hi, Daddy.

793
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,929
Now I want to play with you.

794
01:31:31,653 --> 01:31:32,985
All right, Gage.

795
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,240
Let's play.

796
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:20,648
Daddy.

797
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:28,452
Come here.

798
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:38,749
Come here.

799
01:35:02,947 --> 01:35:04,859
No fair.

800
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,820
No fair, no fair.

801
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:36,823
I'm sorry, Louis. I'm so sorry.

802
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:40,959
But don't make it worse. Don't.

803
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,913
I waited too long with Gage.

804
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:49,173
With Rachel, it will work this time,
because she just died.

805
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:51,345
She just died a little while ago.

806
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,348
Louis, don't!

807
01:36:58,438 --> 01:37:01,272
Please, Louis!

808
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:05,442
No!

809
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,989
It will be all right, Rachel.

810
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,783
I promise.

811
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:45,858
<i>The soil of a man's heart
is stonier, Louis.</i>

812
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:50,404
<i>A man grows what he can,
then he tends it.</i>

813
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:55,492
<i>Because what you buy is what you own.</i>

814
01:37:56,996 --> 01:38:01,912
<i>And what you own
always comes home to you.</i>

815
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:15,106
Darling.

816
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,798
<i>No!</i>
